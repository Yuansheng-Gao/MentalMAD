I've been trying to get through to you, but you keep pushing me away.\nPerson2: Maybe that's because you keep reminding me of my past. If you go away, then I'll forget.\nPerson1: Forget what? Forget how you're feeling right now?\nPerson2: You never answer me. You just keep probing, trying to get inside my head.\nPerson1: I'm trying to understand you, Rachel. But you're not making it easy.\nPerson2: Understand me? You think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice?"}
