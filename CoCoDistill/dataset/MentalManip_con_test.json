Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?\nPerson1: I never went in that sphere.\nPerson2: You don't remember you did.

You remember that.\nPerson1: Yes.\nPerson2: You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  \"Like everything's on the tip of my tongue\", he said.\nPerson1: That's nonsense.\nPerson2: Is it?\nPerson1: Beth, the message said Harry.  \"My name is Harry\".  My name isn't Harry.\nPerson2: No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  \"Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming.\" \"But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared.\" \"C'mon, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.\"  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?\nPerson1: Stop it, Beth --\nPerson2: When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  \"I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water.\" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?",

Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?\nPerson2: I reckon not.\nPerson1: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.\nPerson2: Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.\nPerson1: Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?\nPerson2: I've heard it said that way.\nPerson1: Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?\nPerson2: I wouldn't never hurt them.\nPerson1: That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?",

I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become.

And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.\nPerson1: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?\nPerson2: Jesus, you're caustic.\nPerson1: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.\nPerson2: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.\nPerson1: Good. Stay in that frame of mind.\nPerson2: But can we date?\nPerson1: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.\nPerson2: We could introduce them. They might hit it off.\nPerson1: You're serious. You want to date again.\nPerson2: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.\nPerson1: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years.

Maybe we should just see what happens.\nPerson2: Let me take you out tonight.\nPerson1: You mean, on a date?\nPerson2: Yes. A real date.

I think I've been on that one before.\nPerson2: You have a better suggestion?\nPerson1: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?\nPerson2: I hear that's a rather popular date.\nPerson1: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.\nPerson2: What about Sing?\nPerson1: Sang.\nPerson2: Sang.\nPerson1: He's not invited.\nPerson2: He's your fianc.\nPerson1: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.

Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.\nPerson1: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.\nPerson2: Who doesn't?\nPerson1: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.\nPerson2: What happened to the walk and the nakedness?\nPerson1: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.

Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?\nPerson2: Bits and pieces.\nPerson1: She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.\nPerson2: And what about your own hand?\nPerson1: No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?\nPerson1: It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.\nPerson2: Oh, yeah?\nPerson1: Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.\nPerson2: And how do you bluff yourself?\nPerson1: Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?
