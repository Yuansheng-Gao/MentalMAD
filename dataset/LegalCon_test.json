{"id": "823", "dialogue": "Judge: Gary Northr, you are suing your ex-wife Karen Northr for $2,710 that you say was overpaid to her in child support. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yes, in 2013 I was made aware of some of my children legally allowed to be emancipated, and I have been overpaying.\n\nJudge: Why were they emancipated?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): One graduated college, one had actually found out how old they were—21, 22, and I think my son was 19.\n\nJudge: Did you not realize that child support ends at some point?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yes, but the court order said 22 if they were going to school, and I have very little to no contact with my kids.\n\nJudge: Well, that’s sad.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): It is. There’s a long, drawn-out history, and I’ve been fighting in courts for years, and thank God I’ve been winning all the time.\n\nJudge: Well, it doesn’t sound like you’re a winner when you have no contact with your children. How many children do you have?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I have four with her.\n\nJudge: How many children do you have altogether?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Five.\n\nJudge: And you have no contact with any of the four?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Just my son. He showed up on my door when she kicked him out. He wanted a new life away from her. He was trying to get back with his wife.\n\nJudge: Okay, but we digress. Let's go to the overpayment in 2013. What is it that happens in 2013? You realize that either your child is not in school or the age has come or something?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yes, and so I go to court and say, \"Hey,\" and I show the order to the judge, and the judge says, \"You're right.\" From this day forward, it will be X.\n\nJudge: The court told me when I went and filed that it would be retroactive from the date of filing. The judge told me that, and it's in... is it in an order? Let me see the order. I've got so many.\n\nJudge: Okay, what happens after the order is entered on October 17th? How long does it take child support to figure out how to obey the order?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): About a month.\n\nJudge: And so from then on, they obey the order, but you point out to the child support people, \"Wait, I need to be getting credit because the judge lowered the child support payment retroactive to August 16th.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): And what do they say?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Put it nicely, tough. When I got the order, I faxed it to them right away, and they called me and said, \"We don't do that. Talk to me.\"\n\nJudge: According to him, he overpaid you in 2013, and then it happened again but with a much smaller amount in 2016. How would that happen?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Because it got modified again in 2016.\n\nJudge: It got modified again?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Yes, because you went out on disability.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yes, per my disability.\n\nJudge: So now, according to him, you have been overpaid $2,710. What’s your position on this?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): That’s not the truth, and there is nothing in the order that reads he’s to receive anything retroactive.\n\nJudge: It is in the order.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Well, the judge here, it’s circled right here on this page, highlighted in yellow, retroactive to August whatever.\n\nJudge: It's right in the order, which they did modify the order. So I’m not understanding.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Right, but not retroactive till August 16th.\n\nJudge: Right, like they didn’t give him any credit for payments. It appears the judge is saying he was overpaying. He wasn’t supposed to be paying that child support because the child was emancipated. We don’t let people sit on their hands forever. We don’t say, “Oh, let’s go back to the date of emancipation.” He’s got to do something, but he did something on August 16th. That’s when he filed it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so based on these documents, you are suing for $1,130 in overpayment. Every two weeks, they were taking out $483, when clearly a judge had said they were only supposed to be taking out $210 from that day forward. So they can’t just take their sweet time. They say they can, but they can’t. That’s why he’s here suing you. And now let me ask you a question. How long have you been divorced from him?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): We legally separated December 20, 1997. I went to a battered women’s shelter with the four children at the time—two, four, five, and six—because of his abuse. We didn’t actually get divorced until 2005.\n\nJudge: Did you ever call the police on him for physical abuse?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Many, many times, and they did absolutely nothing, because he’d run out and greet the cops at the curb, and he had his story.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): So basically, it was 1997. It came down to this. This is before any good laws actually started happening for our benefit, so we divorced in 2005 eventually.\n\nJudge: Okay, but what? So did he see his kids?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): No, that’s never been the case.\n\nJudge: Not from the...?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): Had visitation with them through 2005. Then he moved to Florida, and then he didn’t really make any effort to have contact with them. So visitation at that point ceased.\n\nJudge: Come on up. How old are you?\n\nDefendant’s Child: I’m 20.\n\nJudge: Hi, my dear. Hi. So if you’re 20, you don’t really remember them together very much, do you?\n\nDefendant’s Child: Not really, no.\n\nJudge: Do you remember any abuse?\n\nDefendant’s Child: No, but your mom’s told you about it?\n\nDefendant’s Child: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Do you have any contact with him?\n\nDefendant’s Child: No.\n\nJudge: Have you ever had any contact with him?\n\nDefendant’s Child: Not since I was younger.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you have a relationship with your children?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I mean, I imagine the day your children were born, you were happy, right? Like you were a happy couple having four kids, not one, not two...\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I wasn’t working. I had the kids the first two years of... no, no, listen to my question. Why don’t you talk to your children?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): She won’t allow it.\n\nJudge: But since when does she get to be the arbiter of whether or not you talk to your children?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): It’s been almost 20 years.\n\nJudge: I have... Why did you let it happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Well, this is my beautiful wife Rosa.\n\nJudge: How long has Rosa been in the picture?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): We’ve been together 11 years. We’ve been married for six.\n\nJudge: And does Rosa ever talk to you about this and say maybe you should have a relationship with your children?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): We tried. We’ve talked. That’s why she... My... she’s a blessing, because she helped me with my son. She... she paid almost half to set him up in a new life in Florida. We spent over $7,000,000, and she gave me half of that money to help my son. We’re very close to his in-laws. We still talk to the in-laws. We are allowed to see my grandson. They have it down there.\n\nJudge: Is there anything else you want to say?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): No, I just want truth. That’s all I ask.\n\nJudge: Do you comment on the allegations that she made against you?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yeah, it’s all false. If you can investigate family court, she was convicted for interfering with my parental rights on four counts.\n\nJudge: Did you beat her?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever hit her?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I admitted to defending myself with her one time because she was the abusive one, and she would go tell them what she did to me.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Also in criminal court, how many times were the police called to your house?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I can’t believe I... I don’t know. How many times did you get arrested for it?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): She had me arrested on phone calls, four times, and I went to jail for overnight phone calls that were violating a restraining order. That’s what she claimed. But no.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): What did you... What were you charged with if you went to jail?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Threatening phone calls, making threatening phone calls.\n\nJudge: Okay, was there a restraining order in effect?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yes.    Judge: So, you had a restraining order in effect, and you were still calling her?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): Yeah, I was trying to contact my children, and I didn't realize that I was violating it. I was just trying to keep in touch.\n\nJudge: Well, you should have known. When there's a restraining order, you can’t make contact.\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I understand that now. I just wanted to be a part of my children’s lives.\n\nJudge: So why don’t you reach out now, instead of bringing all this back to court? Why don’t you make an effort?\n\nPlaintiff (Gary Northr): I tried, but she has made it difficult. I’ve tried to reach out, and every time I do, she shuts it down.\n\nJudge: How about you? Do you have any thoughts on this? Why won’t you let him have contact with his children?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): He didn’t show interest in being a father. He doesn’t deserve to come back into our lives after all this time. We’ve moved on, and the kids have moved on. I protected them from his abuse, and I’m not going to allow him to hurt them again.\n\nJudge: So you’re still holding onto the past?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): No, I’m protecting my children. He doesn’t have a right to just come back into their lives after all the damage he caused.\n\nJudge: You know, there’s a lot of emotion here, but we’re talking about child support and money, not just feelings. The law doesn’t operate on emotions, but on facts.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): I understand that, but what I’m saying is he hasn’t been involved in their lives for so long, it’s not just about the money. It’s about the history.\n\nJudge: Okay, so let's focus on the money. You acknowledge that he overpaid, right?\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): No, I don’t. I don’t believe that’s true. He’s just trying to get money back, but it’s not accurate. The child support was paid as it was ordered.\n\nJudge: But according to the court order, there was a retroactive adjustment. And based on that, you should’ve refunded the money, or at least applied it correctly. That’s why we’re here.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): I understand the order, but the money was being paid and processed. I didn’t have any part in that. It was up to the child support office.\n\nJudge: I’m hearing that you’re saying the office should’ve handled it, but you also knew the situation, and you were aware of the overpayment.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): I didn’t know the full details. I wasn’t keeping track of all the payments. I trusted the system.\n\nJudge: Well, the system has failed here. He overpaid, and there’s documentation to prove it. You need to refund the money or make it right.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): I understand, but I can’t give back what I didn’t receive directly. The payments went through the system.\n\nJudge: That’s not how it works. You were the one receiving the payments, and you’re responsible for ensuring that the child support was applied properly.\n\nDefendant (Karen Northr): I don’t agree with that. But if that’s how it’s going to be, then I’ll figure it out.\n\nJudge: Okay. I’m going to review the evidence, and I’ll make my decision.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Emotional Appeal, Minimization, Deflection"}

{"id": "664", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Douglas. Tiffany Archer, you are suing your—what is he of yours?\n\nPlaintiff: He was an acquaintance with benefits.\n\nJudge: Your former something, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Jarell Bryant, for $4,050 that you say he owes you in loans, a cable bill, a Bluetooth speaker he broke, and $2,000 for intentional tort.\n\nJudge: All right. And you are counterclaiming her for pain and suffering for bed bugs. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. Um, we started dating in October. We met before then. He was working for a cab service. His work started to slow down, and then he expressed interest in working for Uber.\n\nPlaintiff: Now, there are things that I acknowledge that are gifts. There are things that I purchased for him. There are things that I’ve given to him. I’m suing for the $1,650 because one portion was for a vehicle so that he could obtain work with the company. And the extra $150—\n\nJudge: He didn’t even have a car, but he wanted to be an Uber driver? Don’t you need a car first?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So you were buying him the car so he could be an Uber driver?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So if I called Uber and he answered, I was going to be riding around in a $1,000 car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, actually, I gave him $1,500 for the car.\n\nJudge: That makes me feel so much better.\n\nPlaintiff: No, I gave him—\n\nJudge: Did you buy a car with $1,500 that you could use for Uber?\n\nDefendant: Um, I bought a car, but I didn’t use it for Uber.\n\nJudge: What car did you buy?\n\nDefendant: Uh, I bought an Impala.\n\nJudge: What year?\n\nDefendant: 2007.\n\nJudge: Did you tell her that you wanted to borrow money so you could buy a car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Where did this Uber stuff come from?\n\nDefendant: Um, well, I was driving cabs, and, you know, Uber’s a hot thing, so I was interested in becoming an Uber driver, but you know, I—I drive a gypsy cab.\n\nJudge: And did she loan you the money for the car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did she give you the money for the car?\n\nDefendant: Why would she give me that money?\n\nJudge: Um, you tell me.\n\nDefendant: We were an item.\n\nJudge: So what? I don’t—nobody rains money on me. I’ve been an item with a lot of people. They don’t rain money on me like that. I’m cute!\n\nJudge: Did you have him sign a promissory note?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not.\n\nJudge: What were you doing that you were able to give away money to your boyfriend—so much?\n\nPlaintiff: I work as a home health aide. I do live-in, and I work four days at a time. So I go in on Thursday and come off on Monday.\n\nPlaintiff: But prior to this, the situation I was in, um, my home was in foreclosure, and we were paid out. And I had already saved money up, so I was okay.\n\nJudge: So you couldn’t wait to get rid of it.\n\nPlaintiff: It’s just that I—I help people if I’m okay.\n\nJudge: And how often do you get burned?\n\nPlaintiff: A lot.\n\nJudge: Okay. I have a philosophy that you should only pay for someone else if you don’t mind seeing it go away. Because you will end up with a lot of broken friendships.\n\nJudge: So if you want to help somebody out in their time of need, why don’t you just get it in writing?\n\nJudge: So when is the first time that there’s any discussion between the two of you that you want him to pay you back?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, when I gave it to him, I told him right off as soon as I handed him the money.\n\nPlaintiff: As soon as he got the money—because the text comes to my phone—I wired it from Western Union because I was at work at the time.\n\nJudge: Yeah, you’re burning Western Union’s wires. How many times did you wire money?\n\nPlaintiff: I would say five, six, seven. Around about five times, probably, in the process of me—\n\nJudge: Did she tell you when she gave you the money that you would have to pay it back?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: And that’s what we guard against by having a promissory note. Or even a text that says it.\n\nJudge: If you’re too embarrassed—if you think, \"Oh, I don’t want to seem like I don’t trust him by making him sign a promissory note\"—I don’t know why, but if that’s what’s in your head, then just send a text saying, \"I’m so glad I was able to help you. When do you think you can pay me back?\"\n\nJudge: \"Oh, don’t worry, I’ll be able to pay you back in a few months.\"\n\nJudge: Done. That’s a contract. There’s no dispute about whether it’s a loan or a gift, right?\n\nJudge: If you’re suing for money you gave him for a car, money you gave him for insurance, money you gave him for a cable bill that you opened up in your name—\n\nJudge: You think you’re going to—You’re moving in? What do you think?      Plaintiff: No, the thing is, because he's in a niche, and he gets his rent paid through public assistance. Because I'm standing here, a lot of people that stay with you, they don't like to pull their weight. So I said, while I'm staying, at least let me—\n\nJudge: But you're not even supposed to be staying there though, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I wasn't, but I wasn't planning on living there. But I just—\n\nJudge: But you just put a bill in your name there. And when you put a bill in your name there, you had to pay $100. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: That's actually the cable bill.\n\nJudge: No, the cable bill was $139. But the bank statements that I got, it doesn't show the other half where I paid. But why does he have to pay you back the $100?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, because when I left, we made an agreement that, being that I was not going to stay there, he was going to continue to pay the bill. He has others entertaining—family and friends—cable, right? And I'm not staying there.\n\nJudge: Why don't you just cancel the cable? Why didn't you just do that? Why would you trust a guy to pay the bill? Did he pay the bill?\n\nPlaintiff: He did, for the first—And it's just that the last bill he didn't pay.\n\nJudge: But he owes you $100 on the cable?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: How not?\n\nDefendant: I don’t—\n\nJudge: Show me the proof of everything you paid on the cable.\n\nDefendant: I don’t have any proof.\n\nJudge: Okay, well then, you owe her $100 on the cable if you don't have any proof.\n\nJudge: Broken Bluetooth speaker—What happened there?\n\nDefendant: Um, she left a speaker. I don’t remember her leaving a speaker. She came back, and it was broke. I had a bunch of kids in my house.\n\nJudge: And then what did you do with the speaker?\n\nDefendant: I threw it away. It was broke.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that speaker didn’t break itself. You owe her for the speaker. Another $100. I don’t like that at all.\n\nJudge: Intentional tort—What do you mean when you say intentional tort? Somebody did a little reading on the internet.\n\nPlaintiff: Intentional tort, yes. Because, um, I feel that he misrepresented himself when he asked for the car. I thought he was actually going to get a job, try to better himself, make better of his situation so he could take better care of himself and pay me back. So this is why I loaned him the money for the car.\n\nJudge: So you want—So the intentional tort is you chose unwisely?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I feel like he misrepresented himself.\n\nJudge: All right. So now let me ask you about your lawsuit.\n\nDefendant: Oh, okay, yeah.\n\nJudge: Bed bugs and pain and suffering—Talk to me.\n\nDefendant: All right, so Tiffany had moved into an apartment, and they had, um, I guess a pre-existing bed bug situation. And you know, she was staying at my house Monday through Wednesday towards the middle—Towards the beginning—And you know, I mean, it felt a little funny, a little itchy and stuff, but I can say by the time she left, I had a bed bug situation. You know, I had to call housing, get them to deal with it.\n\nJudge: Can I see proof of that?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Did you have a bed bug situation in the house that you were in?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I'm trying to imagine. So I have a bed bug situation—Can I come stay with you? Let me take my—I'll just bring my sheets and my luggage and everything else a bed bug can hitch a ride on. Let’s do that. That sounds like a—like a capital idea!\n\nDefendant: Says we exterminating for gnats and water bugs and mice.\n\nJudge: Whoa! You're living in a—No. You see, they came for roaches and rats. They came to spray for everything. When you tell them you have a problem with bugs, they come and handle everything.\n\nJudge: Okay, target organism, though, is what you complained about. And that was roaches.\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: And that was in March. Anyway, where—Where am I finding a bed bug problem that she brought into your place?\n\nDefendant: This is July of 2018.\n\nJudge: When were you there?\n\nPlaintiff: December of 2017.\n\nJudge: Yes. Right. This is July of 2018. This is the other day. So where’s your proof that she caused a bed bug problem that would entitle you to $3,000?\n\nJudge: I mean, listen, bed bug lawsuits are awful because it is really hard to determine who brought in the bed bug. Nobody knows but the bed bug, and the bed bug ain't talking.\n\nJudge: So it's very hard to—But assuming, okay, that she—I mean, yours is a better case than most because she had bed bugs and then went to your house to stay, which was—No offense—On your part. But okay.\n\nJudge: Except here’s the problem I'm having. I'm not finding you complaining to the housing authority to spray, and it's free. When you complain to them to spray, they just do it. You don’t have to pay for it, nothing. Right?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: I don’t see you complaining about it until four months after she moves out.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Harvey Levin here. So, um, if you loan a friend money, do you expect payment back, or do you just think, \"Whatever, if he pays back, great. If not—\"?\n\n[Public Opinions and Responses]\n\nJudge: Technically, she never originally moved in because, like I told her, I wasn't ready for no relationship. But she gets out of work, she comes straight to my house Monday morning, and she’ll stay till Wednesday.\n\nJudge: Okay. When did you two break up?\n\nDefendant: Huh?\n\nJudge: When did you two stop making love to each other, or having sex, or whatever you guys want to call it? I don’t know what to call it.\n\nDefendant: I don't know.\n\nJudge: I don’t find a complaint until March 19th.\n\nPlaintiff: If I may say—\n\nJudge: And they sprayed for everything. The target on March 19th—They may have sprayed for bed bugs, but the target on March 19th was roaches.\n\nDefendant: I told them I had bugs. They said they were going to come handle the bugs.\n\nJudge: You know what? If you had bed bugs, you'd know. You claim you had to throw out furniture. Do you have any proof you had to throw out furniture?\n\nDefendant: Um, no. I didn’t bring it.\n\nJudge: No, because she has pictures of you on the furniture you say you threw out.\n\nDefendant: Yeah, but that was, like—How many months ago?\n\nPlaintiff: November.\n\nJudge: I don’t know. When was that?\n\nPlaintiff: January 21st.\n\nJudge: January.\n\nDefendant: It takes a while for the bugs to grow, you know? They come little, and then they take time to sprout out.\n\nJudge: I had them, so I would know. It is a disaster.   Defendant: Yeah, it was bad.\n\nJudge: But what I'm saying is, when you claim you threw away furniture, I want to see some proof that you actually threw away furniture.\n\nDefendant: Well, I don’t have any.\n\nJudge: You don’t have any. So I’m looking at a lawsuit for $3,000 for pain and suffering and damages, and you don't have any proof that you actually threw out furniture. You also waited months before complaining to housing about it.\n\nJudge: So you want me to make the leap that she brought the bed bugs, but your own timeline is inconsistent.\n\nDefendant: Well, I didn't really think about it like that. I just know I had them, and I didn't have them before she started coming around.\n\nJudge: Okay. But bed bugs don’t just immediately show up and take over in a few days. They take time to spread. You didn't complain until months later. So, I’m denying your claim for $3,000.\n\nJudge: Now, back to your case, ma’am.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You’re suing for the car money, the insurance money, and the cable bill. I’m awarding you the cable bill portion—$100—since he failed to show proof of payment.\n\nJudge: As for the car money, you’re calling it a loan. He’s calling it a gift. Do you have anything in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but we had a verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: A verbal agreement is only as good as the proof you have to back it up. You don’t have text messages? Emails? Anything that states he was supposed to pay you back?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I just trusted him.\n\nJudge: That was your mistake. Without proof that it was a loan and not a gift, I can’t force him to pay you back. I’m dismissing that portion of your case.\n\nPlaintiff: But—\n\nJudge: No, I understand. It’s unfair. It’s frustrating. But legally, I can’t enforce an agreement I don’t have proof of.\n\nJudge: So here’s my final ruling—Plaintiff is awarded $100 for the cable bill and $100 for the broken speaker. Defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed.\n\nJudge: Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $200.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, deflection, exaggeration, framing the narrative"}
{"id": "57", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Bilal Arif. He says he and the defendant were co-workers, and when the defendant fell on hard times, he helped him out by loaning him a grand. He told him he’d deduct a portion of the loan amount from his paycheck until the loan was paid off. Everything was good until the plaintiff left his position. Now he can’t get the defendant to pay him the $1,000 he still owes. That’s why he’s here suing.\n\nThis is the defendant, Christopher. He says the plaintiff was terminated from his position and eventually went to work for him, and the plaintiff stiffed him on his wages. He has some nerve suing him here today in court because if anyone is owed money, it’s certainly not the plaintiff.\n\nHe’s accused of not paying a guy back. The defendant has filed a counterclaim for $2,700 for unpaid wages. All parties, please be ready.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case in the docket: The plaintiff loaned a grand to his coworker and got stiffed, but the defendant says the plaintiff was fired and he ended up working for him—and he stiffed him on wages. It’s the case of ‘Ain’t Nothing Grand About You.’ Thank you, Douglas.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, Bilal Arif, you are suing Christopher for a $1,000 loan that you say you made to him and he hasn’t repaid. You have counterclaimed against him for $2,700 in unpaid wages. Let me talk to you first.

And were you friends?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, we were pretty good friends.\n\n**Judge:** Would you socialize outside the store?\n\n**Plaintiff:** We met like two to three times.\n\n**Judge:** All right. Now, at some point, you loaned him money?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** How much money did you loan him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $1,500.\n\n**Judge:** Did he pay you back any of it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor. The last week that he was working with me and the new management, he told me to keep whatever I worked for and let him know how much he owed me after that. So it was like $406, and then he gave me $100 afterward. That’s how he paid off $500 of the $1,500, and then according to you, he still owes you $1,000?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. What’s going on?\n\n**Defendant:** So basically, it was not a loan. He says that he was just an employee—he wasn’t just an employee. He was invested 50% owner with the first boss we were working for.\n\n**Judge:** Is that accurate?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor, it is.\n\n**Defendant:** Then when those two partners split, he took his investment from the first boss and went with the second boss. So basically, the money he gave me was an incentive to come work with him.\n\n**Judge:** So according to you, the $1,500 was an incentive for you to come work with him?\n\n**Defendant:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** Did you let him take $500 for repayment of something that was supposed to be an incentive?\n\n**Defendant:** He took it off himself. I never received any pay from the time that I worked for them. They kept giving me the runaround.\n\n**Judge:** When you say ‘they,’ you mean him and the new owner?\n\n**Defendant:** Correct. They kept telling me they were going to have a meeting later, that I could come pick up my pay at the meeting, but then the meeting ended up not happening.\n\n**Judge:** How many days did you work at that new place?\n\n**Defendant:** About three weeks.\n\n**Judge:** And then what did you do?\n\n**Defendant:** I went back to the old place because I didn’t have any income.\n\n**Judge:** Did you guys not pay him at all?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, Your Honor. He was paid.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have proof that you paid him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor. I have text messages.\n\n**Judge:** That’s not proof that you paid him. Do you have a pay stub?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, he got paid in cash because the owner didn’t have things set up properly at that time.\n\n**Judge:** If you’re not doing things right, don’t open a business. But in the text messages, can I see any proof of payment?\n\n**Defendant:** Those texts just show him saying things like, “That was two days’ pay, right?”\n\n**Judge:** There are a lot of texts here. I see you telling him you need money, saying, ‘I’ll pay you back Friday.’ What did you mean?\n\n**Defendant:** That was for phones we purchased together and were selling.\n\n**Judge:** Why are you saying you’ll bring him money if you don’t owe him money?\n\n**Defendant:** Some of those texts refer to other deals we had.\n\n**Judge:** Why do you keep promising to pay $500 one week and $500 the next?\n\n**Defendant:** That was supposed to be for phones.\n\n**Judge:** Did you ever pay it?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Then you owe him $1,000.\n\nYour counterclaim for $2,700 for unpaid wages—if you have unpaid wages, you have to sue the corporation, not him directly. You have to sue the corporation. So I am dismissing your counterclaim without prejudice for you to sue the corporation.\n\nOn his claim against you—pay him the $1,000.\n\n**Judge:** Christopher, you’ve got to pay him $1,000.\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah. Next time, I know better about who I deal with.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Arif, are you happy?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, definitely.\n\n**Judge:** You’re not working with him still, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, it’s done.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, good.

We are here today to hear the case of the plaintiff, Mr. John Smith, versus the defendant, Ms. Lisa Johnson.

However, there were delays due to supply chain issues, and Mr. Smith refused to pay for additional materials. He also made changes to the project that extended the timeline.\r\n\r\n**Judge:** Mr. Smith, did you request additional changes?\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff:** I asked for minor adjustments, but nothing that should have delayed the project by this much.

But I was willing to complete the work if Mr. Smith paid for the extra costs.\r\n\r\n**Judge:** Based on this contract and evidence, it seems that you were responsible for completing the work within the agreed timeframe. Mr. Smith paid a significant amount in advance, and the work is incomplete. I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff.

{"id": "981", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff bought an English bulldog from the defendant, but the dog has hip dysplasia, and the plaintiff wants the cost of the surgery. The defendant says there is no hard proof the dog has a problem. It’s the case of the dog that wasn’t hip.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mr. Boey, you are suing Sharon Nunley, doing business as Nunley Ranch and Nunley Ranch Bulldogs, for $1,600—$1,000 of it the amount you paid for the dog, and $600 for missed work and time spent trying to resolve this lawsuit. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: I bought her when she was four months old. I got—bring her out here.\n\nJudge: You brought her all this way? Hi there. What's the name of that dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Bella.\n\nJudge: Bella, yeah. And what kind of dog is that?\n\nPlaintiff: Old English Bulldog.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I bought her in October. I bought her for a companion because I go over the road.\n\nJudge: Are you a truck driver?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I am.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: All 48 states she’s been to—I believe 27.\n\nJudge: Okay. A well-traveled canine.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I got travel glasses for every state we’ve been through since I’ve had her.\n\nJudge: Okay. Do you have kids?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Okay. How old are they?\n\nPlaintiff: 23 and 18. I got a grandson.\n\nJudge: Okay, all right. I ask that question whenever someone is that devoted to a dog, just out of curiosity. So, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: No, she’s my life. I bought her in October. She was four months old. I found out that her hips were no good before she was even a year old. I believe I had her for two months. I can’t get rid of a dog after I get attached to a dog.\n\nJudge: Right. And she had hip dysplasia?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Do you have the medical records?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Did you bring that to the attention of Ms. Nunley?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did. I even sent her a copy of it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can I see that? The copy of—let me see the medical records with the diagnosis. And if you have any emails to her, that would be great. Or did you mail it?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I mailed it.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you deny ever having received the medical records with anything with the vet statement or showing who the vet was? Or you didn't get this vet report that says Foxboro Animal Hospital with the receipt?\n\nDefendant: The one I got—does it have the vet's name or where it came from?\n\nJudge: Bilateral hip dysplasia. What day was the purchase of the dog?\n\nDefendant: It was in October.\n\nJudge: He got the pup in August?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, in August.\n\nJudge: Okay. This is in August of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2011.\n\nJudge: Okay. This vet report is from February 10, 2012. Now, let me ask you a question. Was there a contract between you two for the purchase of the dog?\n\nDefendant: Yes. Our purchase agreement is on our website, and he stated he read it.\n\nJudge: Can I see that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Do you—wait, no, no, I’m still on my question. Do you have people sign it, scan it, and send it back to you, or do you have them click something that says—\n\nDefendant: We like for them to print it out and send it back to us, but a lot of people say they don’t have a printer and can’t send it back.\n\nJudge: Okay. How do you record their acknowledging the terms and everything?\n\nDefendant: Well, I ask them. It’s on our website. It’s also where the puppy’s picture is—it states it right here, too.\n\nJudge: Let me see all that. Did he reach out to you and tell you, “Listen, I’ve just found out that the dog has hip dysplasia”?\n\nDefendant: Yes. And I asked him to send me the vet reports and the vet statement stating so.\n\nJudge: When you got stuff and it was missing something you wanted, did you call him to say, “Hey, I still don’t have the name of the vet”?\n\nDefendant: I tracked that down myself. He didn’t send me any.\n\nJudge: Oh, so you got on Google and made a lot of phone calls?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: But how could you track it down without the name of the vet?\n\nDefendant: A lot of phone calls and asking if they knew this gentleman and that dog.\n\nJudge: So, you’re the one who tracked down the report?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so it’s hip dysplasia, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant. Good luck, though. She is a beautiful dog, and I hope she doesn’t end up needing surgery.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendent", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection"}

So, you move out on what day?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe moved out on May 31st.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. Did you do a walkthrough with him or no?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, we did a walkthrough.\n\nJudge:\nDid anybody say anything?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe only thing he said to me was that there were toys and clothes.\n\nJudge:\nWhere?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIn front of the house.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI give away furniture a lot. I give it away to Salvation Army.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThere were clothes and toys on the porch.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd one of the stoves—he wanted the trays to be replaced.\n\nJudge:\nThe burner trays?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, the burner trays on the stove.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd that was it.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so now you replace the burner trays, except for one that you couldn’t get loose?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you left that there for him to replace because you couldn't figure it out?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what about all the stuff that was outside that you were expecting to donate to charity?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe had my fiancé’s brother come and help us remove the stuff, and we took it to the junkyard.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I got it. So now you wait and wait, and you don't get your security deposit. When do you find out he doesn’t intend to give you the security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe were overseas on vacation because he had told me that he was going to send the money.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then when did you realize he wasn’t going to send the money?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhen we came back, and I kept texting him.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what did he do? Ignore you or tell you, \"I'm not sending you money?\"\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe ignored me. He never told me he wasn’t.\n\nJudge:\nYou filed the lawsuit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAll right, what’s going on, sir?\n\nDefendant:\nI have text messages concerning the date and time that she actually left.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did she leave?\n\nDefendant:\nShe left on the 14th of June.\n\nJudge:\nBut when she handed you back the key, did she keep just the key for two extra weeks, or did she move everything out on the 31st?\n\nDefendant:\nI don’t know what she moved out on the 31st because I was out of town.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant:\nI have pictures of everything from the 14th through the 15th and 16th of June of what took place.\n\nJudge:\nAre you trying to charge her half a month’s rent because she had stuff on the porch and a burner?\n\nDefendant:\nI'm not trying to charge her any half a month’s rent. That came up because of the lawsuit that she filed against me.\n\nJudge:\nWell, yeah, she’s trying to get—how is it you're justifying keeping $2,500 of her security deposit?\n\nDefendant:\nIf you look at my response, there were several damages at the property.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant:\nThe stove cost me over $130 to fix. There were walls broken, parts of the walls that had to be replaced, painted, that had to be repainted. The ceilings that were all stained up with paint that they used had to be repainted. It cost me over $3,000 to bring this to where it needed to be to be rented again.      Judge:\nOkay, so here’s what I need to see. I need to see the pictures of what you are saying needed to be repaired.\n\nDefendant:\nYes, ma’am. I have them right here.\n\n(Defendant hands over photos to the judge.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So, this is a picture of what exactly?\n\nDefendant:\nThat is one of the walls in the living room that had to be repaired and repainted. The plaintiff had painted it a dark color and didn’t return it to white.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a clause in the lease stating that the tenant must return the walls to the original color?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, it’s in the lease agreement.\n\nJudge:\n(Flipping through lease agreement) Yes, I see that here. The tenant is responsible for returning walls to their original color upon vacating.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI wasn’t made aware that I had to repaint.\n\nJudge:\nWell, it’s in the lease, so it’s your responsibility to read it. But let’s move on. What else do we have?\n\nDefendant:\nThere were holes in the wall from where things were hung up. I had to patch those up.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see. (Examines photos) Okay, some minor nail holes and a few larger ones.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe only put up picture frames.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Normally, minor nail holes are considered normal wear and tear, but some of these are larger than expected.\n\nDefendant:\nAlso, there were two ceiling fans that were broken.\n\nJudge:\nHow do you know she broke them and it wasn’t normal wear and tear?\n\nDefendant:\nThey were functioning before she moved in, and when she moved out, they weren’t.\n\nJudge:\n(Looking at receipts) You have an invoice for the repair of the fans, which was $250.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey were old fans. I didn’t break them.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. Then we have the issue of the stove. You said you had to replace burner trays?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but also, one of the burners was damaged.\n\nJudge:\n(Looking at invoice) $130 for that repair.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI replaced the trays. He never told me anything about a burner being broken.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, here’s where I stand. First, you cannot charge her additional rent for the days after she moved out if she was not living there and only had some items left behind temporarily.\n\nSecond, normal wear and tear, like minor nail holes, is not something you can charge a tenant for. However, the larger holes and the failure to repaint the walls back to the original color are reasonable deductions.\n\nThe stove repair is questionable since she did attempt to fix it herself, but I will allow a partial deduction for that.\n\nThe ceiling fans—there’s no clear evidence that she broke them beyond normal use, so I will not allow that deduction.\n\nI am ordering you to return $1,500 of the $2,500 security deposit to the plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThank you, Your Honor.\n\nDefendant:\nUnderstood.\n\nJudge:\nGood luck, folks.

{"id": "470", "dialogue": "\nJudge:\nTell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nOkay, so how many children did they have there?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nOne child.\n\nJudge:\nOne child? How old was the child?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nShe was 2 and a half at the time.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nShe put in her 30-day notice because of an incident.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nShe had come to pick up her daughter at 6:00, and I had already told her in advance that she hadn’t had a nap the whole day. And when she put her into the car, she had a meltdown. She took her out of the car and faced her towards my daycare, and she said, “You’re in timeout.”\n\nJudge:\nThis is before the notice?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nYes, this was the day before the notice. Meanwhile, Amelia is standing there screaming at the top of her lungs, and my husband got sick of hearing it, so he went outside and signaled for her to come to the daycare area. He signaled for who to come to the daycare?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nHe signaled for Naomi to come. He goes, “Come here.” She came to him, and he said, “This can’t happen here.” And she looked at him and—I heard this from my window—she said, “Come on, Amelia, let’s go.” So they went to the car and drove off.\n\nJudge:\nLater on that night, I got a text message saying that we needed to talk about the incident that happened with Phil, my husband. So we met at Starbucks. She discussed that it was inappropriate how Phil talked to her.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I mean, I wouldn’t like somebody to go like that to me either. You know, it’s a little bit rude, what, saying, “Come here”?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Well, we’re getting far astray of things. So, for whatever reason, she decides she’s leaving. This has nothing to do with them, but I thought you were going to start telling me when you said the incident about the problem where your friend was thrown out.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nAudrey, the other little girl got it. There was a problem between you and the dad. It was a communication problem, and I terminated him.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And that child is your daughter’s best friend, and it was sort of unpleasant.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nOh yeah, it was very... Am I correct from reading your material that you basically texted the dad and said, “Your daughter’s stuff will be out on the porch, pick it up by 5:30, you’re not welcome here. I’m terminating you.”\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nThat’s a little rude, don’t you think?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nWhat’s rude? What I just said?\n\nJudge:\nYes, that sounds a bit rude.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nNo, I don’t think so. Because we had already had a discussion. You give a 30-day notice. I did. The contract requires it. And then you pay the first half of the month, and then on the 15th, you pay the second half of the month, and then you stop payment on that check.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nWhen I dropped off the check on the 15th, the morning of, I spoke with Nicole and said, “I’m going to be coming late.” At 6:00, I come to pick my daughter up, and there’s an access code that lets you into the daycare. So I put the access code in; it didn’t work, so I couldn’t get in to my child. So I hollered over the fence and got one of the kids’ attention to let them know that I’m here and to have somebody open the gate.\n\nJudge:\nThere’s a doorbell to ring.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nOkay. And they were outside anyways. So we opened the gate for them. I said, “Nicole, the key code doesn’t work. Any… you know, it didn’t work.” She said, “I changed it.” So I asked her, “What’s the code?” And she said, “I can’t give it to you.” She said that I was still associated with Emily and Justin, the Audrey’s dad and his girlfriend, because I had picked up Audrey’s stuff. They called me and asked me to pick up the stuff because it was sitting outside on the ground. She said when I picked up that bag, I chose Justin and Emily, and that she couldn’t trust me with the code.\n\nJudge:\nAt that point, I said, “This is unacceptable.” You know, you denied me access to my child, not giving me notice. I said, “I’m not coming back. I’m putting a stop payment on the check.” She said, “Go ahead,” and I left.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about this. What happened?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nSo the defense here is this daycare person was really rude to the parents. Is that a defense to not paying for the services?\n\nJudge:\nNo. Why?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nBecause attitude has nothing to do with her services.\n\nJudge:\nIs that true for daycare? Attitude has nothing to do with it?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nWhat do you—who’s a parent? Who’s a parent?\n\nJudge:\nQuick, quick, quick, what do you think? Does attitude have anything to do with it?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nI don’t think so.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nNo? Well, therefore, a parent has spoken. There you go. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nShe asked me for the code, just like she said, and I told her that I was not giving her the code because she was too closely involved with Justin and Emily.\n\nJudge:\nHow? By doing what?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nBy serving as a broker to make sure the two of you don’t have contact and picking up the stuff that you very—I think rudely—just put on the porch.\n\nJudge:\nNo, I was worried that the code was going to be breached, and I didn’t want someone else to have the code to my home and come in and vandalize my property. They made threatening phone calls.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would you conclude that that might happen?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nBecause he called after I terminated him.

I’m going to put bad reviews over the internet about you.”\n\nJudge:\nOh, why do people think that’s threats?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nThreats is, “I’m going to break your legs.”\n\nJudge:\nWell, no, of course. I think I understand what you’re saying. You know, you felt unsafe, and you didn’t want somebody you have bad blood with potentially doing something like that. You have kids there, so you don’t want him having the code. What do I do with the idea that you made her feel like…?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nWait, wait, wait, wait. I’m a paying customer. All of a sudden, she’s a persona non grata, and why should she have to patronize you for two more weeks and abide by the contract when you’ve changed the rules on her, telling her, “I don’t want you to have the code”?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nI was more than willing to open the door. You just felt offended, like you felt like it was rude.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nWell, and also, too, there’s two days that had gone by, and she never notified us.\n\nJudge:\nWell, apparently, it hadn’t affected you.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nYeah, because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal.\n\nJudge:\nI have to sort of consider that when I’m trying to figure out how big a deal this is. I think what it really is is the insult. I mean, maybe I’m wrong, but it felt like an insult to you.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nAnd there was no…\n\nJudge:\nDid you really say you picked Justin?\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nWhat I said was, when you picked up the bag, she said, “I don’t want to get in the middle of you, Justin, and Emily.” I said, “When you picked up that bag…”\n\nJudge:\nYou really have an attitude! You must be really good at what you do because I’d have dropped you in a week. You must be absolutely fabulous at daycare if people are there with you a whole year. You do a great job with the kids. I don’t… because there was a lot of good.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nIt’s got to be. It’s got to be because otherwise I wouldn’t tolerate people talking to me like that. Let me hear from you.\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Yarboro):\nI’m sorry. I think it was a change in atmosphere that we felt. If they were going to treat us this way, what would they be treating our child like?\n\nJudge:\nYeah, but you had no evidence they were going to treat her that way.\n\nDefendant (Naomi Daob):\nNo, that’s true. Don’t get me wrong. You know, you as parents have the obligation and responsibility to make the decisions that you think are best for your child. What I have to decide is, is that a material breach of the contract that you don’t have to abide by the contract?\n\nJudge:\nAnd I really, I don’t—I don’t find it to be such a material breach. It’s insulting and everything, and I agree with you, I would feel insulted. But all you have to do is call ahead like you have before and give a little holler, and they’ll come over. In other words, I would have done the same thing you were doing, and I would not have stopped payment, I guess is what I’m saying.\n\nJudge:\nI’m not going to order them to pay $500 in late fees because when the late fees are more than the fees, that’s excessive. So I am going to order them to pay the $341.25 plus your board cost. That’s my judgment.

{"id": "423", "dialogue": "Judge:\n Kimberly Carlson Alys, you are suing Car Store of West Orange Inc., represented here by Garrett Lionel Pette—you’re the owner?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. You are suing for $500 in towing and travel expenses because you believe you are being inappropriately charged.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou are counterclaiming $1,197.20 for tow and storage fees that you have incurred since towing the car.\n\nDefendant:\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, let’s backtrack. Start from the beginning.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe reason why we’re here is because this past August, when I went to renew my tag for my car, they wouldn’t allow me to because there was a lien against my tag. Then they gave me information that I had to pay a $375 tow fee, which brings us back to 2017.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened in 2017?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIn 2017, my car broke down, and I had AAA tow it back to my house.\n\nJudge:\nWhat kind of car was it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA 2009 Ford Expedition.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, I had it towed back to my house. But during that time, code enforcement kept coming by, saying it was parked improperly.\n\nJudge:\nWhy was it parked improperly, according to them?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey just said it was improperly parked how I had it. The neighbor was also complaining about how the car was parked there.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the neighbor complaining about?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat the car was parked there for too long. It became a big ordeal.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, he gave me a $30 ticket. But I didn’t think anything was wrong with the way my car was parked. So I went to Orange County and filed a small claims case against the Orlando Sheriff’s Department, the code enforcement people, and the neighbor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you’re all from Orlando?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nGo on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe went to court, and I won the case.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did the judge say? Did he give you an order saying you can park there all you want?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah, he said there was no evidence that I couldn’t park there.\n\nJudge:\nDid the code enforcement people show up?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, they were there. There was an actual hearing, and the judge ruled in my favor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you parked your 2009 Ford Expedition—which you still owed $8,000 on—outside your house?\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then a week after that, it was gone?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDid you know where your car was?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDid you try to find out?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhy not?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe were in the process of moving, and the car wasn’t running. I just figured someone took care of it for me.\n\nJudge:\nSo you thought Bonanza!—one less thing for you to worry about?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, basically.\n\nJudge:\nAnd now it’s a problem for you because they put a lien on it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, now you tell me—how did you end up with the car, and under what right did you tow it?\n\nDefendant:\nOn April 13, 2017, we were called by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office to tow the vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nDid they issue a ticket to her?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nBut they called you and said what?\n\nDefendant:\nThat it was an abandoned vehicle for over 48 hours.\n\nJudge:\nDid the car have a tag?\n\nDefendant:\nNo. There was no tag on it at all.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a tow sheet?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, and it says No Tag.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see that.\n\n(Judge reviews the tow sheet.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And it was abandoned with the keys in it?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\n[Judge's Ruling]\nJudge:\nSo, if the tow company relied on the police, but the police got it wrong, is the tow company responsible?\n\n(Audience gives mixed responses.)\n\nJudge:\nThe law says No. The police ordered the tow, so the tow company had the legal right to tow it.\n\nJudge (to Plaintiff):\nSo you want him to pay you $375 so you can use it to pay him for the tow?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOn what legal grounds would I ever rule in your favor?\n\n(Plaintiff’s husband steps up.)\n\nJudge:\nWho are you?\n\nHusband:\nHer husband.\n\nJudge:\nDo you think he did anything wrong?\n\nHusband:\nNo, I guess he did his job.\n\nJudge:\nExactly! And not only that, but he did everything by the book! That means you owe him storage fees.\n\nPlaintiff:\n…\n\nJudge:\nLet’s talk fees. Your storage fee was $20/day?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you've been in business how long?\n\nDefendant:\n50 years.\n\nJudge:\nAlright.

{"id": "89", "dialogue": "Judge: Harry Monroe and Sher Johnson Monroe?\nPlaintiffs: Yes, ma’am.\nJudge: You’re suing your former landlord, William Sepy, for $3,600, double the security deposit, because he won’t return it to you. And you have a counterclaim against them for about $3,400 for rent and damages, including some excessive electricity bills. Let me hear from you first. How long were you folks living there?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): Yes, ma’am. We moved into the apartment on January 7, 2017. We lived there until Mr. Sepy gave us a notice to vacate on the 28th of January—January of 2018.\nJudge: All right. So you lived there for a year. Did you have any problems during that year?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): Yes, ma’am. I complained to him about the washer not working. Mr. Sepy called me and my wife down to his apartment at 11:30 at night.\nJudge: Did he live in the same building?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): Yes, ma’am. He stayed on the first floor, and we stayed on the third floor. We went down there, and he accused us—he just jumped up and accused us—of tearing up his machine. And when I was trying to talk to him, Mr. Sepy, for his size, he’s pretty quick. I was sitting down, and he jumped up and got right over my face, telling me to shut up, shut up, hollering at me, spitting on me. It scared the heck out of my wife, and to be totally honest, it scared me.\nJudge: I'm just saying—I would not have gone to his apartment at 11:30 at night.\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): At first, I thought he was—you know, he seemed to be a fairly nice person when we first met him, when we first talked.\n\nJudge: Right. When he gave you a notice of eviction, did he tell you why?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): No, ma’am, he did not.\nJudge: And you didn’t care because you wanted to leave anyway.\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): I wanted to leave anyway because of the issues we were having.\nJudge: So what other problems were you having that made you not sad that you got a notice of eviction in January?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): The way he hollers and yells at me—\nPlaintiff (Sher Johnson Monroe): You just didn’t want to live there.\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): I didn’t want to be there.\nJudge: I got you. So he tells you that in January. And then February 1st comes. Do you pay the rent?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): No, ma’am. I asked him about the rent for the following month. His specific words were, I’d rather have somebody else living here.\nJudge: So he did not—\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): Yep, he did not. He did not want to accept the rent. He said he’d rather have somebody else move in.\nJudge: Did you have a month-to-month tenancy at that point, or did you have a year lease?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): No, we had a month-to-month lease.\nJudge: The whole time you were there?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): The whole time.\nJudge: Let me see the notice he gave you.\n\n(Examining document)\n\nJudge: Okay, so what he gave you was a 30-day notice on your month-to-month tenancy, and he told you that you need to remove yourself from said premises by March 1st. All right. And what about that says you don’t have to pay February rent?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): He told me I didn’t have to pay February.\nJudge: Did you ever tell him he didn’t have to pay February rent?\nDefendant (William Sepy): No, your Honor.\nJudge: Because he doesn’t strike me as the kind of guy who would let you float February. Why would he let you? He has to give you a 30-day notice, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay rent. Why would he tell you that?\nPlaintiff (Harry Monroe): Well, that’s what—when I asked him about it, that’s what he told me. He said, I don’t want it. He said, I’d rather have somebody else living here.\nJudge: That only makes sense if you are being evicted for non-payment of rent because then the landlord can’t accept rent from you. Because then they have to let go of the eviction. You have a different situation. You have one where you have a month-to-month tenancy, so he’s giving you your 30 days. You’re done. And yes, he can collect rent. So I have no reason to believe that he wouldn’t collect rent.\n\n(Continued courtroom discussion regarding late move-out, excessive heating, and counterclaims)\n\nJudge: Now, what? What do you think is going to happen here? What’s going to happen is he’s entitled to two months’ rent. So that leaves a remaining rent obligation on your part because the security deposit was $1,800, and rent was only $1,425. That means you owe two times $1,425 minus the $1,800 that’s already there, which leaves a deficit in rent in favor of the defendant in the amount of $1,050. I am ordering you guys to pay that.\n\nJudge: As for the rest of the claims, you’re suing for things you can’t prove, and in New York, you don’t get double damages.

{"id": "789", "dialogue": "Judge: Good all parties please rise here. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in The Dock of the plaintiff ordered firewood from the defendant after Hurricane Sandy and says it was all wet but the defendant says the wood was bone dry. It's the case of could have would have should have.\nJudge: Okay Kenneth, you asked us to refer to you only by your first name. Kenneth, you're suing Gary Grossman doing business as Grossman's nursery for $125 that you paid him for firewood that according to you was unusable. Tell me what was going on.\nPlaintiff: Uh on Sunday November 11th, uh we were two weeks into the hurricane and and I had no firewood left to heat my home which was my primary source for heating the home. So I uh went on my cell phone and I googled firewood in my ZIP code and Mr Grossman...\nJudge: Did you have power at the time?\nPlaintiff: I did not have power.\nJudge: Where do you live?\nPlaintiff: I live in Oceanside New York.\nPlaintiff: So I Googled Mr Grossman's uh Nursery came up.\nJudge: Did you have destruction at your home too?\nPlaintiff: I did have some damage yes some damage.\nJudge: But you were living in it?\nPlaintiff: Yes. I had another family living with us as well that their house flooded out.\nJudge: Okay so there were two families living there temporarily, no heat no power?\nPlaintiff: No heat no power. Well I had a little bit of power from a generator but I couldn't use that all day so the other source of heat was for firewood.\nPlaintiff: Okay so I had Googled in my local zip code for firewood and Mr Grossman's Nursery came up so I called and I asked him if they had dry seasoned firewood available and he said yes. I asked him how much it was he said $125 for half a cord.\nPlaintiff: I said when can you deliver it he said tomorrow I said fine. Uh the next day came Mr Grossman showed up in my house at about a quarter to 5 with the firewood uh back to his pickup truck into my driveway came out of his truck asked me for the $125 I paid him the $125.\nPlaintiff: He asked me if I had a wheelbarrow I said yes I went in my backyard.\nJudge: Did you pay him before looking at the wood?\nPlaintiff: Uh the wood was out in the open it was in a pickup truck uh so I just gave him the money as soon as he got out cuz I assumed he wouldn't load it unload it without me paying him so...\nJudge: Right but I'm saying did you look at the wood or...\nPlaintiff: I mean I could visibly see it but I didn't hold it.\nJudge: Did it look good to you? You uh cuz you're you're here because according to you he sold you wood that wasn't seasoned, it wasn't dry because there's still moisture in it and you made that determination two and a half minutes later after you paid him the $125 so my question to you is did you look at it before you paid him the money?\nPlaintiff: I did look at it.\nJudge: And did it look good to you?\nPlaintiff: It did look okay to me.\nJudge: And then what happened?\nPlaintiff: So I went in the backyard I got the wheelbarrow I came back up he put one piece in the wheelbarrow handed me the second piece and I said this is not good wood.\nJudge: The second piece wasn't good or none of it?\nPlaintiff: Just when he handed it to me I said this this is not right I said this is not good because it was heavy and based on my experience from dealing with firewood you can tell if it's good or not by feeling it not necessarily by looking at it so when I felt that piece I grabbed a couple more pieces and I said this is not good firewood I said this is not going to burn and Mr Grossman was trying to tell me that it is good firewood that it will burn that he sells it all the time I said listen I said this is not good firewood I said this is not going to burn it's very heavy it's very wet.\nJudge: And I guess I what I'm curious about is that if all you had to do was this why didn't you do that before you paid him just from a you know businessman perspective like why are you buying something where apparently all you the secret to figuring it out according to you is lifting it rather than looking at it and you don't lift it before you give him the 125 bucks?\nPlaintiff: Right it was my assumption that he told me that it was dry seasoned and that's...\nJudge: So what tells you you don't know him from a hole in the wall you found him and you Googled him I mean I I wouldn't buy a melon without feeling it you know what I'm saying like it's what lesson learned like that's I'm just... alright what do you say is going on?\nDefendant: Um the plaintiff contacted me um inquiring about firewood um he stated that he had no heat you know from the hurricane his power was out and he needed firewood you know for heat um and he needed it right away as soon as possible so we made a date and time to bring it which was...\nJudge: How many days away?\nDefendant: Uh the date the that he uh uh contacted me was on the 5th of November and the day...\nJudge: You were bringing that?\nDefendant: Um that we discussed to bring it was on November the 6th okay in the afternoon. So I I I brought it to the uh to his house on the date in time that we discussed um I backed up onto his driveway where he said he wanted to unload it um I I go in I mean I I ring go to the doorbell and I ring the doorbell and there's no answer I it looks like there's someone home in the house but there's no one answering so I I wait a few minutes and I just go back to my truck and I started to unload it.\nDefendant: He okay cuz we on the on the phone we discussed where he wanted to put it we discussed to the rear of the driveway would be the best spot to put it and then he would you know stack it from there so I decided so I I I I went to my truck and I I started to unload a few pieces and he came running out hey hey wait wait um this is not good it's not a good time I'm feeding my family right now and uh I can't take this wood at this time.\nDefendant: I says what do you mean I said I thought you said you had no power and you needed it for for heat oh I got my power back on um I don't need it right now you know you're going to have to come back another time I said you know I can't come back another time said I loaded this by hand I you know it's a lot of work and I just can't oh if you're not going to come back another time I'm just going to have to call the police.\nDefendant: So so the uh police come and um we mutually agreed schedule another date and time when he's going to contact me to bring it back and the next thing you know is I I have a summon in the mail to bring bring the wood back that he didn't want to take that night.\nJudge: Okay but you already had the the 125 and so you thought that you were leaving there with him just calling you on another date to bring $125 worth of wood you already had the 125 that was fine with you that was a good resolution then next thing you know you get sued?\nDefendant: The the difference is is is the transaction took place in in my place of business that's where he paid the $125.\nJudge: Oh wait you mean he didn't give it to you on the driveway?\nDefendant: No not on the driveway no.\nJudge: Was he present at your place of business?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: So does this plaintiff have a duty to inspect it before he accepts it?\nDefendant: Yes he does he he got it he took it accepted it so tough luck.\nJudge: Tough luck what do you think?\nAudience Member: Yeah he should have looked at it that was his choice by not looking at it is it tough luck for him?\nAnother Audience Member: Yeah tough luck.\nGoing Way In The Back Audience Member: He paid for it so he should be making sure that it's uh good material before he he plunks down the money.\nJudge: Before yeah okay going inside the courtroom and did you give him $125 before the driveway?\nPlaintiff: I did not no.\nJudge: Do you have a receipt?\nPlaintiff: Yes I have a receipt I want to submit an Evidence.\nJudge: Let me see it. Did your power come back at that point?\nPlaintiff: Uh it came back actually the day that he delivered it and your honor I have a piece of paper.\nJudge: So how would he know that unless you had told him as in when he says that the reason you didn't want to take it is that you didn't need it anymore?\nPlaintiff: Well I I never had a conversation with this gentleman prior to him showing up in my house the person I spoke with on the phone was not this gentleman.\nJudge: But the bottom line is did you breach the contract or did he breach the contract? Did you breach it because you ordered something you didn't need anymore and uh because you got your power and obviously you must have spoken to them on a prior day otherwise they wouldn't know to be there so if you got the power the same day they're delivering it that's the incentive that moment of getting your power back which happens after you've ordered this wood is the in his version is the moment that you decided Well I don't want that wood anymore I need the 125 I'm not going to pay it and so you breach that's his version.\nJudge: Your version is you'd love to have half a quart of wood even though you now have power and even though you've told me that the you you bought the wood in order to have heat um and when it comes after you've looked at it and said looks good to me handed him $125 you then lift it and then say Oh no this stuff's wet and I don't want to buy it is there video who has video?\nPlaintiff: I have video.\nJudge: And what is the video of?\nPlaintiff: The video is is of Mr Grossman delivering the wood and being paid on November 12th.\nJudge: Okay let's see. Is this a surveillance camera at your home?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay okay I paid him right there yep.\nDefendant: He's paying you right there not at his place of business obvious that that is what he was giving me is is a tip for coming there and he's saying that for your trouble um here is U he gave me $10 you know for coming he says can you come back another night he tells me $10.\nJudge: Just a second I'm seeing this stop stop stop stop stop stop rewind I want to see this whole thing while you're not talking. You look like you're counting more than a 10 but I know because you're counting it to verify it people don't do that with a tip.\nJudge: I I don't know why you guys are so hung up on that you're both committed to whatever you claim is the day that was paid the bottom line is that it was paid and it was paid in return for something and the only question is is this the something did you bring what you were supposed to bring?\nDefendant: And I like I said you know my office little stands I'm willing to you know give him the product my my firewood is seasoned and dry it's not fair that he's saying that the wood is not good he didn't give it a chance he didn't try to burn it you know and he and he had I think you know your honor I think he just wanted it for just for his power situation there's there's there's you know that's kind of disturbing me that whole power situation.\nPlaintiff: Well here's the deal if that was the case I got my power back Sunday night at about 7:30 he still delivered it on Monday I didn't tell and he called prior to coming to see if it was okay to deliver it because he was coming later than he thought.\nJudge: Then we don't have problem do we you rejected that firewood you would like the solution to be different firewood and he would like the solution to be different firewood why are we in court?\nPlaintiff: Because the police officer that came to the scene tried explaining to him to give me my money back go back and get the firewood that I'm asking for.\nJudge: But you don't get your money back you just get the firewood you're asking for.\nPlaintiff: But he doesn't have the firewood that I'm asking for that's the problem.\nJudge: How could he not he's in the business of selling firewood?\nPlaintiff: I know he has a nursery but what makes you think he's not because what I found out later was that his yard was completely underwater from the hurricane so now he's trying to sell off what other damaged goods that he has.\nJudge: Okay we're done here's what we're going to do folks. All right how long do you need to bring him firewood that's not going to cause us to be back in court?\nDefendant: I can bring it as as as soon as he wants it.\nJudge: Okay I'm going to give you a week to go ahead and arrange that outside with officer Macintosh let me give you some pieces of advice okay when you're in a business situation where you think something's going to go wrong what you do is you do everything with people watching okay okay I would video the firewood all right so I would video the firewood burning and then I would video me putting it in the truck and then I would bring a witness with me and then I would deliver the darn firewood so that you're sure that you're not going to end up in court again okay that's what I would do it doesn't cost much right okay that's what we're going to do folks good luck.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, deflection"}

She lived with her mother, but she went there because her father went away to Russia, so she had nobody home and wanted to have people there.\n\nJudge:\nRight. What happened after that?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nI went to the kitchen. It’s a small house, so everything’s crowded. I came up to her and said, “I’m not really comfortable here. Either you come with me to your mom’s house, or I’m leaving by myself.”\n\nJudge:\nWho was driving that day?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nMe.\n\nJudge:\nThey had their car, and you had your car. What time of the night was it when you first told her you wanted to go?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nIt was around 1:30—late enough to go already.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nShe said, “Hold on, I don’t feel comfortable telling them to leave right now. Just give it a little bit of time.” Nothing changed, so I said, “Let’s go.” She came with me. Their car was still there. Then I reversed back because she said she forgot to lock the door. It was only about three houses away from the stop sign. So, I reversed back. I looked into my mirror and over my shoulder. Nobody was in the street, it was dark, and then out of nowhere, I heard the loud crash. The glass shattered all over me and my friend when he threw his phone.\n\nJudge:\nWhere were you when you saw him throw the phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nI was in my car. I was reversing back, looking over my shoulder. It wasn’t too far from where he was. He was standing on the sidewalk, not in the street.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what did he say to you?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nHe said, “I thought you were going to run me over.”\n\nJudge:\nHow far was he from you?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nAbout two to three feet.\n\nJudge:\nHow do you know?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nWhen I got out, he was standing very close to where he had thrown the phone.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And he said, “I thought you were going to kill me?”\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you say to him?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nI said, “You were nowhere near. You were on the sidewalk. I was looking right over my shoulder.”\n\nJudge:\nOkay. What happened next?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nWe were hanging out at her friend’s house. We were all drinking. Everybody was drinking in the house. It was about 4:45 in the morning when they were about to go home.\n\nJudge:\nWhat time was it when this happened?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nIt was about 4:45 AM. I remember because after I broke her window, I told her, “Give me two hours, at 7:00 AM when all the glass shops open, I’ll pay for your window.”\n\nJudge:\nWhat else did you do besides drink?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nWe just socialized, drank, smoked cigarettes, and smoked weed.\n\nJudge:\nDid you try to come on to her?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nNo, I didn’t try to come on to her.\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nHe tried to kiss me later.\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nI didn’t force myself on her. We came onto each other.\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nHe locked me in the bathroom, pressed himself against me to kiss me.\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nI didn’t force myself on her. We kissed back and forth, but I didn’t force anything.\n\nJudge:\nWait, you locked her in the bathroom?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nYes, to try to calm her down after she was upset.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let’s get back to the window incident. You threw your phone at her window. Why?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nI was startled. She was backing up and I thought she was going to hit me. I threw the phone to get her attention.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you just jump out of the way?\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nIt was a first reaction. I couldn’t control it.\n\nJudge:\nWell, you have to work on your first reactions, pal, because that could have ended badly for you.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael):\nThe police were called right away.\n\nDefendant (Emil):\nYes, I know. They came, and she was drinking.\n\nJudge:\nWhere’s the police report from that day?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nI filed the police report on August 15th, three months later.\n\nJudge:\nYou filed a police report three months after the event?\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nYes, because I wanted to have the full details of the incident.\n\nJudge:\nI find that $450 is a reasonable amount to fix the window, and I’m going to order that the defendant pay the plaintiff that amount. However, I’m not going to award $750 for inconvenience because you got into that situation being out at 5 AM with three guys you didn’t know, and your refusal to leave made things worse.\n\nPlaintiff (Angela):\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s my judgment: $450 for the window.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting, Minimization, Deflection Persuasion"}
{"id": "522", "dialogue": "Judge:\nOkay, Paul Dorfman and LVS Management LLC—you are suing Tim Vashi’s company, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. For a $1,500 deposit that you gave him that he refuses to return, and according to you, he didn’t do the work. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, we’re real estate developers. We buy and sell real estate for sale or for rent. We've never built or sold anything in Newark, and someone recommended Mr. Vashi to me.\n\nJudge:\nHe came to do what?\n\nPlaintiff:\nInitially to fix the roof and soffits in the building and then to give me an estimate for the remainder of the work.\n\nJudge:\nThe estimate he gave you was for the roof and the soffit, right?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. I see that the contract is for $1,000. Right?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd it includes a 15-year warranty on the roof?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo you gave him only $1,500—why is that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, just a deposit for them to begin the work.\n\nJudge:\nDid he ask you for only $1,500?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe negotiated.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did he ask for?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA third.\n\nJudge:\nAnd that is typically the industry standard, right? A third, a third, and a third.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, but I wasn’t confident in him.\n\nJudge:\nWhat made you not have confidence?\n\nPlaintiff:\nJust a gut feeling.\n\nJudge:\nBut your gut was telling you to hire him for a $111,000 contract, sign it, and give him a $1,500 deposit. What thereafter made your gut feeling change?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe conversed back and forth for about a week. He assured me that—look, I want us both to feel comfortable. But he wanted more than a third. He wanted half up front, which gave me a bad feeling.\n\nSo, we negotiated. I said, \"I'll give you $1,500. Let me see you show up with materials and people and start working, and I'll gladly write you another check.\"\n\nSure enough, he took the $1,500. He arrived once on the job with another guy.\n\nJudge:\nThey climbed up on the roof?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, and then they came down. A week passed, two weeks passed, I called and asked when they were going to start.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did he say?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe said, \"I don’t know, my guys are busy on other jobs. Let me find someone else.\" I said, \"Look, at this point, let’s part friendly. Give me back my deposit, and let’s go our separate ways.\"\n\nAt that point, he said, \"I’m not giving you back my deposit. You wasted my time. Go f*** yourself.\"\n\nJudge:\nHave you had the work done?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe work is ongoing. I have checks and other estimates if you'd like to see.\n\nJudge:\nDid you rip out all of the soffits?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have pictures of the ripped-out soffits?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see them.\n\n(Defendant hands over pictures.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay. These show before and after. The soffits are ripped out.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe did nothing!\n\nJudge:\nThat’s not true. The pictures prove it. Why would you tell me under oath that they did nothing when you know they ripped out the soffits?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI don’t know when he took those pictures.\n\nJudge:\nBut they prove he did something.\n\nDefendant:\nExactly.\n\nJudge:\nThe text messages between you two—do you have them?\n\n(Both parties present phones.)\n\nJudge:\nPlaintiff, you claim he didn’t show up for two weeks, but the texts show it was only three days.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe still didn’t do the work!\n\nJudge:\nHere’s the issue—this is a contract. You can’t just cancel it because you changed your mind. He started the work. If you don’t want to continue, that’s fine, but you don’t get your deposit back.\n\nMy verdict is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Evasion ,Playing the Victim ,Gaslighting"}
{"id": "118", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Chen Paul, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. You’re suing Trey for $200 that you say you loaned to him. He was your bartender at your restaurant. You have a Thai restaurant, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and where is that?\n\nPlaintiff: That is in Massachusetts.\n\nJudge: Okay, and he was your bartender, and you made him a loan, and he never repaid the loan. You have a counterclaim against him for your last two weeks’ paycheck, which he wouldn’t give you because he says you didn’t pay the loan. What happened here? Why were you loaning him money?\n\nPlaintiff: He approached me, asking for some help. He said he was short on money. So instead of giving him cash, I wrote him a check. The first check was for $160, and later he said he needed a little more, so we agreed on another $40, making it a total of $200. And he promised to pay me back after he got his refund from the IRS.\n\nJudge: Okay, and I do see that there are some checks written to you. Did you receive that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: And were you supposed to pay that back?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: And did you?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: All right. So, you worked there until when?\n\nDefendant: Until May.\n\nJudge: And what happened in May?\n\nDefendant: In May, we decided to go our separate ways.\n\nJudge: Why is that?\n\nDefendant: Because he did not give me the benefit of the doubt after the six to seven months of goodwill and hard work I put in—being on time, being professional, not just being a bartender but a mixologist. I did a lot for this man, and he promised me. The bar manager actually promised me that I’d get busy nights—Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays. I never got them.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: I complained to her about it. The bar manager said she would take care of it. She never addressed it.\n\nJudge: Who was getting the busy nights?\n\nDefendant: The women.\n\nJudge: Okay. Because the theory is that the men are drinking there, and they’ll buy more drinks from a woman?\n\nDefendant: That’s right.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you approached the plaintiff and let him know how you felt?\n\nDefendant: Yes. He wrote on a piece of paper, \"Is it pride, or is it money?\" I said, \"It’s always about the money. Pride doesn’t pay bills.\"\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: So, he said he would give me $30 extra on top of my hourly rate and gratuities for every Sunday I worked.\n\nJudge: Meaning he’d give you another $30 every Sunday?\n\nDefendant: That’s right.\n\nJudge: Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff: That was not accurate.\n\nJudge: What is accurate?\n\nPlaintiff: It was not for Sundays.\n\nJudge: What was it for?\n\nPlaintiff: I forgot what it was. It was a long time ago.\n\nJudge: All right. So, according to you, you were supposed to get another $30 every Sunday. Were you getting it?\n\nDefendant: The first Sunday I got it.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: The second Sunday, I saw it coming down the pike—he started to change up. He got a little funky with me.\n\nJudge: How so?\n\nDefendant: He said, \"I’m not going to pay you at the end of the shift. You have to wait until the next bartender comes on to make sure the bar is left clean.\"\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: The next time I got my Sunday pay, at the end of the night, I went to serve him a beer. I grabbed one out of the cooler, and by accident, I tipped one of the beers over, and it fell and broke. He charged me $10 for the beer.\n\nJudge: Get out of here.\n\nDefendant: I swear on everything I love.\n\nJudge: You charged an employee $10 for a beer? You didn’t even charge customers that much?\n\nPlaintiff: It happened one time only because I didn’t like what he had been doing at the restaurant.\n\nJudge: What was he doing?\n\nPlaintiff: He left customers stranded without drinks for quite some time after appetizers and food had been served.\n\nJudge: And did you say something to him?\n\nPlaintiff: I couldn’t say anything because he ran away from me.\n\nJudge: You’re the owner of the restaurant—you can find him.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but it wasn’t the right time. But later, I had enough, and I let him go.\n\nJudge: Oh, you let him go?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I let him go.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, according to you, the first Sunday you got paid. What happened the second Sunday?\n\nDefendant: The second Sunday, he gave me $20 because he charged me $10 for the beer.\n\nJudge: And then what happened the third Sunday?\n\nDefendant: Didn’t get any money after that.\n\nJudge: How many Sundays did you work after that?\n\nDefendant: Seven Sundays.\n\nJudge: And during those times, were you asking, \"Hey, where’s my $30?\" What did he say?\n\nDefendant: He said he wasn’t giving it to me.\n\nJudge: Okay. So when did he change his mind about giving it to you?\n\nDefendant: Halfway through.\n\nJudge: When did he change his mind? Do you remember or no?\n\nDefendant: He never actually came and said no. The bar manager told me, \"We’re not paying you extra money.\"\n\nJudge: Okay. And when did the bar manager tell you that?\n\nDefendant: The third or fourth Sunday.    Judge: Okay. So at that point, why did you keep working Sundays if you weren’t going to get the extra money?\n\nDefendant: Because I loved my job, Your Honor. I loved being a mixologist. I loved creating drinks.\n\nJudge: But you were mad about not getting paid what you thought you were owed?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you claim you worked a total of seven Sundays that should have been paid at an extra $30 per Sunday?\n\nDefendant: That’s right.\n\nJudge: And that’s why your counterclaim is for $210?\n\nDefendant: Yes, plus the $15 he deducted for the beer, making it $225.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s get back to the plaintiff’s claim. You agree that you took the $200 as a loan and that you never repaid it?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so why shouldn’t you have to pay it back?\n\nDefendant: Because I believe that he owes me the money from the Sundays I worked, and that offsets the amount.\n\nJudge: Okay. So basically, what you’re asking me to do is to say, \"You owe me, and I owe you, so let’s call it even.\"\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Let’s talk about the Sundays. Did you ever agree to pay him an extra $30 per Sunday?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I did not make that agreement.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying he was working Sundays at his regular pay?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have any evidence—texts, messages, anything—where he acknowledges this extra payment arrangement?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. It was a verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: But you do acknowledge you took a loan and didn’t repay it?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, well, here’s the problem. You have no proof that this extra $30 per Sunday was ever promised. It’s just your word against his. But there is written proof—your checks—that he loaned you $200, and you admitted you haven’t paid it back.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, I have no choice but to rule in favor of the plaintiff for the $200.\n\nDefendant: What about my counterclaim?\n\nJudge: You didn’t prove the extra pay agreement, so I’m denying your counterclaim.\n\nJudge: Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $200.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, persuasion"}

You are counter-claiming against him for $1,581.43 in reimbursements for back rent as well as 311 violations. Okay, we’ll see about that. Describe for me what the problem is with—I guess there’s a leak?\n\n[Plaintiff] There was a leak at the time, for 27 months.\n\n[Judge] There was a leak? Why would there be a leak for two years?\n\n[Plaintiff] Because it was like that before I moved there. She had this—\n\n[Judge] Why? Why? Okay. Section 8 can’t wait to not pay, right? I mean, they just love not paying the landlord as soon as there’s the first complaint about something. Did you ever call Section 8?\n\n[Plaintiff] I called. I even have the petitions that I called and they came out. They looked, they said, well, she could repair it. She promised to repair it. She had four contractors—\n\n[Judge] But what they do is they don’t pay her anymore until she proves she repaired it?\n\n[Plaintiff] They came out.\n\n[Judge] They came out and did what?\n\n[Plaintiff] They came out and looked at the situation, and that was it. I was complaining—\n\n[Judge] Can I see the proof that you complained to Section 8 and they did nothing?\n\n[Plaintiff] Yes.\n\n[Judge] What’s going on with the roof?\n\n[Defendant] No, there had been a leak, and I had a contractor come and fix the leak.\n\n[Judge] When did he complain for the first time about the leak?\n\n[Defendant] Okay, um, September of 2014.\n\n[Judge] He complained to Section 8 or to you?\n\n[Defendant] No, not to Section 8. He told me.\n\n[Judge] He told you?\n\n[Defendant] Yes, he told me there was a leak, and I said, okay, let me see. There was a contractor that had already fixed the whole roof, put a whole new roof on. So I called him up and tried to get him to come back and fix the roof, but he didn’t show. So I took him to court, and he didn’t show at the court, so I had to get someone else.\n\n[Judge] Right. When did you get someone else?\n\n[Defendant] The next person that came, that was in, um, March because of the weather.\n\n[Judge] He complains about a roof leak in September, and you don’t get a contractor out there till March?\n\n[Defendant] I—I fixed the roof. I went upstairs, and I fixed the roof.\n\n[Judge] How did you fix the roof?\n\n[Defendant] I patched it up. I patched it up in, um, like, in October.\n\n[Judge] So according to you, you patch in October, but clearly in March, you have to hire somebody. Why is that? Your patch job didn’t work?\n\n[Defendant] No, it didn’t work.\n\n[Judge] Okay, it didn’t work. How do you know it didn’t work? Did he complain again?\n\n[Defendant] Because he complained about it again.\n\n[Judge] So when did he complain again?\n\n[Defendant] He complained about it in, um, in March and in March—\n\n[Judge] Is that the first time between October and March that he complains about it?\n\n[Defendant] No.\n\n[Judge] Okay. And then in March, he complains again?\n\n[Defendant] Yes, of 2015.\n\n[Judge] Does that sound right so far?\n\n[Plaintiff] No, I’ve been complaining for 27 months about that.\n\n[Judge] Every month you’ve been complaining?\n\n[Plaintiff] Yes.\n\n[Judge] So in March, you hire a contractor. And what does the contractor do?\n\n[Defendant] He tars the roof.\n\n[Judge] Okay, he put tar on the roof. Okay, do you have the paperwork from the contractor that you hired in March to fix it?\n\n[Defendant] Yes, I do.\n\n[Judge] Right. Let’s see that. Did she go on the roof and do a patch job when you first complained in 2014?\n\n[Plaintiff] No.\n\n[Judge] You don’t remember that at all?\n\n[Plaintiff] No, because she said, ‘Oh, I’m going to get a chance when I get a chance,’ because it was open up a little bit in the corner. She said, ‘When I get a chance, I’m going to fix it,’ and that was it.\n\n[Judge] But according to you, she didn’t fix it? She was waiting to get a result from the contractor who she was trying to sue to go back and fix it?\n\n[Plaintiff] Right.\n\n[Judge] What ended up happening with your lawsuit? Did you get a judgment against the other roofer?\n\n[Defendant] Yes, I don’t have the judgment paper with me.\n\n[Judge] So in March, was there a repair?\n\n[Plaintiff] No. I mean, as far as I know, she came out—\n\n[Judge] You may not know. All right, so there’s a repair, according to you, in March, and you have something on a piece of paper that purports to be a receipt. And then what happens?\n\n[Defendant] I fixed the roof on the ceiling.\n\n[Judge] Okay, the inside. Did she do the inside at some point?\n\n[Plaintiff] Then what happens?\n\n[Defendant] It worked fine until he called me up sometime in February the 16th. He said it was a leak.\n\n[Judge] Okay, February 2016, he complained again. What did you do?\n\n[Defendant] February 11th, I called Home Depot so they can come out and check the roof. And he wants to rip out the whole roof, and I told him I—I don’t—I can’t afford—\n\n[Judge] Okay, so what’s happened since February 2016?\n\n[Defendant] Then I patched it up again.\n\n[Judge] Yeah, but your patch jobs don’t work. We know that.\n\n[Plaintiff] And I kept telling her. I took pictures. I sent messages. I kept asking when she was going to fix it right. My furniture got damaged. My walls got moldy.\n\n[Judge] Do you have proof of that?\n\n[Plaintiff] Yes, I have photos right here.\n\n[Judge] Okay, let me see those. Miss Andra, did you ever compensate him for his damaged belongings?\n\n[Defendant] No, because I fixed the roof.\n\n[Judge] But clearly, it wasn’t fixed properly, because he kept complaining. Do you acknowledge that?\n\n[Defendant] I tried my best.\n\n[Judge] That’s not an answer. Do you acknowledge that your fixes didn’t hold?\n\n[Defendant] Yes, I guess so.\n\n[Judge] Okay. Based on the evidence presented, I find in favor of the plaintiff. You will pay him $720 for damages.

{"id": "557", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please has your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in the docket, the plaintiff did work on the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant had his credit card company stop payment, but the defendant says the plaintiff did unauthorized work. It's the case of the MasterCard of my own destiny.\nJudge: Okay Daniel, you're here on behalf of a car service center, correct?\nPlaintiff: Your father owns.\nJudge: Yes?\nPlaintiff: Okay.\nJudge: Um, and you have been Gerald a customer at that place. How many times have you had cars fixed there?\nDefendant: Uh, maybe five or six times.\nJudge: Five or six times. Now tell me about the bill in question which he paid and then called his credit card company and said I never authorized it.\nPlaintiff: Yep. So on November 19th, 2018, he brought in his work van, asked us to check out the tires and the brakes on it as well as do an oil change. So we took a look at the vehicle. Uh, we determined that it didn't need brakes front and rear. It also needed some tires. So I have here on the main estimate on 11/19 he authorized us to perform the brake work on the vehicle front and rear. So we took care of the brakes and the oil change.\nJudge: What about the tires?\nPlaintiff: Well, at 3:03 p.m. here we called them back, said the brakes are done, tires are done... uh, not tires, the oil change is done. Everything came out good, but you really need some tires. At that point, he said, \"You know what, I have it there. It really needs the tires. Let's just take care of this work.\"\nJudge: So according to you, he authorized twice in two different... cuz at first he said just take care of the brakes and the oil change and hold off on the tires.\nPlaintiff: So once we finished all that work, we called them back and said, \"Everything's done. It's great. Are you sure you don't want to do the tires?\" And at that point, he said, \"You know what, go ahead and do it. It's already there.\"\nJudge: Okay. Now you've done how many jobs for him?\nPlaintiff: Many. I actually printed out his full vehicle history report. He's been a customer for almost 3 years. I think it comes out to about 16 or 17 total visits. I have here.\nJudge: And so this truck was what kind of truck?\nPlaintiff: Um, it's a potato chip delivery truck.\nJudge: Is that your business?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: Okay. So and according to you, he sleeps... he wakes up early, delivers all the potato chips, filling everyone's potato chip morning need, and sleeps through... so he drops the car off at odd hours when you guys aren't open or...\nPlaintiff: Well, usually midday.\nJudge: Okay. So he drops the car off at midday and then something like that, and then I'm assuming he goes home and gets some rest, and then you fix it, and then he picks it up at odd hours or...\nPlaintiff: After we close. We close at 5:00 p.m.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Um, so usually what we have done many times, pretty much every single time before, is run the credit card on file, leave his keys and receipt inside the truck for him so that he can come back at his convenience and pick up the truck for work tomorrow.\nJudge: Okay. All right, so according to you, you spoke to him not once but twice, and you were reading from something. What were you reading from?\nPlaintiff: Um, this was the original invoice where I was giving you the times off of here.\nJudge: Let me see that.\nPlaintiff: Sure.\nJudge: You can see right... right down... is there somewhere where you handwrite stuff or no? You're inputting it basically all on the computer?\nPlaintiff: Um, you can see where it came in. It says check tires, check brakes, and then down bottom where it's highlighted in yellow. That's when the times of days we actually got the approval to do the different work. When we originally got the charge back from American Express, it said work uh services or goods not received. So I printed out the original invoices. Then we got another charge back from American Express on the same thing that said duplicate billing because he was in with I believe his wife or a girlfriend's vehicle about 9 or 10 days earlier for almost the same amount dollarwise of work.\nJudge: So what's your defense to this? Uh, they're suing you because you called the credit card company and claimed you didn't authorize the work and...\nDefendant: Well, he's right. I did drop my girlfriend's car off. It was about 2 or 3 days earlier. Um, I even said to him... I don't know if I actually spoke with him. I'm not really sure who I spoke with, but I called and I said, \"I'm going to pick her car up. I'll drop my other truck off, and you guys could just look at that at the time.\" And I said, \"Give me a call when you got a number on this one.\" Um, I'm not sure who called me. I... I'm not sure if it was him. I really don't know who I was speaking with on the phone, and they gave me a number, and I said, \"You know, I'm not going to get it done right now. It's... it's too much, you know, just with... I just put out $22,400. I'm going to wait on that cuz I have other trucks.\" Um, so I said, \"I'm going to pick the truck up.\" I didn't know exactly what was uh how bad it would be, but I'll get it fixed. I have another guy that does work on the side for me once in a while. I figured I'll just let him look at it. Eventually they called me back, told me the work was done.\nJudge: I told them... so you're saying you did get a call from them?\nDefendant: Oh, they... they called me and gave me the number.\nJudge: And they gave you the um estimate?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: And you said, \"I told him to hold off on it.\"\nDefendant: Okay.\nJudge: Who did you talk to and say don't do the work?\nDefendant: I... who... if it was him, I'm not sure.\nJudge: There's... are you the one who called him, or did somebody else call him?\nPlaintiff: I believe that was my father who called him.\nJudge: Yeah. And according to you, you said don't do the work to his father, and then his father authorized the work.\nDefendant: Can you get your father on... is your father here?\nPlaintiff: No, he's not here.\nJudge: Is he available by telephone?\nPlaintiff: We can try him.\nJudge: Why don't we try him? Try to get him on the phone, and then once you got him, put him on speaker.\nJudge: So who wins this - the auto repair shop or the customer?\nPlaintiff: The repair shop. Why? Uh, the guy brought his car there, he left it there, and the work got done.\nJudge: Work got done, but the guy says it's unauthorized.\nPlaintiff: He should have never gave up his credit card information in the first place when he dropped his car off.\nJudge: But I don't understand. He gave up his credit card information, but um, he says the work was unauthorized. If the work's unauthorized, then it needs to be on paper at least, and if he doesn't have that, they should have that. So who wins?\nPlaintiff: Honestly, I think the defendant.\nJudge: Okay, going inside the courtroom.\nDefendant: So um, you know, I said, \"Look, I didn't authorize this,\" and they were like, \"Well, we have pictures of...\" I guess they said they took pictures of my... what I needed done... \"You really needed this stuff done, blah, blah, blah.\" I'm like, \"Right now it wasn't the right time for it. I don't... you know, I have other trucks. I could put this truck on hold. I would have got it done.\"\nJudge: Normally, you wouldn't get your car after that if you won't pay. Then they don't give you your car. That's what usually happens.\nDefendant: Well, they already ran my credit card, so they don't care.\nJudge: What's your dad's name?\nPlaintiff: Dad.\nPlaintiff's Father: Yes.\nJudge: How are you?\nPlaintiff's Father: How are you?\nJudge: This is Judge Milan. All right, okay, so can I just ask you, Dan, did you have any conversations yourself with the defendant in this case about the authorization for the repair?\nPlaintiff's Father: I had... I talked to him at the end whenever we finished the repairs about if he really wanted to do the tires not because they're pretty bad.\nJudge: And what did he say?\nPlaintiff's Father: He said put four tires on, two on the front and two on the back, and he let the other ones go because they were in really bad shape.\nJudge: How many tires are on the truck?\nPlaintiff's Father: Uh, there's six.\nJudge: Okay. And so uh, you had that conversation. Did you have the original conversation on the brake job and the and the uh oil change?\nPlaintiff's Father: Yeah, in the morning.\nJudge: So you talked to him twice that day?\nPlaintiff's Father: Yes.\nJudge: All right, and in the original conversation, what was the conversation? Did he tell you, \"No, don't do the repair\"?\nPlaintiff's Father: No, he told me to go ahead with everything, just don't do the tires because he originally came in for the brakes and tires. And then when he found out how much the brakes were, cuz they were really shot, he says, \"Just do the brakes for now.\" So then I called them back to tell him that the brakes are all done. Then he said... I said to him, I said, \"You sure you don't want to put, you know, a few tires on this thing? They're pretty bad.\" And he goes, \"Well, just put four on. Don't put all six on.\" I said, \"Okay,\" and we took care of that.\nJudge: What say you to what senior's saying right now?\nDefendant: I spoke to somebody once. I don't know if he called me, and I... the first... I spoke to somebody one time, and I was just say... and that was after they were like, \"You're ready. You know, your car is ready to be uh picked up.\"\nJudge: Did he ever call... did you... who calls him to let him know his car is ready?\nPlaintiff's Father: Me.\nJudge: All right, so that's after putting the tires on, right?\nPlaintiff's Father: Okay.\nJudge: So when you call... said just leave it outside, and he... he'd call me back with the credit card later.\nPlaintiff's Father: I thought you had the credit card on file.\nDefendant: No, we didn't... no, we had a credit card on file from the girlfriend. And then whenever he called back with the credit card number, it was the same number we had for his girlfriend.\nJudge: Cuz your son was saying you already had it on file, but you're saying he gave it to you, right?\nPlaintiff's Father: I just wanted to make sure that was the credit card he was going to use because the credit card we had was from the girlfriend, and that was the same credit card number that he had given us.\nJudge: All right. Thank you, senior.\nPlaintiff's Father: You're welcome.\nJudge: Thank you. Bye-bye.\nDefendant: I don't know how to use a Samsung.\nJudge: All right, so your plan is to do what? I realized that you had one credit card statement with thousands and thousands of dollars in charges, but what's your plan? Your plan is is that you're going to get away with a free break, free oil, um, four new tires, and that they're going to eat all that?\nDefendant: Well, when I called the credit card company, they asked me if I want to dispute the charge, and I said yeah. They didn't offer me like, \"Hey, do you want to pay part of it?\" That wasn't part of the deal. Um, it was no... I didn't... they said, \"Did you authorize this?\" I said no, and they did their investigation or whatever they...\nJudge: You know how they don't do... they basic... you... I'll tell you what they do. I'm not bound by them anyway. Do is they rule on the side of their customer when they can cuz you're their customer, depending on the card. Not every card does that.\nJudge: All right, Gerald, I'm uh... I'm a little uncomfortable... um, I'm having a hard time thinking that they did this work without your authorization. I'm going to order you to pay them the money you owe them, which is $2,421.47.\nDefendant: Thank you.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection"}
{"id": "192", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Douglas. Welcome. Erica Williams?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: You are suing Leora Schwarz for $500 of a deposit that you want returned to you. You feel you are entitled to it, and she feels she is not. Let me hear from you. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Back in August, I was looking at a listing to look up apartments. I ran across Ms. Schwarz’s apartment. I contacted her. She asked me how much I had toward the deposit. I deposited $500 into her personal account at Chase.\n\nJudge: Because you saw the apartment and you liked it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. How many bedrooms?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a two-bedroom, two-bath.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: So, once I did that, I spoke with her, and she asked me when I could come up with the deposit. She told me that I needed to get it in before 4:00 PM that business day.\n\nJudge: So, were you going to take the place?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I was going to take the unit.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, you are receiving Section 8 assistance, correct? Government assistance to pay your rent?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: So then began the process of Section 8 approval because you can’t move in and they won’t pay the rent unless they’ve approved it and made sure that it’s safe and everything else, right?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: But something breaks down in the relationship between you two before that. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It seems as if once I gave her my money into that account, she started having these crazy demands. She wanted to come to my place where I was residing to see how I kept that unit, which I thought was weird.\n\nPlaintiff: Then, I had asked her what my balance was. I knew it was like $675—that’s what I was assuming. But she told me that it was $22,000 and something for me to move in for first and last.\n\nJudge: Hold on. Can I have the lease?\n\nDefendant: Sure.\n\nJudge: Yeah, there is no first and last. There is only the security and the first month. The apartment is how much a month?\n\nDefendant: $1,275.\n\nJudge: Correct. Right. So, if it’s $1,275, and all you paid was $500, then you’re supposed to pay $2,050. Why was that a big surprise? It’s what you signed, in other words. It’s right here. You signed it. So, that’s not a surprise. She didn’t change the rules on you.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: So, what happens then?\n\nPlaintiff: She wanted to do inventory of what I was moving into the unit and stuff like that. She wanted to be there when I moved all my things in, and that kind of just threw me overboard. I was just like, why?\n\nJudge: Just say no. Just have a right to be there while you’re moving your stuff in. You know, you’re moving in. If you’re paying rent from that day, your landlord doesn’t have a right to sit around your apartment. So, what happens when she says that?\n\nPlaintiff: I just told her she was doing a little bit too much, and I wasn’t going to go ahead with the unit.\n\nJudge: Okay. I want to see—did she text you that she wanted to be there when you moved in?\n\nPlaintiff: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me see the texts. Did you text her that you insist on being there when she moved in?\n\nDefendant: No. I told her that I needed to be there because we still needed to do the money exchange.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: She already had the keys.\n\nJudge: So, what you wanted to do was meet her there or be there while she moved in?\n\nDefendant: Meet her there for the money exchange, so she could move in and sign the lease.\n\nJudge: So, your position is that you never said to her, \"I'm going to stand around watching you move in,\" but instead, \"I have to meet you there because you owe me money and we need to sign the lease.\"\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, let’s get the exact language. Maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\nJudge (reading text): \"Be there because that's how it's done. At that time, you will sign the lease, rider, and move-in inventory. You need to give me at that point the security deposit and the pro-rated rent of September. Only then can you actually bring your stuff in. So please, as I’ve told you a few days ago, let’s coordinate when you’re going to come in because you still owe money and have to sign a renewed lease.\"\n\nJudge: No problem, and that’s when I'll put the lights in my name, and thank you. So apparently, that wasn’t a problem. You did understand what she meant.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: She was just rubbing you the wrong way?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I know. Listen, lady, you're a bit too much. \"I have no time for drama or anything, so I'm thinking about not even moving into your unit. My vibe doesn’t adapt to yours, and the shower isn’t going to work for my standards.\"\n\nJudge: All right. Now, so you lost out on rent for September, correct?\n\nDefendant: Plus, I had to pay out of pocket. She never returned the keys. I had to change the locks the next day and had to put my apartment back on the market.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you’re demanding your $500 back. Tell me, on what legal basis would she have to give it back to you? What did she do?\n\nJudge: If the tenant didn’t like the landlord’s vibe, does the tenant have the right to say, \"I’m not going to move in, and I want my deposit back\"?\n\nAudience Member: No.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nAudience Member: Because you have an agreement. Once you have a contract or a verbal agreement to make a deposit, you have to pay.\n\nJudge: Anybody disagree with that?\n\nAudience Member: I disagree completely. If the tenant is not comfortable moving in, there is no reason to hold the deposit.\n\nJudge: I completely disagree with you, but you’re kind of convincing. That’s very interesting.\n\nJudge: The law is on her side. Deposits are non-refundable.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "exaggeration, emotional appeal, playing the victim role"}

Tell me what happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, your honor. On January 7th of this year, I brought my daughter to the American Legion to a baby shower. We had stopped and got a gift, so my daughter asked prior to me leaving, \"Can I wait to see if the baby shower is still going on?\" Because it was pretty late, so some people might have done that before the start of the baby shower.

The guy hit my car.\" So I get out.\n\nJUDGE: Wait, what guy hit your car?\n\nPLAINTIFF: It was a guy that had like eight or nine, 10 carriages.\n\nJUDGE: Like the grocery store cart carriages?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Are you talking about shopping carts?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Shopping carts, exactly.

Here's what you said: \"I was texting and then I heard something, but I paid it no mind, and then I decided he hit my car.\"\n\nPLAINTIFF: That doesn't… okay, I kind of not realized he hit my car.\n\nJUDGE: Didn't you? Did you hear it? Did you feel it? Did you see it?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I did, but I was also into my text.\n\nJUDGE: Wow. Who were you texting? What were you saying that was that good and juicy that you would not feel or notice someone hit your BMW?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Who was…\n\nJUDGE: Okay, so go ahead.\n\nPLAINTIFF: All right.

John's, are you the owner?\n\n[Defendant]\nYes, I am.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. John's entertainment company, party company, for $650, the amount that you paid him for your child's party that you say was ruined because he didn't deliver what he was supposed to deliver. Tell me what happened.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nOkay. On the date of July 21st, I had a party for Malachi, my son.\n\n[Judge]\nHow old is Malachi?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nYes, and how old is Malachi? He's five.\n\n[Judge]\nFive.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nOkay. Everything started off good.\n\n[Judge]\nWhat did you hire the defendant to do?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nI hired him for delivering a bouncy house. Also, along with that, I hired him for a magician as well as a clown.\n\n[Judge]\nA clown who was supposed to come with an assistant?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nYes.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. According to the contract, for that you were paying $650. Yes?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nYes.\n\n[Judge]\nBefore the party, you paid the entire amount?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nMhm.\n\n[Judge]\nAnd what went wrong?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nWhat went wrong is that the clown, he arrived late.\n\n[Judge]\nWhat time was the clown supposed to arrive?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nThe clown was supposed to be there between 6:00 to 6:30. He arrived at 6:45.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nThen he arrived alone. Upon arriving, I asked him, \"Okay, where's the helper?\" Because there was someone supposed to be a helper to do the cotton candy while the clown is, you know, doing his clown show. His helper was supposed to be assisting him.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nHe said he was never supposed to have a helper. I was like, \"Okay, all right.\" He proceeded to do whatever he was doing. That was fine.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nI believe he left like 7:00.\n\n[Judge]\nAnd the magician was supposed to get there at what time?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nBetween 7:30 and 8:00.\n\n[Judge]\nSo he could have gotten there at 8:00... Sorry, 7:59?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nAll right. Let me see both of your copies of the contract.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nSure.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. So the contract says: 30-minute magic show arriving between 7:30 and 8:00; one-hour clown package arriving between 6:00 and 6:30. All right, so go on.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nOkay. Um, I never heard from him. I have a copy of my bill when I started to call the magician—I mean, the guy that delivered the bouncy house, because that was the only number I had. I called him at 7:56.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. And you have the phone records to prove it?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nOkay. And he told me that he had no idea where they were. He's going to contact John.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nAfter that, I called the company. I told them I was upset. It's 8:00. I'm driving kids home now. Where is the magician? No one knew where this guy was.\n\n[Plaintiff]\nWhy was I not called to say, \"Okay, I got lost, I'm in progress, I'm on my way,\" whatever?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nHe arrived at 8:25, and that's why my brother called me to let me know.\n\n[Judge]\nWhere's the rest of this phone bill so I can see when your brother called you?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nOh, sorry.\n\n[Judge]\nAre you the brother?\n\n[Plaintiff’s Brother]\nYes.\n\n[Judge]\nCome on and stand up next to her. What's your name?\n\n[Plaintiff’s Brother]\nKing, ma'am.\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. We won't air this number, but your number is what?   [Plaintiff’s Brother]\nMy number is [redacted for privacy].\n\n[Judge]\nOkay. And what time did you call her?\n\n[Plaintiff’s Brother]\nI called her at 8:25 when the magician arrived.\n\n[Judge]\nAll right. So what happened when he showed up at 8:25?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nBy that time, the kids had already gone home. There was no one to entertain, and the party was essentially over.\n\n[Judge]\nDid you refuse to let him perform when he arrived?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nYes, because there was no point. The kids were gone, and I was upset.\n\n[Judge]\nDid you ask for a refund then and there?\n\n[Plaintiff]\nI did, and he refused. He told me that he still had to be paid because he showed up.\n\n[Judge to Defendant]\nNow, John, tell me what happened from your perspective.\n\n[Defendant]\nYour Honor, the magician was delayed because he got lost and couldn’t find the plaintiff’s house. He called me once he was already late, and I tried to direct him as best I could. But by the time he got there, it was too late.\n\n[Judge]\nWhy wasn’t the plaintiff informed that the magician was running late?\n\n[Defendant]\nThat was our mistake. We should have communicated better, but I didn’t think it would be such a big deal since the magician showed up eventually.\n\n[Judge]\nWhat about the clown arriving late and without an assistant?\n\n[Defendant]\nThe assistant called out sick that day, and I didn’t have a replacement available. I apologize for that, but it’s not something we could control.\n\n[Judge]\nWhy not offer a partial refund since most of what you promised wasn’t delivered?\n\n[Defendant]\nWe don’t offer refunds once we’ve committed the time and effort to send our performers out.\n\n[Judge]\nAll right, I’ve heard enough. Here’s the problem, John: You were hired to provide specific services within a specific timeframe, and you didn’t deliver. The clown was late and showed up without an assistant, and the magician didn’t arrive until after the party was over. These are significant breaches of the agreement.\n\n[Defendant]\nBut we still made an effort to show up.\n\n[Judge]\nEffort doesn’t count if the services are not performed as promised. The plaintiff is entitled to a full refund. I’m ordering you to return the $650.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection Dismissal Minimization Emotional Appeal"}

You say you're out actually $6,500 in consulting fees that, according to you, she owes you and the shelter that she's building owes you and has not paid you. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m an accountant by profession. I start businesses for people and nonprofit organizations. I've done many in the past. She came in and said she wanted to start a homeless shelter. She had just received a request for qualifications from the county. She asked if I would assist in preparing these documents and what she needed to start a homeless shelter.\n\nJudge: Okay, hold on. Let me ask you a question. What had caused you to decide to do this?\n\nPlaintiff: At first, I started working with disadvantaged children in child care, and a lot of them came from the shelter, and I just wanted to do something different. I just wanted to give them a better set, an atmosphere.\n\nJudge: Okay, now how would the funds to run this come from the city, the county?\n\nPlaintiff: The county.\n\nJudge: The county, and then you would draw a salary, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: And obviously, other employees would draw a salary as well, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Alright. Now, how did you know about him?\n\nDefendant: He prepared my taxes one year.\n\nJudge: Did you have a business back then or was it personal?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I’ve had a business for 10 years. I've been contracted, so he did the business taxes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Now, you ask him to do what?\n\nDefendant: Actually, I didn’t ask him. He called me. We’ve always talked and joked, and I said, “I’m a little stressed right now because I have to have a nonprofit organization corporation within a matter of like 25 days or so.” And then I explained to him what I had received that day in the mail, and he said, “Oh, I can get it done in about a week.” I said, “You could?” He said, “Yeah, bring it in, let me see what you got.”\n\nJudge: So, you go there?\n\nDefendant: So, I go there and I show him the letter. Would you like to see it? I show him the letter and I let him read it, and it says exactly what I needed.\n\nJudge: Let me see the letter.\n\nDefendant: And what are you going to pay him to do this? Is he doing it as a volunteer? Do you guys just not discuss it?\n\nDefendant: So, I said to him, “I have three properties on the same block. I’m going to turn them into emergency housing, and I’ll just buy another property and move elsewhere.” So, as time goes on, we’re working on this corporation. He charges me $550. I swipe my card here.\n\nJudge: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. He charges you $550?\n\nDefendant: When? October 20th, let me see, of what year?\n\nJudge: 2011, he charges you that for what?\n\nDefendant: To do the corporation.\n\nJudge: But are those the fees that he’s paying to the city or county? That’s what it costs to get the corporation, but that doesn’t go into his pocket for work, right?\n\nDefendant: Okay, those are the fees. Go on.\n\nDefendant: No, so I even paid the additional money for it to be expedited because I needed it like in a matter of 20 days.\n\nJudge: Did you agree to pay him for his services?\n\nDefendant: No, just it wasn’t even mentioned. No, it’s not like he said, “I am volunteering my services.” No, because the intentions were we were working on this together.\n\nJudge: According to you, you wanted to do what at that shelter?\n\nDefendant: What did you—what would you—if you could have written the script of how this would have ended up, what was your hope that you would end up being CFO?\n\nPlaintiff: I was an accountant. She asked me to be the accountant for the firm, the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nJudge: Yeah, did you use the term CFO?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Yes, and when did you let her know that that is what you wanted?\n\nPlaintiff: Just before we sent out the 501c3.\n\nJudge: What I’d like to know is, do you have any—what is your testimony about what you were supposed to be paid? Because you’re in here asking for $16,500 for some forms that were obtained.\n\nPlaintiff: I faxed through a third-party, Blumberg Excelsior. I sent them the information on the corporation. They sent me back the paperwork, and the $550 that she’s speaking of, those are just filing fees.\n\nJudge: May I see the proof of what you paid?\n\nPlaintiff: While you’re sitting there discussing with her opening up this shelter and doing this wonderful service, when does someone tell you, “I’ll pay you as a nonprofit $16,500 for helping us out by filling out these forms and a pen?”\n\nPlaintiff: When we did the budget, the budget included her salary of $130,000, and it included mine of $18,000.\n\nJudge: Yes, there’s three different homes. Let me see the budget that included yours of 18, and that budget that I submitted to the county and also to the IRS, and she signed it. Here, she signed it twice. This is the last page.\n\nJudge: No, I want the whole plan. This is the whole budget.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, there’s a signature page where it says, “I got it.”\n\nJudge: Hand the budget over.\n\nDefendant: Okay.\n\nJudge: Okay. This says 18,000 is you estimating in the budget your professional fees from July 2012 to December 2012, assuming that you were going to be an employee. My question to you is, how are you going to prove to me that she agreed to pay you this kind of dough for setting up the paperwork? I’m looking at the paperwork. I see how much was involved. I also see how much was not involved. It’s not checking off a box and sending it in, but it’s also not $16,500.\n\nDefendant: You’re angry because what happened? What happened when he asked to be CFO?\n\nPlaintiff: So do you believe this accountant was really going to get $16,500 bucks?\n\nDefendant: Not at all.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant: Because it’s a homeless shelter. You would do it for free, or you would find somebody who would do it for free.\n\nJudge: Agreed or not, I just—I don’t—yeah, he should have just agreed to do it for free.\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Fair enough. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nPlaintiff: I said, \"What is that?\" and he said, \"Chief Financial Officer.\" So I said, \"Let me think about this.\" I spoke with someone else who is in this line of work. She says, \"No, you don’t want that. Those companies go under. Very dangerous move.\"\n\nDefendant: I’m watching government politics, and it’s the same thing that’s going on, how they were having overspending in government. But I was trying to be fair. I said, “I do have a problem with that. I’ve been doing business by myself with the county for over 10 years. I can’t do that.”\n\nJudge: Got it.\n\nJudge: Now, when you submitted the paperwork and you had all the director’s salaries and you had all the employees’ salaries, you know who’s like blatantly missing from there? A CFO. That gets paid. How much did he want to get paid?\n\nDefendant: Oh, that salary was about $20,000.\n\nJudge: If that.\n\nDefendant: Let me tell you what I think happened. What I think happened is that everybody’s very excited about the idea of getting this government grant because it’s a lot of money involved, alright? And nobody is talking about remuneration for filling out these forms. You are doing it because you have an end game in mind, and when your endgame conflicts with her endgame, all of a sudden it’s, “Oh my God, I put all this work in, we did this together, and now I get nothing out of this.” Forget it. And then magically, there’s a $16,500 bill.\n\nDefendant: Now, where did anyone agree to pay you $16,500 for your work?\n\nPlaintiff: I put it in the budget.\n\nJudge: No, you didn’t. Don’t lie. That is not. No, there’s $18,000 in the budget for a prospective salary, not for filling out the forms. A year earlier, you know that.\n\nJudge: Okay, I saw your text where you say to her, “Am I still working on this with you, or should I send you a bill?” and you say to him, “Send me a bill.” You end up getting a $16,500 bill, right?\n\nPlaintiff: And obviously, I don’t believe that you owe that, but he’s out certain monies by incorporating you and he’s out a certain amount of time. And what I’m going to do is I’m going to assess what I believe is the fair value of it.\n\nJudge: I am awarding the plaintiff $750.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization, Gaslighting, Deflection, Minimization, Persuasion"}

{"id": "323", "dialogue": "\nJudge: Okay. You are suing Ron Kelly, your former boyfriend, for $420.68 that you say he owes you and has not fully paid you for. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: He told me one day that—\n\nJudge: How did you two know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought we were in a relationship.\n\nJudge: He told me we were never in a relationship?\n\nPlaintiff: He says that.\n\nJudge: Did he tell you that at the time?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Were you intimate?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: There you go. Alright, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: So one day we were coming from somewhere, and when he got home, he got outside of the place and said, \"Somebody slashed my tire.\"\n\nJudge: Did he have a wife or a girlfriend while this was going on?\n\nPlaintiff: He had a whole lot of girlfriends, and he had a wife too.\n\nJudge: Oh lord. Alright, maybe that’s who slashed his tires. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So, um, he said he had to get his tire fixed. So I met him at the auto shop, and I swiped my card to pay for the tire.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he said he needed a tire, and he gets whatever he needs from whoever he needs it.\n\nJudge: Well, apparently. If you knew that he had girlfriends and a wife, and you’re—you know, that’s kind of interesting. Alright, so you go ahead, and you pay for the tire. And does he ever pay you anything at the place?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: By the way, what day was this?\n\nPlaintiff: I have the receipt.\n\nJudge: Yeah, go ahead. You can look at it.\n\nPlaintiff: This was done on 10/26/2014.\n\nJudge: What’s going on here? How is this happening? Is this like a reflection of what’s happening in the politics? What’s going on? Okay. He’s owed you this for four years?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And how come you’ve waited this long to file the lawsuit?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he kept saying he was going to pay me back, and I just waited. And plus, we were sleeping together.\n\nJudge: Okay, be honest. Would you ever date a married man?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Anybody?\n\nPlaintiff: No, never.\n\nJudge: Somebody super hot?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Would you ever date—whoever I talk to—would you ever date a married man?\n\nPlaintiff: I would not date a married man.\n\nJudge: Who’s going to budge here?\n\nPlaintiff: [Pauses] No.\n\nJudge: Well, that wasn’t convincing.\n\n[Continuing inside the courtroom]\n\nJudge: Okay. When was the last time he paid you anything?\n\nPlaintiff: He paid me $50.\n\nJudge: When was that?\n\nPlaintiff: May 18th.\n\nJudge: Of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: This year.\n\nJudge: Okay. What’s going on?\n\nDefendant: First of all, I didn’t—I didn’t—I’ve been divorced. I wasn’t—I didn’t have a wife at the time that I was, uh, dealing with her.\n\nJudge: Did you have a girlfriend that you were stepping out on with her?\n\nDefendant: Uh, no. No. See, here’s the situation, Judge. We had been going back and forth, um, and she did give me the money for the tire, but I never said I was going to pay her back. But what happened was, we’d go back—we’d been going back and forth, in and out of, like you said, whatever. And, um, it seemed like when we broke up, she would ask me for the money. And when we got back together, she wouldn’t ask me for the money.\n\nJudge: So it was kind of like, you know, as long as we were together, you didn’t have to worry about the money?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that could be true. But you—you—you could also still have owed her the money. That could have been still your understanding. I mean, why should she pay for your tire?\n\nDefendant: Well—\n\nJudge: $420 for one tire? That’s a lot of money for her to just suddenly go pay for you. Why didn’t you pay it yourself?\n\nDefendant: Because I didn’t ask for the money. And I’ve never gotten a dime back from any lady I’ve ever dealt with in a relationship. I’ve never gotten a penny back from any.\n\nJudge: You ever sued for it?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Oh, you should sue.\n\nDefendant: Because it’s—you know, it’s kind of—you know, we all kind of know that if we give a woman money, you don’t expect to get it back.\n\nJudge: Okay, so if you give a man money in a relationship, you don’t expect to get it back?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Right. And that is true if the reason you gave the money was a gift because you were in a relationship. It is not true if the reason was a loan because you expected to get paid back.\n\nJudge: It’s your word against hers—except for one thing. You made a $50 payment, right?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: Why, if it was a gift?\n\nDefendant: Well, because she was harassing me, calling me on my cell phone. When I blocked her number, she called me from a different number. So there was no way to get away from it. So what I did was I said, \"Okay, I’ll give you some money just to—\"\n\nJudge: Then why didn’t you keep paying it off?\n\nDefendant: Because I didn’t feel like I owed her any money.\n\nJudge: But you told her daughter you would pay biweekly.\n\nDefendant: [Pauses]\n\nJudge: Based on what I’ve heard, I’m ordering you to pay the remaining $420.68.

{"id": "300", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Mark Brown. He says he rented a condo for a week on the island of St. Martin, and as it turned out, that was the week Hurricane Irma hit. The resort where the condo was located was shut down due to the storm, and when he asked for his money back, the defendant told him he would only refund half. Half? The condo was uninhabitable. There was no way anyone could stay there, and he's owed a full refund in the amount of $800. That's what he's suing for.\n\nThis is the defendant, Earl Cap. He says he always tells renters to get insurance for things like hurricanes, which the plaintiff has done in the past because he's rented from them before. This time, for whatever reason, the plaintiff opted not to get the insurance. A hurricane hit, and now he wants a full refund from him? No way. He’s not entitled to a refund.\n\nHe’s accused of creating a financial disaster. The defendant has filed a countersuit for $432 for monies he had to pay the resort.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff rented a condo in St. Martin, put down a deposit, but then Hurricane Irma hit. The resort was a wreck, and he couldn't go, so he wants his deposit back. The defendant says he should have gotten renter’s insurance. It’s the case of Rock Me Like a Hurricane.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nMark Brown, you are suing Earl and Carol Cap for $800, a deposit that you put on a timeshare rental, and you want it returned to you. You are counterclaiming against him for some extra money you put towards the resort in order for him to be able to rent a bigger unit, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. Have you ever stayed in that timeshare before?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, his timeshare, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And when you did that—you own a timeshare and you rent out—do you rent it out every year?\n\nDefendant: Uh, it depends on the timeshare and who the guest is.\n\nJudge: How often do you end up renting it out?\n\nDefendant: Um, it depends. Usually once, maybe twice per year.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you own several timeshares?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: How many?\n\nDefendant: We’re timeshare junkies. We own about six of them.\n\nJudge: All right, so sometimes you use them, sometimes you rent them out?\n\nDefendant: We always use them, and our contracts allow us to use excess time that we can then rent out.\n\nJudge: Right. All right, so you were going—where is this particular one located?\n\nDefendant: This one is at Divi Little Bay Resort on the island of St. Martin.\n\nJudge: That’s the Caribbean?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you’ve rented that one before?\n\nPlaintiff: I’ve rented that before.\n\nJudge: And how much were you paying for it?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, $1,600 a week.\n\nJudge: Something funny happened on the way to the forum—a hurricane hit, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And that was the week you were going to be there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: A few months later, the island was devastated, basically unusable, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: The resort was closed at that time?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Has the resort ever reopened?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it reopened afterward.\n\nJudge: So, he wants his deposit back because the place was closed and he couldn’t go. Why aren’t you returning his deposit?\n\nDefendant: Mark rented in 2015 a week from us at a different resort on the same island, and it was under the same terms. That is to say, we are not a company—we dispose of personally available time, and we do not offer cancellation insurance or interruption insurance. We ask all guests to get the same to protect themselves because we don’t offer any protection.\n\nJudge: Can I see any written paperwork between you two? Any emails, anything like that? Any contract?\n\nDefendant: There’s no contract. Just an email with the deposit made, the dates, and the confirmation from the resort.\n\nJudge: Do you have a written agreement with him—Mark Brown?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything where he acknowledges that it’s his responsibility to get insurance?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So if a hurricane hits an island where you rent a condo, can you get your deposit back?\n\nJudge: I’m not 100% sure, but I don’t think so—unless you’ve got some kind of insurance specifically for that.\n\nJudge: Anybody have a different opinion? Going once? Going twice?\n\n(There is silence from the audience.)\n\nJudge: I can’t believe nobody’s saying this. Nobody has any idea? Higher force? Whatever?\n\nJudge: I’ve looked through the only paperwork anybody’s given me, and nowhere does it say the following: You assume the risk of an act of God.\n\nJudge: I would never rent a place that had me assume the risk of an act of God. If you had a contract with him that said, You assume the risk of an act of God, I could understand you saying, “Hey buddy, I’m out the money. I’m not a company. I spent your money and don’t want to pay it back.”\n\nJudge: But the deal is, he’s renting a place he can go to, and now he can’t go to it anymore. And you’re assuming that’s a him problem? I’m looking at it as a you problem.\n\nJudge: You really think you need to raise your hand? Because I don’t see how that means he has to take a vacation at a different time.\n\nJudge: You have the ability to find a solution. You can rent it out at another time because the timeshare allows you to rent that time. You understand what having a right to a place means.\n\nJudge: And you are having them provide you with a subsequent time to rent out or use. So you’re not really out. The guy who’s out is him.\n\nJudge: And he’s out how much? What was the deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: $800.\n\nJudge: Right. So tell me where I’m not getting this.\n\nDefendant: The money we had to pay to the resort for the upgrade for the Brown family was a one-time, specific-date reservation.\n\nJudge: If the resort couldn’t give it to you, then they would let you rent it at a different time.\n\nJudge: You are now able to rent out a one-bedroom instead of a studio, right?\n\nDefendant: Actually, no. Only the studio.\n\nJudge: Well, then, I suggest you go through the resort.\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the plaintiff in this case for $800. On the counterclaim, zero.

Michael Arthur, you are suing Derek O'Grady for $2,400 for four days of work that you say he owes you for Bobcat services at a construction site. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Good morning, Your Honor. I put an ad on Craigslist later in the summer to dig up some extra money for myself and my family. I have the ad right here—it says “Bobcat operator, skilled operator for Bobcat hire.” So, I got many calls. Derek was one of them. He called me on a Thursday, I believe, and asked me if I could be out there on a Monday to do some work, which was about 50 miles from my home. I said, “No problem.” So, I loaded everything up. I get to the first job site...\n\nJudge: This is a Bobcat? If you don’t know what it is...\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I know what a Bobcat is, but I love pictures. So, I get to the first job site in Sound Beach, and he walks me around his property and shows me what to do. There was about 100 yards of soil...\n\nJudge: We call it fill in the industry.\n\nPlaintiff: That was ripped out and piled on this guy’s property that had to be moved and put in dumpsters.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: I have some video of the property before I started any work. It’s queued up on my phone.\n\nJudge: What is your custom? To video before the work and video after the work?\n\nPlaintiff: He showed me what to do, so I walked around with my phone. Every contractor should be doing that.\n\nJudge: I agree. So, how long did it take?\n\nPlaintiff: I was there three days, unfortunately. I don’t have any pictures of the final work, which I should have brought.\n\nJudge: Oh, you should do that. Why don’t you tape the final work, especially when that’s when you have the motive to tape it? Because according to you, the guy wasn’t paying you.\n\nPlaintiff: I can get the owner of that house on the phone right now.\n\nJudge: No, it’s fine. I’m just curious why, when you’re doing everything right, you didn’t document that part. So, you worked that first day and didn’t get paid?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I worked the first day, worked very hard, and was supposed to be paid daily. I asked him to be paid, and he said, “How about I pay you tomorrow? Come in for work tomorrow.” I said, “No problem.” I showed up at 7:00 AM, worked all day again, and said, “I really need some money.”\n\nJudge: How many warnings do you need? If the guy can’t fork up $600...\n\nPlaintiff: I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nJudge: Because you knew him so well?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know him at all.\n\nJudge: But you’re Craigslist buddies. Nothing ever goes wrong on Craigslist, right?\n\nPlaintiff: No, nothing ever goes wrong...\n\nJudge: It’s a hard lesson.\n\nPlaintiff: So, now it’s day three. I show up and do work again.\n\nJudge: Then day four comes. What happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I told my wife, “I’m going to go to the job and sit there until he pays me.”\n\nJudge: Good.\n\nPlaintiff: So, he shows up, asks me what to do. I said, “Derek, I’m not going to move this machine until I’m paid for the three days.”\n\nDefendant: I had to go to the bank.\n\nPlaintiff: He left and came back an hour later with no money.\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: “I’m waiting for checks to clear.”\n\nJudge: But people know that before they go to the bank!\n\nPlaintiff: He promised me extra money—four days' pay plus $200. Here are the texts.\n\nJudge: What’s going on?\n\nDefendant: He worked, and I told him I was waiting for funds to clear.\n\nJudge: Have they cleared?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then why haven’t you paid him?\n\nDefendant: The following week, I met him and offered some money.\n\nJudge: How many days did he work?\n\nDefendant: Three. The fourth day, he just sat there.\n\nJudge: But you want to get paid for sitting there?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, I moved a shed at his request.\n\nDefendant: That was on the third day. He’s lying.\n\nJudge: Is there a police report?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here it is.\n\nJudge: Did you give him credit cards to charge?\n\nDefendant: He ran them when I told him not to.\n\nJudge: The charges were declined?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why all these excuses?\n\nDefendant: I was waiting on money.\n\nJudge: A month and a half later?

Derek owed the homeowner money.\n\nJudge: Did you tell the homeowner your father died and needed $3,000?\n\nDefendant: My stepfather is alive...\n\nJudge: But you told the homeowner otherwise?\n\nDefendant: (No response.)\n\nJudge: We don’t know what’s true with you.

She tells you, \"Go ahead, you got plenty of room.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nAnd I’m telling her, no, you go ahead. But I guess she was just parked there.\n\nJudge:\nBut this is not this wide. It's not.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nOkay, so there's no line in between?\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nNo.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nSo, there's really just room for one car. It's a dead-end block. It only has the building that Mr. Rink was going to and I think another building.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what happened, though? Why'd you hit his car?\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nI’m going to tell you. So, she’s parked. Let’s say it’s not this wide, it’s only wide like for this. So, there’s cars parked here, cars parked here, she’s double-parked. Right? I come across this way. I’m trying, I stop right here, I tell her to go, she doesn’t. I’m telling her, I can’t fit, move. And she’s looking at me like, “I’m not going anywhere.” So, I tried to get through. Obviously, I took the mirror. My mirror hit his mirror.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, why am I here? What’s your defense? I don’t understand.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nThe fact that she was double-parked. Really.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, because that’s why you’re not going to pay this nice guy? Because somebody else caused you to drive recklessly?\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nI don't think it was. I was not driving recklessly.\n\nJudge:\nBut hold on. There was an accident because you misgauged it.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nWhen she said you go, you went, stepped on the accelerator and started driving.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you come back? This guy was waiting for you for three hours.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nWe spoke, we agreed on it. She said she would come back and take care of it.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nYes, I called him back. It wasn’t like I just left him there.\n\nJudge:\nYou agreed to meet, but you didn’t show up?\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nYes, you agreed to meet. And then, you didn’t.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nI called him back and told him I was still in the process.\n\nJudge:\nBut then you didn’t come back.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nShe said yes, she would, and then she didn’t.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you pay this man for this mirror?\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nI don’t think it was my fault. It was because the lady was illegally parked.\n\nJudge:\nThen don’t go! Don’t go up.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nOkay, right. Like what you’re saying, I shouldn’t have.\n\nJudge:\nIf you do something because you misgauged whether you could or not, it really doesn't matter to me if somebody else was stationary. You were trying to avoid her. That makes no difference. You made a decision to drive, and your driving caused the mirror to come down. How can you possibly... possibly end up doing this to this nice man? Not just leaving him there for three hours, but then after that, after he reaches you and you speak all those times... what is she saying? “Yes, I’ll pay for it,” and then no.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nAbsolutely not.\n\nJudge:\nOnly that she put her boyfriend on the phone. Who’s the boyfriend? Get on up here. I want to hear your story.\n\nPlaintiff (Herman Rink):\nHe told me that they’d absolutely see to it that I’d be paid the money. And then what happened?\n\nJudge:\nI guess it was just like... miscommunication.\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nWhat miscommunication?\n\nJudge:\nYou’re going to pay me, and then you don’t. Oh, absolutely not.\n\nJudge:\nI’m coming back, and then you leave the guy hanging for three hours. Where’s the miscommunication?\n\nDefendant (Trudy Gerini):\nI just didn’t think I should pay.\n\nJudge:\nStop with the excuses, and pay the nice man $352.36, plus your court costs.

{"id": "139", "dialogue": "Judge: Alright, Lorna, you've asked us to refer to you only by your first name, and we'll respect that. You are suing Linda Laramore. Am I allowed to use your last name?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: For $295 that you say she owes you because you paid her that to use her car and she didn't let you use her car. Tell me what's going on.\nPlaintiff: I met Linda. We became friends. I had moved to Florida for a job and had a car with that job, and it fell through. Basically, she would let me use the car. I would fill the gas tank, give her money for gas because she was financially in certain dire straits, so I would help her.\nJudge: So you were doing that just to be a helpful person or because she was giving you rides places?\nPlaintiff: No, I was using the car. She wasn't giving me rides. I was actually using the car, and I would also— we would share the use of the car.\nJudge: Okay, and were you paying her for that?\nPlaintiff: In the beginning, I was not. I was filling her gas tank, and I was using the car.\nJudge: That's how you were paying her?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: And I was using the car very minimally, maybe to go to the gym. It wasn't a mile or two.\nPlaintiff: Okay, then she came to me April 9th. She was behind two car payments. The third car payment would result in a repossession. I don't believe I— I don't know if she asked, but I said, \"Look, I will pay this car payment so you will not be behind three car payments and get your car repossessed.\" In lieu of that, I can use the car for a month. I will schedule it, let you know when I need it, and we will share the car. I will do this for you so that way you won't be out the money.\nJudge: So she wasn't going to pay you back; she was just going to let you use the car?\nPlaintiff: Correct, but she was already letting you use the car. Were you letting her use the car?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay, because you were close friends?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: And I had surgery in March and had a total shoulder replacement. I couldn't drive anyway for six weeks.\nJudge: So was she driving you places?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Some of the time.\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: How long had you two been friends? It's so sad that you're here.\nPlaintiff: Four months, three or four months.\nJudge: Okay, and did she give you $295? Did she make that payment of $295?\nPlaintiff: She gave me the money, yes.\nJudge: And when did she do that?\nPlaintiff: I don't remember. I have the information. I have the coupon of the car payment that I made her give me just to make sure that that was the amount. And I have the withdrawal from the bank of $300.\nJudge: And what date did that occur?\nPlaintiff: April 9th. The car coupon where she was behind on the car payment was April 8th.\nJudge: Okay, so had she not made that car payment, she would have been behind three car payments. So you were behind two payments. She was paying $295, and you were coming up with the other $295 or it—\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I was going to pay. I paid the other one.\nJudge: Alright, so according to you, what happens about a week later?\nPlaintiff: She had an appointment, and I had a doctor's appointment in Jacksonville. It was an appointment that was longstanding, and you really wanted to make it.\nPlaintiff: Yeah. Okay, go ahead.\nPlaintiff: On the way, I had a copy. I wanted her to sign something saying that she received that cash, so I brought— I just typed up something simple saying she got the money, and then also my schedule so we could arrange to share the car when I gave her that information in the car.\nPlaintiff: It was a rage, and proceeded to be a really terrifying car ride.\nJudge: And this was the next day after you gave her the money?\nPlaintiff: No, this was April 19th. It was 10 days after I gave her the money.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Is that accurate? The conversation happens 10 days afterward?\nPlaintiff: Yes, her doctor's appointment was 10 days after it.\nJudge: I do not know that.\nPlaintiff: That was the discussion 10 days later.\nJudge: So according to you, it's 10 days later and she says what?\nPlaintiff: I am not going to let you use the car. Is what she said.\nPlaintiff: Just because you gave her something to sign that says that?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it just went from friendship to full-on rage, and she just started yelling and threatening.\nJudge: What do you think was going on?\nPlaintiff: I think she was trying to intimidate me into backing off and not wanting to get the car as the agreement was.\nJudge: Was there an agreement according to you?\nPlaintiff: There was an agreement that she could use the car.\nJudge: Alright, what didn't you like about the way she was presenting it to you?\nPlaintiff: I was driving in a rainstorm that day, and she kept insisting that I sign an agreement, a written agreement, and I said no.\nJudge: When she pays you the $295, is there any agreement attached to the $295 that she'd be able to use the car?\nPlaintiff: Okay, yes.\nJudge: And then that's what she puts in writing for you to sign. Why are you offended then?\nPlaintiff: How was it put in writing for me to sign? What did she put in writing for you to sign?\nPlaintiff: She wanted me to sign the fact that she gave the receipt that she had given me the money.\nJudge: So then—\nPlaintiff: Okay, you need to tell me what's going on then. What led to the problem? Why did you pull out? Why did you say you can't use my car? What's going on?\nPlaintiff: Okay, I'll tell you.\nDefendant: If it's time, yeah.\nDefendant: Yeah, it's past time. So are barter deals a good idea?\nJudge: Absolutely not. Why?\nDefendant: I'm a hair stylist, and I work hard for my job, so I'm not going to make a deal with you because you just expect it in the end.\nJudge: Again, I'm not sure what that means because you still get something of value if the barter works. What do you think?\nDefendant: I think if you both agree that what you're giving is worth what you're getting, then it should be fine, but you guys have to be on the same page.\nJudge: Yeah, and it's hard being on the same page sometimes.\nDefendant: It's a little loose going inside the courtroom.\nPlaintiff: She'd been using it all of March, right? She lived down just a few miles from me at one point, which was no big deal. She had the car the majority of the time. I was in the hospital part of March anyway. I came home. I can't drive. I am making arrangements to ride the Council on Aging bus to get me to my appointments because I'm a senior, and I'm low income.\nPlaintiff: So you look great.\nDefendant: Thank you.\nPlaintiff: Anyway, she moved to Volano Beach, which was a lot further away.\nDefendant: How much further?\nPlaintiff: It was a good 10 miles away, one way.\nDefendant: Right, and then she would drive back, pick me up.\nJudge: Hold on. When did you move?\nDefendant: April 1st.\nJudge: And it's four— it's four miles. It's not 10 miles.\nJudge: So if she— she moved by the time you got the money for the car payment, which you agree is April 8th.\nDefendant: I don't know when she moved.\nJudge: You don't know?\nDefendant: I don't know.\nDefendant: I know she used my car to move, which was okay because she didn't have any other way to do it. But then it started being appointments in Jacksonville. Then she— her dentist was a good ways away from Volano Beach. Then she was coming to pick me up. It was just getting to be way too much for me to handle, especially with major surgery. I just wasn't— I mean, I just couldn't do it. I was riding a bus. I was walking. My car was with her a lot of the time.\nPlaintiff: Okay, when she offered you a piece of paper and said, \"I want you to sign this,\" there was already hostility between the two of you guys because you felt like she was acting like it's her car?\nDefendant: Yeah.\nJudge: And it's your car?\nDefendant: Yeah.\nPlaintiff: All right.\nDefendant: So do you have an argument in the car that day?\nDefendant: Yes, and yes, we did because she kept on and on. You've got to sign this, and you've got to do this, and you've got to do that. And I'm like, \"I don't have to do anything. I don't even have to take you to Jacksonville,\" and I turned around to take her back home.\nJudge: So you didn't take her to Jacksonville?\nDefendant: I did take her.\nJudge: Yes?\nDefendant: Oh, you did. Wait, so you turned around then?\nDefendant: Yes, three times. I didn’t watch. I thought my husband and I were the only ones who did that.\nPlaintiff: No.\nDefendant: No, this— this was a lot of stray U-turns when there's an argument in the car.\nPlaintiff: It was very scary. She wanted me to get out of the car.\nJudge: Did she tell you to get out?\nDefendant: Yes.\nPlaintiff: Really?\nDefendant: I did because she wouldn't shut her mouth. She almost hit a truck.\nJudge: Well, you're a grown woman. You don't have more anger control than that.\nPlaintiff: You know, it sounds funny now, but no, it's not. It's terrifying then. You're on a highway, and you're sick, and you're going to an appointment, and it's raining. It's not funny, and she just kept on and on. I said, \"I don't have to take you to this appointment.\" Okay, and I turned around not to take her.\nDefendant: But I remembered it was a very important appointment for her.\nJudge: Okay, and then you went ahead and took her?\nDefendant: Yes, we went on to Jacksonville.\nJudge: Did she ever borrow the car after that date?\nDefendant: Never.\nJudge: I don't know. You might not have.\nDefendant: I don't have any— I don’t write down everything I do.\nJudge: So did she try to, and you said no?\nDefendant: She did try to, and I said no.\nJudge: She did try to, and you said no?\nDefendant: I won't loan you the car after that argument in the car and her telling me that she had the right to use the car like it was her car all the time.\nJudge: Right.\nDefendant: And I was upset because there was sunscreen, white sunscreen all over the inside of the car.\nPlaintiff: Because she used it while— no.\nDefendant: You left all your belongings in the car. You borrowed it more times than you ever did. You don't even remember how many. You don't remember how much.\nPlaintiff: Okay, okay.\nDefendant: You're paying for this now, not your good friend anymore.

{"id": "829", "dialogue": "Judge: The defendant has filed a counter suit for $7,000 for lost wages. All parties, please rise. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff gave the defendant a very rare double-headed Indian coin to value it, but he kept it. The defendant says the plaintiff gave him the coin to sell and he could keep anything over $300, and he only made $39. It's the case of \"I Took It on Coin-signment, I Swear.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you. Janina Pagley Arini, you are suing Dan, doing business as The Collector, for $3,500, the value of an Indian gold coin that you say he has kept from you. You have a counterclaim against her for $7,000 in lost wages dealing with this. Let's hear from you first. What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Actually, uh, I had looked online about the cost of the coin to sell it, and I had checked with other parties, and just the weight alone on a 22-karat double-headed gold coin is $500 because I had another party check that.\n\nJudge: Okay. Do you have proof of that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don't have proof, but I went to the American Numismatic, and uh, they had told me that the coin itself, based on the weight, was $500.\n\nJudge: Okay. Do you have proof of that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you show them the coin to get them to give you that estimate?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it is a common coin. And really, I didn't want the money; I just wanted the coin back.\n\nJudge: Okay. I'm sorry, that's the tail end of things. I need to get to the beginning. How did you meet him?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I guess he ran into me because he had seen that I looked online about a coin. So that's when the fishing expedition happened, where he followed me into the coffee shop.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry. You think he found you online and then followed you into a coffee shop?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. Don't laugh, because I go to the coffee shop all the time. I had never seen him in the coffee shop before that time, so I knew that he never frequented that coffee shop until then.\n\nJudge: How did you two meet? He came into that coffee shop and did what?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, he brought coins and put them on a table as bait. And he told me, \"Oh, you have coins.\"\n\nJudge: How would he know that?\n\nPlaintiff: I think it was that I had looked at the value of my coin online.\n\nJudge: Who spoke first?\n\nPlaintiff: I'm not sure.\n\nJudge: Defendant, how did you two meet?\n\nDefendant: She came up to my table at the coffee shop because she saw me reading a trade publication.\n\nJudge: Did you have coins on the table?\n\nDefendant: No. I was reading Coin World newspaper. She asked me if I collected coins, and I said yes, I collect and deal in coins. She said her mother left her some coins, and maybe we'd get together sometime. Then we talked about various subjects—family, politics—for at least a half hour. Then she asked for my card. I gave her my card, and she said when she was ready, she'd call me and show me her coins for appraisal.\n\nDefendant: A month later, she called, and we met in the coffee shop again. She opened up a little box and showed me one coin at a time. Then I saw a $5 gold piece in a plastic holder in the box. I told her it had a retail value of $500. She said, \"Okay, sell it for me.\" She pulled it out and slid it over to me.\n\nJudge: So she told you to sell the coin?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and I told her I'd try to get $500 for it. She said, \"If you get $500, keep $200 for yourself.\" I knew I probably wouldn't get anything over $300, but she agreed that anything over $300 would be mine.\n\nJudge: How did you sell it?\n\nDefendant: I called a few collectors but had no luck. Eventually, I sold it to a dealer friend for $300.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipt?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, according to you, you didn't authorize him to sell it?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I thought $500 would be my bottom price.\n\nJudge: So you did authorize him to sell it but expected him to call before doing so?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and provide me with a receipt.\n\nJudge: Defendant, how did you tell her about the sale?\n\nDefendant: By phone. She then said she didn’t want $300, she wanted $400. Then she said she wanted the coin back, but I told her that wasn’t possible—it had already been sold.\n\nJudge: Why wouldn't you tell her who you sold it to?\n\nDefendant: That’s proprietary information.\n\nPlaintiff: His reputation was already poor online. I checked after he told me he only got $300.\n\nJudge: What did you find?\n\nPlaintiff: The American Numismatic Association told me to report him to the Attorney General.\n\nJudge: Defendant, you have a counterclaim for $7,000 for lost wages. Explain that.\n\nDefendant: By being here, I lost business. I had calls on the way here that I couldn’t take.\n\nJudge: How do you prove that loss?\n\nDefendant: I can’t categorize exactly how much, but it’s based on my income.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, why are you suing for $3,500?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he didn’t provide a proper receipt for the sale.\n\nJudge: I see the receipt he provided. You made an informal deal in a coffee shop. You agreed to let him sell the coin. But you didn’t set a clear bottom price in writing. Judgment for the defendant on the plaintiff’s claim.

{"id": "711", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People's Court. The Plaintiff bought a dump truck from the Defendant, but he says it was a piece of junk. The Defendant says there was no warranty, so tough luck. It's the case of taking a dump.\n\nJudge: Juan Vin Rees, you are suing Frank’s Auto Repair Shop. You’ve asked not to mention your last name or the name of the auto repair shop, but you are suing Frank’s Auto Repair Shop. You are the owner, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: You are suing for $5,000. You say you are actually out more than that because, according to you, they sold you a lemon. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I was looking to buy a dump truck because I was going to start a small business.\n\nJudge: What kind of business?\n\nPlaintiff: A swimming pool business.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I was looking for equipment to start up the business. I looked around everywhere, and I ended up going with him. He had a dump truck for sale for $8,000. So I called him up. He said the truck was great. I went to see it. I drove it, but only around the corner for a very short period of time. He said it was good.\n\nJudge: What did your mechanic say?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I didn’t bring any mechanic. I just went by myself.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: He said that any issues with the truck, he would fix.\n\nJudge: Forever?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, some type of warranty.\n\nJudge: What kind of warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: A 30-day warranty.\n\nJudge: So you have a 30-day warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Is it in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s based on New York State law as well.\n\nJudge: Can I see the warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: Sure.\n\nJudge: So I know what’s warranted and what is not. (Examining document) This is a conditional 30-day warranty or 3,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Where’s the explanation of the warranty?\n\nDefendant: I don’t have one with me.\n\nJudge: Do you give one?\n\nDefendant: We do, but with that being said, we would have covered within that period of time essentially any repair.\n\nJudge: Any repair? That’s more than what New York State law requires.\n\nDefendant: Right. In this scenario, I went beyond.\n\nJudge: Was the truck over 100,000 miles?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So when you sold it, you gave him a 30-day warranty. What goes wrong with the dump truck?\n\nPlaintiff: When I went to register the truck, it started having problems. I went down to register the truck in the middle of March. It wouldn’t start.\n\nJudge: What date did you buy it?\n\nPlaintiff: January 22nd.\n\nJudge: So when did you alert him to a problem?\n\nPlaintiff: February 19th.\n\nJudge: So the truck broke down before you dropped it off again to him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you drive the truck before February 19th?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nDefendant: The truck was dropped off at his home as a courtesy. He wasn’t going to register it for some time due to the seasonal business.\n\nJudge: Then why did you take it for inspection?\n\nPlaintiff: When I was driving it home, it broke down.\n\nJudge: When was that?\n\nPlaintiff: March 10th.\n\nDefendant: We towed it back to my facility in Huntington. It was a fuel pump issue. We replaced it.\n\nJudge: Did you charge him for that?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It broke down again.\n\nDefendant: We towed it again, found another fuel pump needed replacing. We did that, no charge.\n\nJudge: Now we're outside the warranty period?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But you still fixed it for free?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It broke down again on April 11th.\n\nJudge: Mr. Rees, you had a 30-day warranty. It expired. Why do you think you are entitled to a refund?\n\nPlaintiff: I only used the truck one day for work before it broke down.\n\nJudge: But was it before the 30 days expired?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Then you’re outside the warranty.\n\nPlaintiff: But it was a piece of garbage!\n\nJudge: That doesn’t matter. You agreed to the 30-day warranty. That’s your contract. Next time, why not bring a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have any friends who could go.\n\nJudge: You don’t need friends. You need to pay a mechanic. If you can’t afford that, then look at what happens. The cheap comes out expensive.\n\nJudge: Your problems happened after the 30 days. End of story. Verdict for the Defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t think it was fair. I only used the truck one day.\n\nDefendant: We try to do the right thing for all our customers, but you can’t make everyone happy.\n\nJudge: Everybody talks about warranties as if they’re etched in stone.

At the time, she was 4 and a half.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you heard him say that?\n\nWitness: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: And did you say that?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: So can you actually threaten someone with physical harm? Not hitting them or anything, but threatening them if they refuse to pay a loan back and, uh, and you're entitled to get the money?\n\nPlaintiff (interrupting): I don’t see anything wrong in that.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t. I think...\n\nJudge (interrupting): What do you say?\n\nPlaintiff: I like turtles.\n\nJudge: Um... would you guys think that it’s okay to threaten somebody with physical harm in order to get a loan paid?\n\nAudience: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, violence isn’t the answer.\n\nAudience: Yes, it is illegal.\n\nJudge: It’s also illegal, but we’ll explain going inside the courtroom. Are there any recordings of this?\n\nPlaintiff: She has the detective.\n\nJudge: May I hear the tape?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have the tape.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you have the tape?\n\nPlaintiff: Because the detective did not get back to me.\n\nPlaintiff: But I do have a paper stating that he does have the DVD.\n\nJudge: You have a paper?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have the complaint.\n\nJudge: That’s right there, voicemail message, that has the voicemail message that they put on. Can I have the whole police report?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s all that I have.\n\nJudge: That’s all they gave?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why is this all that you have?\n\nPlaintiff: Because the detective was unavailable the time yesterday when I went there and I called several times. He didn’t return my call.\n\nJudge: She was being threatened by Bernal Ramirez because she owed him money. C statement, that statement right there. This statement right here. This that starts off with, “I owe Bernal Ramirez some money.”\n\nPlaintiff: It was supposed to say \"I owed...\"\n\nJudge: \"I owe Bernal Ramirez some money.\" Does that sound like a mistake?\n\nDefendant: Right. That was a mistake.\n\nJudge: Does that sound like a mistake to you, Teresa?\n\nJudge: You can say it. We all know what you're thinking.\n\nWitness: She did say she owed him.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, she did say she owed him, and... oh, wait, wait, wait, let’s go with that.\n\nJudge: So that was the first thing. Stop a second. She owed him money. What did you say?\n\nPlaintiff: I wrote that out for her.\n\nJudge: Oh, so you’re in on this too?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no, no, I wrote this for her.\n\nJudge: So you know that she’s perjuring herself now when she says, “I never borrowed money from him.”\n\nDefendant: I don’t know where he's getting this from.\n\nJudge: But you did say you owed him money. What does that mean? You paid it?\n\nDefendant: I mean, that’s what it would mean to me.\n\nJudge: What does it mean?\n\nDefendant: You tell me.\n\nJudge: That’s what owed means to me.\n\nDefendant: That’s what it would mean.\n\nJudge: So then why would you stand here and perjure yourself 10 seconds ago and say, \"I never borrowed money from him?\"\n\nDefendant: I don’t know where he’s getting this from, but I’m not perjuring myself because I’ve never borrowed $1,500 from him. The most I ever gave or took from him was about $40, and that he came over to my house and made soup. I never went to his house, sat there and talked to him like we were old friends because I don’t want any part of...\n\nJudge: Why did you write a restraining order?\n\nDefendant: Because he was threatening my family.\n\nJudge: That is why you’d write...\n\nDefendant: He threatened my family because he’s a crazy person.\n\nJudge: Why did you write, “He’s threatening my family because I owe him money that he let me borrow”?\n\nDefendant: If in fact, you didn’t owe him money that he let you borrow, see, I’m only here about the owing money that he let you borrow. That’s what I’m here about. I’m here to find out if he’s telling the truth or if you’re telling the truth.\n\nJudge: How do you think it’s looking?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it doesn’t look too good for me.\n\nJudge: It doesn’t?\n\nDefendant: It doesn’t.\n\nJudge: It doesn’t look too good for you, honestly.\n\nDefendant: Yeah, sure.\n\nJudge: $1,500.

{"id": "466", "dialogue": "**Plaintiff:** This is the plaintiff, Tanisha May. She says she hired the defendant to drive her to work, and they got into an argument in the parking lot. When she went to open the car door, the defendant hit a pillar, and the door swung back into her wrist, injuring it. What the defendant did to her wasn't right. She had to go to a doctor, suffered pain, and is suing for the $5,000 that the defendant owes her.\n\n**Defendant:** This is the defendant, Victor Janua. He says the plaintiff opened her door while he was driving and slammed it into a concrete pillar, then started a ruckus about her hurt hand. If anything did indeed happen to the plaintiff's hand, it was her own fault. He did nothing wrong.\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please rise.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas. Tanisha May?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, hi.\n\n**Judge:** You are suing Victor Janua, correct? And Alaji Ba for $5,000 in medical bills and pain and suffering that you say you suffered at the hands of Victor, who was driving Alaji's car. All right, what's going on?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, um, back in August, I called Reliable Cab to send me a cab. They were an hour and a half late—no, sorry, a half hour late sending me a cab. When Victor arrived, yes, I was angry, but it was nothing directed towards him personally, like attacking him. He's going back and forth with me, and—\n\n**Judge:** Going back and forth how?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Just commenting back on what I'm saying.\n\n**Judge:** What is he saying?\n\n**Plaintiff:** All right, so I had told him that the dispatcher sent me a cab for me. He was like, \"No, if that's true, why would he tell me to pick up another person?\" I'm like, \"I just got off the phone with him.\" He was like, \"Well, you're probably lying.\" Not \"probably lying,\" but he just said, \"Oh, that's not true. He told me to pick up another fare.\" So, I'm angry, so I made a statement about the car being cheap, and then he was like, \"Oh, but you're walking though.\" Like, he was just going back and forth with me for no reason. Well, not for no reason, but nothing that I was saying was directed towards him, but he was taking it personally.\n\n**Judge:** The car was cheap? Okay, go on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, we dropped the first passenger off. As we're driving to my—\n\n**Judge:** Driving to your car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I'm sorry, driving to my job. I'm sorry.\n\n**Judge:** Your job. Okay. And you work where?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Target.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So before we got to my job, I couldn’t tell him that I needed to get cash from the ATM.\n\n**Judge:** Why not?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because we were going back and forth with each other.\n\n**Judge:** Why didn’t you do that instead of going back and forth? If you knew you had no money to pay for the fare, why were you going back and forth?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That's another thing. I didn’t have money. When I checked my wallet, I was short. So, I was like, \"Okay, I have to go inside to get cash.\" Plus, it was like 5-something in the morning, so no stores were open. Target has an ATM, so I'm like, \"Since I'm going to Target, do you mind if I run inside to get cash?\" He's like, \"Oh, no, you’re trying to play games with me.\" The door was already open. He drives off. He's driving at a speed where I couldn’t even try to close the door because he’s swerving and stuff. I have a witness, but she couldn’t attend today nor could she provide a written statement, but she was there. She saw everything and even heard the door hit the cement pillar in the parking lot.\n\n**Judge:** So the door opened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Mm-hmm.\n\n**Judge:** And hit a cement pillar?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** And then what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He drove me home, and that was it.\n\n**Judge:** Why are you suing?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because I got injured. My wrist got injured.\n\n**Judge:** How?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I guess the way the door hit the cement pillar and the way it shut—my wrist was swollen.\n\n**Judge:** Was your wrist on the inside of the car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was on the inside of the car, but the door was still open. So when he was driving through the lane, there was a cement pillar to the right. He was going at a fast speed, so it shut hard against my wrist.\n\n**Judge:** Was there damage to the door?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I'm not sure. He hit the door and kept going. He never stopped.\n\n**Judge:** If it caused $5,000 worth of injury to your wrist, there had to have been damage to the door. There should be damage to the door.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, yeah, when you put it that way, true. But I'm not too sure if there was damage to the car. When I got out of the car, I didn’t look. I just went back into my house and called for another cab.\n\n**Judge:** Did you go to the hospital?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** What time?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t recall exactly. Maybe later that night.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have hospital records?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I do.\n\n**Judge:** May I see them?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Sure.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Janua, can you tell me what happened?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, Your Honor. Like she said, it all started when I picked her up. She was complaining that she was late for work. I explained that I take people from point A to point B. I can’t control what the dispatcher is doing. I had another passenger going in the same direction, so I picked him up. She was complaining about that. When we got to her job, she told me she needed to go inside to use the ATM. I said, \"You can’t use the ATM at 4:30 in the morning.\" I told her, \"I feel like you’re playing me. I’m taking you back home.\" She never opened the door until I was leaving the parking lot. That’s when she slammed the door into the concrete pillar and hurt her own wrist.\n\n**Judge:** My verdict in this case is for the defendant.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, exaggeration, evasion, persuasion, framing the narrative"}

{"id": "72", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Michael Gordano. He says he was looking for a tenant, and the defendant, a real estate broker, found him a tenant. He guaranteed the rent every month from the tenant. The woman didn’t pay, and the defendant owes him the $5,000 he’s now out because he relied on him and his guarantee.\n\nThis is the defendant, James Fauler. He says he found the plaintiff a Section 8 tenant, and that means the rent’s guaranteed to be paid. If Section 8 stopped paying rent to him, that’s on him and his relationship with Section 8. Maybe he didn’t make repairs to the apartment or something. Bottom line, he’s not responsible and says the plaintiff is suing the wrong person. He’s accused of finding a real bad tenant.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff asked the defendant, a real estate broker, to find him a tenant, and the tenant ended up stiffing him. He wants the defendant to make it right. But the defendant says it’s not his problem. It’s the case of ‘Get Real.’\n\nThank you, Douglas. Mr. Gordano, you are suing Mr. Fauler, your real estate agent, for $5,000, the statutory maximum, because according to you, he got you a tenant that didn’t work out.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: This tenant that he guaranteed to me—he suggested I take her as a makeup tenant for the previous tenant that he got me, who destroyed my place half a year earlier. He said I should take her as a makeup because her money is guaranteed. And after five months of paying—\n\nJudge: What do you mean as a makeup?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, he got me the previous tenant, who destroyed my place and left it in shambles.\n\nJudge: How is that his fault? Just because he was the broker in the transaction?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, he got me the tenant. He said it was a great young couple guaranteed by the boss, the former landlord. I said okay, and a couple of months later, they were fighting and destroyed my place.\n\nJudge: But how is that his fault?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I got the tenant from his recommendation.\n\nJudge: Okay, but who pays his fee? You or the tenant?\n\nPlaintiff: I think the tenant does.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then he gets you this tenant in question, and this tenant was somebody who was leaving Section 8, correct? Had you ever dealt with Section 8 before?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but I had heard that they’re good to deal with because their money is guaranteed.\n\nJudge: Well, they could be great. They could be a terrible pain. It just kind of depends. They have to approve it beforehand. If something’s not to their liking, they won’t pay the rent, etc. So you enter into an agreement with both her and Section 8, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I prepared the place for this second tenant. It passed inspection, she moved in, and she paid for five months. Then all of a sudden, Section 8 cut off her assistance.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: They said they discovered that she has other income, so they stopped paying for her.\n\nJudge: So did she get a job and her circumstances changed?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she got a second job.\n\nJudge: So when they found out she got a second job, they said, ‘You can pay your rent, and we don’t need to help you. There are other people we have to help.’ So they stopped paying. What’s the agreement that you, as a landlord, enter into with Section 8? That they have to pay for a whole year?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, they said that they are—\n\nJudge: Let me see your Section 8 paperwork.\n\nPlaintiff: (Hands document to judge)\n\nJudge: Oh, well, this is a notice of ender payment change or termination. They reduced her payments.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, they reduced her payments, and so she was supposed to be paying more of the rent.\n\nJudge: And then she said, ‘I can’t afford this place.’ Did she move out?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she squatted for four months. It’s on the second floor of my house, so I observed and heard people coming in and socializing in my second floor as they were squatting. I said, ‘When are you going to pay the rent?’ She said, ‘I’ll pay the rent as soon as I can.’\n\nJudge: Is she still there? Why don’t you just evict her?\n\nPlaintiff: I did. It cost me the sheriff’s eviction expense.\n\nJudge: That’s what everybody has to do. All of us mere mortals have to go to landlord-tenant court.\n\nPlaintiff: I did. I went through the process of evicting her, and that took four months.\n\nJudge: Oh, but you got her out now?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, that was my question. You’re not helpless. So how do you figure that Mr. Fauler owes you a guarantee on a tenant that he gets you?\n\nDefendant: I never personally guaranteed anything.\n\nJudge: Did you act as a personal guarantor on a tenant for this gentleman?\n\nDefendant: No, your honor.\n\nJudge: Have you ever guaranteed a tenant’s payment?\n\nDefendant: No, your honor.\n\nJudge: Then why does he think that you did?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know, your honor.\n\nJudge: So, Mr. Gordano, you’re saying that because the defendant said ‘Section 8 means guaranteed money,’ you took that as a personal guarantee from him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: That’s not how it works.

And so, you sold it to him, and he was going to make you payments?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: He didn’t pay you upfront?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he gave me $100 down and was supposed to give me $100 out of each paycheck, and he didn’t do it.\n\nJudge: Right. One thing you said in your complaint was, “I covered my butt every which way.”\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Because on my bill of sale, I made sure it said, “As is.

More than two months. And you decided that you’d give them a toaster oven, and they would make do?\n\nDefendant: Well, that was my sister’s—what she decided.\n\nJudge: Then your sister's a jerk. Kind of. Because you can’t really do that.\n\nDefendant: Okay.   and saying, \"This is good enough for the likes of you,\" I am ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $200 as a rent rebate.\n\nJudge: That happened on Thanksgiving, so it's about a month and a half that you were without an oven. What's that worth? Kind of depends if you cook or not. I'm going to order the defendants to rebate rent to the tune of $200.\n\nJudge: So there's a net judgment in favor of the plaintiff in this case, not of $5,000 but of $200.\n\nJudge: On your counterclaim, for the reasons I've explained, zero.\n\nDefendant: That’s kind of a cheap shot, don’t you think?\n\nJudge: You handed them a toaster oven instead of fixing the problem.\n\nDefendant: We didn’t mean to make it sound like that.\n\nJudge: Well, it certainly did.\n\nDefendant: We pulled them out of the homeless shelter to rent to them, and obviously, we just tried to help them.\n\nJudge: It didn’t work.\n\nDefendant: The tenant next to me was homeless. I gave her a home eight years ago, and she’s paid rent every single month. Never been a day of trouble.\n\nJudge: Well, okay. Thank you very much.\n\n(Defendant exits.)\n\nJudge (to Plaintiff): Sorry about that. That’s the way it goes.\n\nPlaintiff: Lord willing, it happened like it happened.\n\nJudge: Sounds like this was a whole mess. Are you okay now? Where are you living now?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m blessed.

{"id": "846", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Ms. Smith, you are suing your former landlord and friend Ms. Rothenberg for $3,000 that you say she owes you as a result of putting your stuff out.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, during my tenancy.\n\n**Judge:** Tell me what happened there.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, I was looking to move. I didn’t really like where I was living, I felt uncomfortable. At the time, we were really good friends.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So then, she was like, “Hey, I’m renting out the downstairs part of my house, do you know someone who wants to rent it?” And I’m like, “Oh, I’ll find someone.” But I ended up being the person to rent the downstairs part of the house.\n\n**Judge:** How much was your rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $700.\n\n**Judge:** And how did it go at the beginning?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was fine, it was really fine at the beginning.\n\n**Judge:** And the first problem you had with her was when? What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The first altercation had to be the day that we put food on the grill. This was literally—I can’t even tell you the problem. But like I said, if she needed help putting food on the grill, closed mouths don’t get fed. If you need help, you can ask for help. I don’t know how to cook on a grill, so I’m not going to say, “Oh, let me put food on a grill.” I don’t know how to cook on a grill.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, now how does that translate to her putting your stuff out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That was just the first one. From there, stuff was just never right. It was just always weird after that.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so let’s get to when it starts to get really bad, which is by October. Did you pay the entire rent for October?\n\n**Plaintiff:** This is what we came to—she said you can pay it weekly or you can just pay the full $700.\n\n**Judge:** When did she say that to you? What was happening?\n\n**Plaintiff:** My boyfriend and I were leaving the house one day, and she was like, “Hey, can I talk to you for a second?” I’m like, “Yeah.” So I go over, and she was talking to me. She said, “We all have to be out by November 1st.” This was probably like the beginning of October.\n\n**Judge:** Why did you have to be out by November 1st?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The lease was ending, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** So you weren’t being evicted?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Did you pay the rent for October to the landlord?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I did.\n\n**Judge:** Go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So I said, “Okay, I’ll pay it weekly,” because I was barely there. When my apartment was ready, I was going to move out. I wanted to find an apartment. So I gave her the money for two weeks and then just that one week.\n\n**Judge:** How much did you give her?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I gave her $300, and then I was just going to give her the rest for the other two weeks.\n\n**Judge:** That’s not half though.\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, not half. But I gave her some of the money, which was—I think it was just like, what, $50 off? It was supposed to be like $350.\n\n**Judge:** But then when the time came, you also didn’t pay the rest.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I told her—I was going to give it to her once I got my check. It wasn’t a problem before.\n\n**Judge:** It’s a problem now because you guys aren’t getting along. So what happens? You don’t have the rent in the middle of the month. What happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** We got into an altercation about me washing clothes. Some of my boyfriend’s stuff was mixed in with mine.\n\n**Judge:** She got mad that you were doing your boyfriend’s laundry in the house?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was my laundry and his together, and then I get a text message saying, “You have the audacity to wash clothes in my house. You didn’t pay the rest of the rent.”\n\n**Judge:** Can I see those texts?\n\n**Defendant:** I asked her to move her stuff to clean, and she didn’t. Later that night, I saw her washing her boyfriend’s clothes. I texted her about it.\n\n**Judge:** But then you put her stuff outside. You can’t do that.\n\n**Defendant:** I set it outside.\n\n**Judge:** Where?\n\n**Defendant:** Near the garage, outside, uncovered.\n\n**Judge:** That’s an illegal lockout. You can’t do that.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It rained. My stuff was ruined.\n\n**Defendant:** It didn’t rain for eight days after I put it out.\n\n**Judge:** That doesn’t matter. You had no right to do that. I am ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff $500 for the furniture and $75 for the mattress, for a total of $575. Verdict for the plaintiff.\n\n**Defendant:** I didn’t think about it being illegal.\n\n**Judge:** Well, you should have. You broke the law. You got off easy.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s not about the money, it’s the principle. My stuff should never have been touched.\n\n**Judge:** Case closed.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization,deflection"}
{"id": "223", "dialogue": "Plaintiff: Yes\nJudge: You are suing Runway Towing Corporation, represented here by Shadu Branch. You're the field supervisor correct?\nDefendant: Yes\nJudge: Ma'am for $4,125 in damages that you say you incurred because they inappropriately towed your car?\nPlaintiff: Yes\nJudge: All right what happened?\nPlaintiff: Okay so on um 12/19 at around 9:00 p.m., um I parked the car across the street from fourth drive.\nJudge: Why?\nPlaintiff: Um I parked it there because I was going upstairs to visit family. I was bringing some presents.\nJudge: You live there right?\nPlaintiff: No, was like the holiday season. Um I had spent the night. When I got back up um the next day at around 1:00 when I went outside I noticed that the car wasn't there so I started to freak out a bit. I'm like okay so where's the car.\nJudge: Where did you park?\nPlaintiff: I parked um across the street um I have it entered as evidence um there are a lot of driveways in that street um but the section there was a tree on the tree it says not to block driveways really big.    Judge: On the tree there's a sign this big... you block that person's driveway?\nPlaintiff: Well it doesn't say... it says don't block driveways, it doesn't say you can't park in front of the tree.\nJudge: So the tree has... if half of your car is not blocking the person's driveway were you blocking the driveway?\nPlaintiff: Half of my car wasn't blocking the driveway... of it was I don't believe... I thought that I cleared it.\nJudge: So it was late at night but you didn't... you were partially in the driveway sufficiently to have gotten ticketed correct?\nPlaintiff: So yes there was a summons when I went to pick up the car.\nJudge: But the problem that you have is that nobody's telling you correct? You're trying to find out where your car is and the usual channels are not coming up according to you?\nPlaintiff: So there's two problems, main problems that I have. So the first problem is when I went outside like you said the car was missing so I called 311. They told me that there's a possibility that the car could have been towed so if the car was towed that I need to call my local precinct which is the 107. So I made that phone call, they told me that I needed... I have the officers who I spoke to, they told me that I needed to wait because what happens is when a car is towed it has to be issued a summons and they have to enter it into a tow log whichever tow company takes it.\nJudge: That's two different ways that the city of New York records what occurred. One is that you there should be a record of your ticket, yes, and the other is that there must be whenever there's a tow a record of the tow so that people know... people and the police know should we be looking for a stolen car or did this car get towed and I need to get it before I rack up a bunch of storage charges?\nPlaintiff: Absolutely. So when I was making these phone calls I just keep hearing over and over that there's no record of the tow, there's no record of the tow.\nJudge: Is this a recording or is this you speaking to different officers?\nPlaintiff: This is me speaking to different officers. So officers they're actually talking to me telling me that there's no evidence of a tow and I have all the shield numbers of everybody who I contacted and spoke to. So um I spoke to the officers, they're telling me that there's nothing. So now the next day um on the Monday on 12/21 at 7:20 I spoke to officer um Olivo, she told me that there were no updates.\nJudge: When are they reporting it as stolen at some point?\nPlaintiff: Well this is the morning that I called because now they're saying okay you need to report the car um stolen. So now at this point I'm like now it's 2 days later you have no evidence of a ticket.      Judge: But that's not uncommon because it sometimes takes a bit for the ticket to go through.\nPlaintiff: I could agree with you absolutely but you have no evidence of the tow.\nJudge: So do you report the car stolen?\nPlaintiff: I did. So I'm checking on the um NYC server website um I have a screenshot of the of the 20th the last time that I had the very very last time that I checked it the 20th of of January cuz that's when it was finally reported to me that it was with this company but prior to that every day I'm checking online nothing else is popping up.\nJudge: How did you find out that Runway Towing had... is it Runway or Runway?\nDefendant: Runway.\nJudge: How did you find out that Runway Towing had towed your car? When did you finally find out and how?\nPlaintiff: Okay so um it was just like the weirdest thing so I get this phone call and it's from my lienholder.\nJudge: The lienholder being the bank?\nPlaintiff: Yes, Capital One. So what they said to me was basically these are the people who have your car um if you do not pick up the car then um there's a possibility that they could keep the car. I don't know it just seemed very strange so I didn't know where this phone call was coming why it was that I was getting this phone call from the lienholder.\nJudge: What is the procedure when you tow a car?\nDefendant: We are not allowed to tow a car for Block driveway until a ticket is issued by the police department. The ticket... so you actually got the call not by the police department but by the home... from the homeowner.\nJudge: Do you guys have a policy of taking a picture of the car where it's parked?\nDefendant: Uh we do.\nJudge: Can I see it?\nDefendant: This is where she parked that that's the little space that...\nJudge: No no I want a picture of the empty space. Do you have a picture of her car blocking the driveway was what I...\nDefendant: No I do not. The only proof I have of that is that the ticket was issued by the police officer.   Judge: No I know I just like to see it. I see how bad it was. There's no space. I like to see how bad she wanted to see her relatives if somebody else couldn't go see theirs. That's what I was trying to see.\nDefendant: There's driveways everywhere in this neighborhood. I mean my that sign could not be bigger. The sign's like a foot and a half there. No space to park there. It's a yellow mark on the sidewalk that says do not park there. The space is about this big. You can't put a car there so if you park a car there you're going to be blocking not only one but two.\nJudge: Wow that would have to be...\nDefendant: Yeah you it would have to be a golf cart, a golf cart to park there because no matter how you can... you cannot park there without blocking both driveways.\nJudge: Wow. Okay so then what happens?\nDefendant: Uh she... she said that it was no foul. She when she came not spoke to me I did my own investigation to make sure that we wasn't in the wrong so I went to the precinct and I also found where we wrote in the log book and where the...\nJudge: Let me see that and see if yours is better but I have that page and show me where you wrote in the log book.\nDefendant: What I see is a piece of paper covering the log book. We're not allowed to write in the log book. We give it to the police office, the desk officer right and then the police officer wrote in the log book.\nJudge: He has to staple it or write it in the log book. Listen to me - are you going to show me a picture of where the police officer wrote in the log book?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: When is this picture taken?\nDefendant: That's taken 2 days after I spoke when she came to the office and said that it wasn't in the log book.

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says his lifelong friend stiffed him on a trip to Miami, backed out, and won’t pay the cancellation fee. But the defendant says the plaintiff jumped the gun before the defendant committed. It’s the case of \"Life of Miami Beach.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Patrick Hemingway, you're suing Jamal Cooper, your former friend, for $900 in cancellation fees that you incurred as a result of him bailing on you, according to you. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: All right, so we all planned—me, Jamal, and another friend—to go to Miami for spring break weekend. We all were in a group chat, and I told them that we had a good deal on a hotel and flight, so I had to pay it by a certain day. Both parties knew. Me and the other friend had got the money together, and we were waiting for Jamal to send the money, but we had to book by that day, so I went ahead and booked the trip.\n\nJudge: But did you have his authority to do that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I spoke to him on the phone, and he's also in the group chat. After the trip was booked, I sent the itinerary. After that, he said, \"Could I just give you cash?\" So he knew it was completely booked, and he was going to give me cash. I told him yeah.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: A couple of days went past. He was supposed to give me the money. We spoke on the phone again, and he told me like, he’s not going. He didn’t know I already booked the trip. Then I responded to that message, telling him everything that he said, and he didn’t respond to my texts or calls.\n\nJudge: You’ve never talked to him since then?\n\nPlaintiff: I haven’t talked to him since then.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you and your other friend end up going anyway?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, we had to cancel and rebook.\n\nJudge: Right, but you’re going to have to prove to me you paid $900 in cancellation fees.\n\nPlaintiff: I can prove it.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. So this is from United Vacations, what they sent over saying about the refund. It was $300 per person. United Vacations canceled. How did you get this?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, they emailed it to me.\n\nJudge: Can I see the email that they sent you that shows that it came from them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And while he's looking for that, what’s your story?\n\nDefendant: He knew—everybody knows that I’m a supervisor at my job. I’m salaried, it’s hard to get days off. Him and my other friend both knew that. The other friend knew that, that’s why he ain’t suing me. He knows.\n\nJudge: What did you tell him? Did you tell him, \"Go ahead and make the reservation?\"\n\nDefendant: No, I did not. He’s saying that. He is telling me he got a nice deal, whatever, whatever. He never told me to—I never said, \"Pay for the trip.\"\n\nJudge: Did he tell you, \"Look, today’s the deadline, we’ve got to pay\"? And did you say, \"Yeah, okay, do it?\"\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So now you’ve been able to prove to me that you’re out the money. So the next question is: Show me that it’s his fault that you’re out the money. In other words, show me the conversations that you have with him where he says, \"Yeah, go for it. I’m in.\"\n\nPlaintiff: All right. I can go to the texts.\n\nJudge: You need your phone, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, and set it so it won’t be scrambled.\n\nJudge: Because it’s simple—you either agreed to do this and then left him hanging, or you didn’t agree to do this.\n\nDefendant: Right. I said I wanted to go. I never said, \"Go ahead, pay for the trip.\"\n\nJudge: Let’s see. Let’s see how the language starts on January 22nd. Okay, hand it over.\n\nJudge: I spend my life scrolling. I have arthritis in my right thumb.\n\nJudge: What is the day that you had to pay the money?\n\nPlaintiff: I believe the 22nd of January.\n\nJudge: There’s not a single text from him agreeing to pay? You’re texting him, but he’s not answering?\n\nPlaintiff: We spoke on the phone. I have our call log too.\n\nJudge: All right. But you don’t have texts proving that he authorized you to spend. But after it was booked, he—you can see where he agreed to send the money over several times.\n\nJudge: So then you don’t have a text proving he authorized it beforehand. But he does say, \"Can’t I just give you the cash?\" Why would he say that if he didn’t think he owed you the cash?\n\nDefendant: That was before my job said I couldn’t go.\n\nJudge: Oh, well, then that’s on you, isn’t it? Then maybe what you should have been saying to him was, \"Absolutely not, don’t include me because I have to first check with my job.\"\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff. $900.\n\nDefendant: Nobody told him to pay for that.\n\nJudge: Your mothers must be so upset at you.

Okay, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, basically, I moved into Miss Davis' apartment on April 3rd.\n\nJudge: Of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2015.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So, it’s a split-level house, and she lived in the front, and I lived in the back.\n\nJudge: All right, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Basically, when I moved in, I told her that I had a fish tank and a turtle at the time. I did upgrade. I had a 10-gallon tank, and I upgraded to a 55-gallon.\n\nDefendant: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Is that allowed?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it is.\n\nDefendant: She claimed that I changed the fish tank water every day. That’s not true. I had four kids—13, 11, 7, and 4. They constantly used the bathroom. She basically told me that I couldn’t flush the toilet every day. She was complaining about the water bill.\n\nJudge: Her water bill went up, and she was paying that, so she was mad at you?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: How much was Section 8 paying?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,250.\n\nJudge: And then you were paying how much?\n\nPlaintiff: Nothing, the rent was $1,250.\n\nJudge: That’s what I was trying to figure out. So, your lease should have taken you through what month in a year?\n\nPlaintiff: A year, so April 2016.\n\nJudge: And when did you move out?\n\nPlaintiff: July 31st, 2016.\n\nJudge: So, you stayed month to month. When you moved out, what condition did you leave the place in?\n\nPlaintiff: I left it immaculate.\n\nJudge: Did you take pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Did you take video?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: According to you, you are refusing to return the security deposit because she left the place damaged?\n\nDefendant: Yes, she did.\n\nJudge: Did you take pictures?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Did you take video?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: Okay, according to you, you left it clean. Let me see your pictures and your video.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, I also have the apartment checklist. I cleaned the whole apartment. She never cleaned it before I moved in.\n\nJudge: Section 8 wouldn’t let you move in unless they did an inspection first.\n\nDefendant: True.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you a question. What are the damages that caused you to keep the entire security deposit?\n\nDefendant: I have pictures.\n\nJudge: Can I see them?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you submit all the pictures into evidence?\n\nDefendant: I did.\n\nJudge: Hold on and let me see if I’ve got them here. Okay, what’s this a picture of?\n\nDefendant: This is the corner molding of the house outside.\n\nJudge: And according to you, it was that way when you got it?\n\nPlaintiff: We had a big snowstorm. After that snowstorm, that’s what resulted when the snow melted. It wasn’t my fault.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Let’s move on to the next picture.\n\n(Conversation continues analyzing damages, claims, and counterclaims.)\n\nJudge: I’m looking at the receipts and pictures. I’m making a decision. Some things you can clearly prove happened during her care, and some things you cannot. Did she do anything deliberate to damage the place?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: What did she do deliberately?\n\nDefendant: When she left, the entire place smelled like smoke and urine.\n\nJudge: Did you spread urine around the place?\n\nPlaintiff: No! My witness cleaned the whole apartment before I left. Here’s the exit checklist.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof you contacted Section 8?\n\nPlaintiff: I did email her.\n\nJudge: May I see the email?\n\nPlaintiff: I can go look for it.\n\nJudge: Forget it. I’m calculating the damages and making my ruling.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "exaggeration, deflection, gaslighting"}
{"id": "733", "dialogue": "Judge: Emmy Vega. Yes, you are suing Leon Brown for a $1,000 deposit that you want returned to you because you did not actually move in. Tell me what happened here.\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Okay, so, um, my whole family had kind of got evicted, and we couldn't afford to live together anymore, so we kind of all just separated. I came straight out of high school, and I didn’t have a job. I have credit—\n\nJudge: Wait, wait, you had just graduated from high school?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yeah, I—me.\n\nJudge: How many of you were living together when you got evicted?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Five of us.\n\nJudge: Okay, so it was your mom?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): It was my mom.\n\nJudge: Is this your mom?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yes.\n\nJudge: You and who else?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): My two brothers and my grandma.\n\nJudge: And who's the gentleman who's here?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): This is my boyfriend.\n\nJudge: So, everybody had to separate, and what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): I started trying to figure out where to live. I first was going to live with my brother, but that didn’t work out, so I decided to try to find a room to rent out. And because I didn’t have credit and I didn’t have a job, most people, they didn’t want to even look in my direction. So I found an ad, and I contacted multiple people, and Leon was the one who responded to me. We made a contract saying that I would live there for three months. Two months' rent would be $500, and the third month would be free. So, I gave him $1,000 in cash, and I have a receipt that we both signed.\n\nJudge: And where were you going to live in their place?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Um, in their room.\n\nJudge: In their room?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yes.\n\nJudge: How come? Like, that's kind of peculiar.\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Um, so, um, on the meeting of her coming to my apartment to see the place still was the option of her staying in the room with us or having her own private room. But the private room cost more.\n\nJudge: Who is living in there?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): There was nobody.\n\nJudge: Well, actually, you're going to have her move into your room?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): So, I mean, that's a little peculiar, isn’t it? Because you were hoping to rent that out to someone else for more?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Yeah.\n\nJudge: So there's a perfectly good empty room, but she is paying to live inside the same room that you two are using. How? Where was she going to sleep?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Well, um, I was offering her—there was an air mattress. An air mattress, so she could sleep on the air mattress in your room.\n\nJudge: Correct. That's not going to afford you a lot of privacy, is it?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Well, the—um, honestly, the only reason that I actually chose to assist her is because of her situation. If it wasn’t anything else, then I would have never suggested it.\n\nJudge: Okay, I'm taking it from the fact that you can’t let go of her hand—that’s your girlfriend, right?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so how did you feel about that?\n\nDefendant’s girlfriend (Leon’s girlfriend): Not great.\n\nJudge: So would you ever, you know, in a desperate situation, move in with a boyfriend and girlfriend, and they're together and live in the same room? What do you say?\n\nDefendant’s girlfriend (Leon’s girlfriend): No, definitely not.\n\nJudge: What would the option be that's better than that if you're really desperate?\n\nDefendant’s girlfriend (Leon’s girlfriend): I wouldn’t be that desperate. I'd go back home.\n\nJudge: Well, that’s a good one. Go back home.\n\nJudge: What do you say?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Um, no, we share a room, boyfriend, girlfriend here. Uh, I would not want to be that third person in a room.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, was that a warning going inside the courtroom?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Alright, so what happens? You hand over $1,000, and then what happened? Where'd you get the $1,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Um, um, we had got into a car accident, me and my brother, my mom, and she had sued, um, not sure for how much.\n\nJudge: So you hand over $1,000, and what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Um, I think four days before I was supposed to move in, my mom had informed me that they were going to clear out the apartment, 'cause it was supposed to be an eviction. So everything was kind of done in a rush. Um, so I asked him if I could move my stuff in, and I did. So I decided that that—like not at the moment—but I, um, eventually…\n\nJudge: Come on, come on.\n\nPlaintiff’s mom: No, no, right there. Right there.\n\nJudge: Sorry. You go over to help her move in?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yes.\n\nJudge: And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): First of all, as I walk in, there's a whole bunch of suitcases lined up on the stairs, on the steps to go up, and the smell of cat urine was unbearable. I just told her, \"You cannot stay here. You cannot stay here.\" So, what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): But it was her decision.\n\nJudge: You folks end up calling the police?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yeah.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Uh, they went upstairs. They talked to both of us, and they said that this is a civil matter for court, and at that moment, they suggested that he write up a contract for a refund.\n\nJudge: They suggested that you write up a contract for a refund?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yes.\n\nJudge: And who wrote up the contract?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Leon did.\n\nJudge: And we both agreed to it.\n\nJudge: Okay, and does anybody have a copy of the contract?\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): I do. I have, um, crude pictures.\n\nJudge: I apologize.\n\nJudge: That's better than not having anything. And you have the contract itself? Let's see it.\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Yeah, this is my copy.\n\nJudge: Let’s see your crude pictures.\n\nPlaintiff (Amy Vega): Who types this up? You do?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): I typed it up.\n\nJudge: Okay, on October 28th, I, Leon Brown, have agreed to return her money, which she paid to me on October 17th in a payment agreement since Amy Vega is insisting on the return of her thousand on this date, three full days before the terms of the contract were supposed to begin. Both parties, Amy Vega and myself, are agreeing that the aforementioned housing contract is completely null and void and hereby terminated. Well, that's an interesting twist of events. I will agree to start paying Amy Vega back on December 1st. Did you pay her on December 1st?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay. I will pay her $200 a month until the entire $1,000 is returned by registered money order mailed to PO box. In conclusion, Amy Vega, nor anyone affiliated with her, shall not have any personal contact with me or come near my property.\n\nJudge: So, my dear, why am I here? Explain it to me.\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): Because you appear to have already signed something saying that in return for taking monthly payments and in return for leaving peacefully, you are going to return her money.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): So, based on—so that you authored, what happened?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): So on the day of the signing of the contract, I took—I took what she wrote on my copy of the contract as a form of insult and sort of as a threat, as in like that whoever she’s not responsible for whoever, but I feel—\n\nJudge: Has anybody come to your place and threatened you?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): I—I haven’t.\n\nJudge: Okay, so then if nobody’s come to your place and threatened you, can you tell me why you didn’t abide by this?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): You don’t have the money?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): No, I do not have the money.\n\nJudge: Okay, you’re entitled to your money. Oddly, you wouldn’t be, but for this contract, because when you toss a thousand dollars at someone to rent a place that you know exactly what the situation is, just 'cause your mom comes later and says, “This is a really ridiculous situation,” doesn’t mean you get to not be bound by your contracts. If this weren’t here, you’d be out a thousand bucks. But this is here, and this is a new contract that supersedes the agreement to rent the place. This is one that says we are both—both recon, that you authored. So there’s no duress or anything else. You know where you say, \"You know what, I just want this over with. I don’t have your money to give it back to you now, but I’ll tell you what, if you’ll take payments, don’t sue me, you’ll take payments, and you know that’s how I’ll pay you back, but only $200 a month. That’s all I can do.\" And she agrees. Offer acceptance. New contract. That’s what this is. And then you breach this by not paying. Okay, now what are you doing now?\n\nJudge: I’m worried about you. I want to know what you’re doing now.\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): I’m currently renting a room in Queens, and I’m working.\n\nJudge: How much are you paying in rent?\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): $900.\n\nJudge: Okay, I’m splitting it with my boyfriend.\n\nJudge: And how are you doing? 'Cause I—because everybody here sounds like they’re in dire straits. You know, when you have to bring somebody to sleep on your floor, it can’t be good, is what I’m saying.\n\nDefendant (Leon Brown): To answer your question, we’re actually doing much better. We haven’t had a roommate in quite a long time, and he actually got a promotion at work a couple of months ago.\n\nJudge: Good, and um, we’re doing much better.\n\nJudge: Good, 'cause I like ending on a happier note. However, that $1,000 does have to go back to her because of your own contract.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff, $1,000.

Now, how old are you?\n\nPlaintiff: 31.\n\nJudge: All right, so you traded it in, you signed the—wow, you look so much younger.\n\nDo you have the paperwork from that trade-in?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Okay, let me see it.\n\nDid you put down any cash or just the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Just the car.\n\nJudge: Why does it say \"amount received: deposit paid by cash\"?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s what he told me to say—that he’d put an extra $1,000 down, but I didn’t.\n\nJudge (to Defendant): Why would you tell her to say that?\n\nDefendant: She didn’t give us any cash. We were just giving her a receipt that says that she paid cash.\n\nJudge: Um… it was just used to get the finance bought from the bank?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: So you tell the bank that you are trying to help her get financed by saying that she came in with cash that she didn’t come in with?\n\nWhy don’t you just tell the bank the truth—that she put down a $2,000 car?\n\nDefendant: We could have, I suppose.\n\nJudge: But why didn’t you?\n\nDefendant: We just… we didn’t write it that way.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but there’s a reason. I’m not an idiot, and neither are you—I hope.\n\nSo what is the reason?\n\nDefendant: Because they want to see some type of deposit out of the customer. She wasn’t able to give us anything.\n\nJudge: Then don’t give her something that says she did.\n\nThis is paperwork created that’s completely false to try to send to the finance company.\n\nBut why is it better to say \"$1,000 cash\" than \"$2,000 in a trade-in\"?\n\nDefendant: It’s hard when somebody comes in with bad credit and doesn’t bring any cash along with them.\n\nJudge: So saying that she brought cash when she didn’t would make it more likely for her to get financing, correct?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So we’re lying to the finance company in order for her to get financing—because it’s in your best interest to sell a car.\n\nSo we’re going to lie to the finance company.\n\nAll right, I got it.\n\nSo now she applies for financing, and what happens?\n\nDefendant: So we got a couple of options for financing, but we didn’t have very many options for vehicle selection.\n\nI gave her a couple of cars to choose from. She chose a Toyota Rav 4.\n\nWe contracted the deal with no money down, using her trade-in. She signed over the car as a trade—the ‘05 Pontiac Aztec.\n\nWe plated her, and we let her drive off the lot.\n\nJudge: Right. And so, did she have financing for the rest?\n\nDefendant: She did not.\n\nShe used a company to get financing for the rest.\n\nJudge: But you’re the one who gives her the company, right?\n\nLike, the company you use—the one you sent that other stuff to?\n\nWhat ends up happening with that?\n\nDefendant: Everything gets packaged up, sent over to the finance company. They go over the documentation we supplied them.\n\nThen, during the process of wrapping it up, they noticed that she has a permit. They contacted the dealership and asked why she was submitted with a permit.\n\nJudge: Why was she?\n\nDefendant: Well, we didn’t know she had a permit.\n\nJudge: Didn’t see her license?\n\nDefendant: We may have missed the permit situation. But we gave her the opportunity to do two things…\n\nJudge: Do you have a permit?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you have a full license?\n\nPlaintiff: I had to take the driver’s course.\n\nJudge: You’re 31 years old—you know what it’s like. Why buy a car before being able to drive alone in the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Just my dumb mistake.\n\nJudge: Okay. But what is it to you?\n\nYou’re a businessman.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nDefendant: 36.\n\nJudge: Okay. Everybody looks so young to me—I’m getting sick of it.\n\nAll right, so you’re 36. You own a business. For how long?\n\nDefendant: Seven years.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nAnd so, your answer to me for why you sold a car to someone with a permit?\n\nDefendant: We have financing for permit drivers.\n\nJudge: Well, why didn’t you do that?\n\nDefendant: This particular company would allow her some time to either get a road test completed or to have a co-signer.\n\nJudge: So why didn’t that happen?\n\nDefendant: She didn’t have a co-signer.\n\nJudge: And who is responsible for the $14,000 loan?\n\nDefendant: The co-signer.\n\nJudge: See, that’s not the same deal, is it?\n\nYou’re going to pay her the Blue Book value of the car, which is $2,000.\n\nThat is my ruling.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, deflection, framing the narrative, persuasion"}

It’s not signed also, because—watch this. Did you ever get this? It says that the deposit’s non-refundable. So, for your own protection, either have them initial it or sign it. It says on a contract, the signature is on the front.\n\nDefendant: No, I see it on both pages. I see it, I see it.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I got it. But I'm just saying, as a lawyer, I'm giving you some free advice, okay? Free advice, no charge at all. You never want a page of the contract to not have either signatures or initials. That’s why, when contracts are prepared by lawyers, there’s a space for everybody’s initials on every single page so someone doesn’t say that page—like it’s happening right here.\n\nJudge: So let’s talk, Ms. Gladden.

What did he get arrested for?\n\nPlaintiff: He had a warrant out.\n\nJudge: Why did the police get called to your home?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he jumped up in my face and was acting irrational.\n\nJudge: And what was the warrant for?\n\nPlaintiff: I'm not really sure.\n\nJudge: Domestic violence?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it wasn’t for domestic violence.\n\nJudge: All right. Well, here’s the thing though: You provided a $500 deposit, and now you want the $500 deposit back.\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t want the whole—I, even if he didn’t give me the whole $500, I just wanted something back because he didn’t provide any services.\n\nJudge: Is that his fault?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it’s not.\n\nJudge: So, January 14, you pay the $500.

How much would that cost for her date? And I told her I would have to come look at the location because if I have to get a sound system—because I’m pretty professional—I would have to come see it, take pictures, and measure the room. And at the same time, we’ll sign the agreement. I came there, took pictures of the place, we signed the agreement. She would call me like every other day.\n\nJudge: What’s “all the time”?\n\nDefendant: Every single day in a month. So she’d call me out the week maybe three or four times. I feel like, you know, I’m a child of God, so I help people—not just her, everybody. Kids, bums, it doesn’t matter, that’s just me. So, I’d pick up the phone. I won’t neglect that. When the incident happened at home, she called me from the District Attorney’s Office.\n\nJudge: She called you from the DA’s office?\n\nDefendant: Yes. And she said, “You won’t believe where I’m at.” And I talked to her, told her everything was going to be all right. If you feel like he’s going to put his hands on you, you know, don’t be with him because it hurts, it could kill you. The police drove her home in the morning, she called me, and we talked some more. Then she recorded at my studio.\n\nJudge: Recorded at your studio?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, I have a recording studio. She was doing that in between the time. After that, she called like three days later and said, “When can I pick up a deposit?”\n\nJudge: What did you say?\n\nDefendant: I said, “I can’t give you a deposit back. I could do something a little more sexier for you.”\n\nJudge: Something a little more what?\n\nDefendant: Sexy—that came out wrong. I’m sorry, that’s my slang. That means a little bit more—cooler.

She called me, and I said, “Okay, well, you know, I would love to have it.” I met with her on the 4th.\n\nJudge: When did you give her the security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: On the 4th.\n\nJudge: How much was the rent?\n\nPlaintiff: $475.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: So, I gave her the security deposit. I never signed a lease with her. I gave her the security deposit, and I asked her—\n\nJudge: When did you give her the security deposit? What day?\n\nPlaintiff: On the 4th.\n\nJudge: And then what happens? You asked her what?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked her… Well, I told her, “Hey, I’ll paint if you prorate the rent,” because, you know, she was kind of, you know, up in age, so I didn’t want to put the stress on her. I said, “I can do the work, and you just prorate the rent.”\n\nJudge: How much was she going to prorate the rent?\n\nPlaintiff: She only prorated $70.\n\nJudge: $70?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And that was the deal you guys struck? She would prorate the rent by $70?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And then what happened?\n\nJudge: She wrote— So, I filled out a receipt—\n\nJudge: Can I see what you signed? You said you filled out a receipt. What are you talking about?\n\nPlaintiff: (Hands over receipt)\n\nJudge: Who’s the person next to you who keeps raising their hand?\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: (Raises hand)\n\nJudge: Keep your hand down. I’ll get to you in a minute if you have something to do with the case. He’s 26.\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: (Lowers hand)\n\nJudge: I know, I know the urge, believe me. I clean up after my 22 and 21-year-old all day long.\n\nJudge: (Examines documents) Okay, so she gave you a receipt to acknowledge your security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And so what else?\n\nPlaintiff: So, um, I asked her—after I got done painting—she brought the lease over for me to sign. I said, “Well, hey, before I sign it, can we, you know, do a walk-through?”\n\nJudge: And?\n\nPlaintiff: She’s like, “No, sign the lease and then we’ll walk through the place.”\n\nJudge: So, what do you say?\n\nPlaintiff: I said, “I wasn’t going to do it. I’m not going to sign a lease until you come upstairs and look at what I’ve painted.”\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: She was just so adamant about me signing this lease before she comes up. So, I didn’t do it. The registers on the floor where the heat comes through—there were none there. You could literally fall through.\n\nJudge: Did you note all these things before you handed over money and agreed that you were going to rent it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, under the understanding that she would, you know, at least meet me halfway to take care of it.\n\nJudge: Right. But when you say “under the understanding,” there’s the understanding in between your ears and there’s the understanding between two people. Why is there not a written agreement?     Judge: Okay, so at this point, you’re saying, “I’m not going to sign the lease until we do a walk-through.” What does she do?\n\nPlaintiff: She says, “No, I’m not doing a walk-through. Sign the lease first.”\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: I told her, “I’m not signing the lease unless you do a walk-through,” so she got mad and said, “You can’t have the apartment anymore.”\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you ask for your security deposit back?\n\nPlaintiff: I did.\n\nJudge: And what did she say?\n\nPlaintiff: She said, “I’m not giving it back to you because you wasted my time.”\n\nJudge: All right. Let’s hear from you, Ms. Hoffman.\n\nDefendant’s Response\nDefendant: Your Honor, I had told him when he came to look at the apartment that the apartment was not yet ready, that there were a few repairs that had to be made. I was having the registers replaced and some minor things taken care of.\n\nJudge: Did you tell him that before or after he gave you the security deposit?\n\nDefendant: Before. I told him that when he looked at the place. He seemed fine with it and was very eager to move in.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happened when he refused to sign the lease?\n\nDefendant: He kept insisting that we do a walk-through before signing. I explained to him that I always have tenants sign the lease first and then we do a formal walk-through together. That’s just how I’ve always done it.\n\nJudge: Why not just do a quick walk-through first if that’s what he wanted?\n\nDefendant: Because in my experience, tenants use that as an excuse to delay signing or to demand more repairs. I told him the issues were already scheduled to be fixed, but he didn’t believe me.\n\nJudge: So, when he refused to sign, what did you do?\n\nDefendant: I told him that if he wasn’t comfortable signing, then I would have to rent it to someone else.\n\nJudge: And when he asked for his security deposit back?\n\nDefendant: I told him no, because I had taken the apartment off the market for him and turned down other potential renters. That cost me time and money.\n\nJudge’s Ruling\nJudge: All right. Here’s where I’m at. Ms. Hoffman, I understand that it is frustrating when a tenant backs out after agreeing to rent, but a security deposit is meant to secure a rental agreement. If there is no signed lease, there is no binding rental agreement.\n\nDefendant: But I held the apartment for him!\n\nJudge: That was your choice. If you wanted a firm commitment, you should have had him sign the lease before giving you any money. The fact that he painted the apartment before even signing a lease is unusual, but that was an agreement you both made, and you only agreed to prorate $70, which he accepted.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Since there was no signed lease, you had no legal grounds to keep his deposit. You can’t hold onto money for an agreement that never existed in writing. You need to return his $475.\n\nDefendant: But he wasted my time!\n\nJudge: Unfortunately, that’s a risk landlords take when they don’t have tenants sign leases upfront. I am ordering you to return the plaintiff’s full security deposit of $475.\n\nPlaintiff: And the money for painting?\n\nJudge: No, because you agreed to do the painting in exchange for a $70 rent reduction. That was the deal, and it stands. You’re getting back your security deposit, but nothing more.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: Judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $475.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting , deflection, playing the victim"}
{"id": "326", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case in the docket. Imagine the Plaintiff is surrounded by cops with guns drawn after the Defendant says the Plaintiff stole his car. She says she bought it. The Defendant says he loaned the Plaintiff the car, and she just disappeared. It’s the case of \"Son of a Gun.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Ms. Roth Rock, how do you and Mr. Mill know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, we were friends for about 14 years.\n\nJudge: You had been renting cars because your car was totaled, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And at some point, he offered to you, \"Why don’t you just drive or buy this car?\"\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What was the purchase price?\n\nPlaintiff: It was $2,500.\n\nJudge: Did you pay that?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, the car needed repairs, so we decided that I would do the repairs and then we would subtract the amount from the $2,500.\n\nJudge: And in the meantime, you get to drive it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What were you paying while you were using the car?\n\nPlaintiff: I wasn’t paying anything.\n\nJudge: So you had a free car to use?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, no, because I had actually put about $1,900 in repairs. And then we decided I was going to pay him when we transferred the title.\n\nJudge: What was the delay in transferring the title?\n\nPlaintiff: He was doing repairs at his house, so he wasn’t able to find the title. Then he said he had to go to the state, and time just went by.\n\nJudge: When we say \"time just went by,\" we’re not talking about ten days, we’re talking about ten months, right? That apparently nobody can figure out how to solve the problem.\n\nPlaintiff: I wasn’t able to drive it for all that time because the car actually sat for about two months. It wound up needing an alternator and wheel bearings. So I got a different car.\n\nJudge: And then what happened at the end of those two months?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I finished the repairs on the car and then I contacted Bob. We were supposed to meet, and he didn’t show up.\n\nJudge: You were supposed to meet and do what?\n\nPlaintiff: Transfer the title, and I would pay him the balance.\n\nJudge: Did he agree with you that that would be fine?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mr. Mill, let me hear your side of what's going on with this car.\n\nDefendant: As she stated, I did lend her the car in November 2015, but it should have been only for a few months, like the holidays, because I thought she was buying another car. And then her number just disappeared.\n\nJudge: What does that mean?\n\nDefendant: Well, I had a number for her memorized, and that number just got deleted. I had no way to contact her.\n\nJudge: When you say deleted—deleted from your brain or deleted from your phone?\n\nDefendant: From my phone.\n\nJudge: What year car is this?\n\nDefendant: A ‘98.\n\nJudge: How well did you know her that you just gave her your car?\n\nDefendant: Like she stated, I had known her for 14 years.\n\nJudge: So how do you have her number disappear? If I know somebody so well that I give them a car, I know how to get the car back. I know how to get a hold of them.\n\nDefendant: I had known her all this time. I had been renting cars...\n\nJudge: Were you in a romantic relationship?\n\nDefendant: No, not at all.\n\nJudge: Then why were you renting cars for her?\n\nDefendant: I was doing it as a favor.\n\nJudge: Does it make sense that the Defendant, knowing the Plaintiff for 14 years, had no idea how to get in touch with her?\n\nDefendant: I guess I didn’t.\n\nJudge: So when did you first decide to report the car stolen?\n\nDefendant: I waited a few months. I called the Melbourne Police Department, but they wouldn’t report it stolen because I handed her the keys. Then about four months later, I called again and said I needed to report the car stolen.\n\nJudge: Ms. Roth Rock, how did you first find out that law enforcement was involved?\n\nPlaintiff: I was driving, had just picked up my son, and pulled into a McDonald’s. Then I saw police cars behind me, and they had their guns drawn. They told me the car was reported stolen, and they arrested me.\n\nJudge: So you got charged with Grand Theft?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what happened with that case?\n\nPlaintiff: It was dismissed.\n\nJudge: What are you suing for?\n\nPlaintiff: My belongings that were in the car, worth $4,875.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of these belongings?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a list: passports, birth certificates, an Apple iPad, two cameras, and a platinum and sapphire ring.\n\nJudge: According to the police inventory, none of those valuable items were listed. They only listed miscellaneous clothing, toiletries, and books.\n\nPlaintiff: They did a visual inspection; they didn’t take items out.\n\nJudge: Or maybe you didn’t have those things, and you're trying to collect money?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s incorrect.\n\nJudge: Mr. Mill, did you find any of these items?\n\nDefendant: No, ma'am. I have a letter from my daughter saying none of those things were in the car.\n\nJudge: Ms. Roth Rock, I find that you have woefully failed to prove that you had these items in the car. I find in favor of the Defendant.\n\nJudge: Case dismissed.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Emotional Appeal,Evasion "}
{"id": "1026", "dialogue": "Judge:\nDouglas, Allison Raa, you are suing your former hairdresser, Vincent Maresi, for $5,000, the cost of hair extensions, color treatment, a new haircut, and pain and suffering, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, because according to you, he not only ruined your hair but deliberately ruined it.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you have a counterclaim against her for $5,000 for saying such a thing?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let's hear it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, I've been going to Vinnie for, I want to say, two or three years, um, faithfully, and I was trying to get a hold of him at a certain point to do my hair, and I couldn’t, so I went somewhere else to get my hair done. And then the color didn’t match, it wasn’t damaged, it was just color that needed to be done. So I went and I scheduled an appointment with Vinnie to correct it. And he decided to do an ombre on my hair, which an ombre is, um, something that basically looks like it’s dark all on the top and then lightens up at the bottom, and um, he started to do the ombre, left the decolorizer on my hair.\n\nDefendant:\nWhat’s a decolorizer?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt’s like bleach, you know, to lighten like if you’re to get a highlight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd, um, left it on there for about two hours. By the time I got to the sink, it was just completely—just coming, coming out.\n\nJudge:\nYour hair was falling out right there?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, my hair was coming out at the sink, and, um, then they rinsed me, and they asked me, did I want a blowout, and I said, and I know he could specifically remember, I said no, I held my hand up, was a no blowout for me because I knew once the heat went on my hair, it was going to just melt off. So I paid and ran out of there, and I went home and washed it out, dried it, and it was just breaking, coming off all over my floor.\n\nJudge:\nA picture of it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh yeah, I have pictures of everything.\nLet me see all the pictures here. The pictures. Okay, in what order is this?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI wrote on the bottom, this is prior to going to the salon. That was right before, but if you look at the other pictures, you’ll see like day... you’ll see it after, blow-drying the first time, second blow-dry.\n\nJudge:\nWhy is your hair so dark here, and it was so light here?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat's what he put on my hair was the blonde. That was what was breaking. So what happened was I ended up having to go and pay a fortune to get it completely corrected and get extensions, and get treatments, and get all my hair cut off, and I had to pay all this money to do this when he, I feel like he intentionally did it. Because on Facebook, I was having a conversation with one of my friends, and she asked me how my hair came out, and I said that, well, being that half of it is on my bathroom floor right now, I would say not so good.\n\nDefendant:\nThen you pipe in and say, \"Hey, you stray, you pay. At least we got all the crap hair off. I saved you a haircut.\"\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhy would you say that?\n\nDefendant:\nCan I just, um, backtrack? Yeah. Can I just tell you a little bit about myself? A second-generation hairdresser for 20 years. I’ve been an educator for a major company for the first 10 years of my career. Um, I take my job very seriously, and I was looking through my phone and she made these comments at the end of the night, and it took me by surprise, and it got me, uh, mad, because I felt that’s why she’s saying, “Oh my God, he did this on purpose because I went to someone else.” So I said those two comments to her, “You stray, you pay.” I mean, that’s a pretty insensitive thing for you to say to a customer who’s been your customer for years when she’s upset because her hair’s falling out.\n\nDefendant:\nI inboxed her right after that and apologized, and I said, \"Let me see how you inbox her right after that and apologize. I need to come ASAP.\"\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, this is before the appointment. I started filming next season. What do you film on?\n\nDefendant:\nI was, at the time, filming for Jersey Licious.\n\nPlaintiff:\nDo you have a role in Jersey Licious?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, a short role.\n\nPlaintiff:\nA role, nonetheless.\n\nDefendant:\nOkay, you say, \"Hey, you stray, you pay. At least we got all the crap hair off. I saved you a haircut.\" And she responds, “You saved me a haircut? Really?”\n\nDefendant:\nSo you intentionally did this?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd you answer, \"Really?\"\n\nDefendant:\nThat’s why I inboxed her right after that. And then you inbox her, “Would I do that to you?”\n\nPlaintiff:\nI know, no one knows who you are talking about, but it bothers me when you bash me like that. I’m sorry that happened. Would I do that to your hair on purpose? No. That was the only way for that black hair to... you will have to stay dark, then have it straight up. That was the only way I couldn’t get the black hair lighter. If we couldn’t do it that way, then she’ll have to stay darker if she can’t be blonde.\n\nDefendant:\nOh, then you would have had to stay dark.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYou know, this is the second time I corrected her hair from going to someone. I always say you stray, you pay when you go to another hairdresser. You pay for the integrity of your hair sometimes when you don’t know what they’re doing to it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah, but the one who did something to it was you in this one, right?\n\nDefendant:\nIf her hair fell out—have you seen the pictures?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, no. I asked her to come to, I—you know, she never came to the salon to show me, and my owner texted me and asked me if we can meet and talk, and I said, \"Meet and talk about what?\" You reimbursing me for all the money that I’ve spent having to correct my hair. And then he never responded.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, I have those texts if you want to see them.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, I’d like to see them. And then can you take a look at the pictures?\n\nDefendant:\nNever saw any of these.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I know, but now you’re seeing them. So what do you have to say about them?\n\nDefendant:\nI can’t say that’s my work because she never came back to the salon to show me. Nobody ever asked me to come.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I understand that she never came back to the salon. However, we have pictures of the hair falling out. Right? That’s what those are. It’s not like she decided to pin it on you, but it was somebody else who broke the hair. It was after your visit. So now what?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, she is a hairdresser, so I do not know what she did at home to damage her hair. And when she says \"intentionally,\" she’s almost accusing me of saying when she was in my chair, I intentionally damaged it.\n\nJudge:\nWell, the reason why she thinks that you intentionally damaged it is because you are a jerk on the Facebook page. She never used the word \"intentional\" till you emailed her your nasty comment. Then she said, “What are you talking about? Was this intentional?” That’s when she uses it. Because it sounded like maybe it was when you talked that way. Do you understand?\n\nDefendant:\nTotally.\n\nJudge:\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Harvey Levin here. So the question is, \"What does 'You stray, you pay' mean?\" Does that mean that he tried to screw her up for going to somebody else? Or does it mean you go to somebody else, and they’re going to do a bad job?\n\nDefendant:\nYou go to somebody else, and they’re going to do a bad job. You go to somebody else, you pay for it.\n\nJudge:\nI mean, that’s what you get. You should stick with the regulars.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, but so you think you're saying what he said was innocent?\n\nJudge:\nYou think it was innocent?\n\nDefendant:\nUh, I don’t think it was innocent.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYou think \"you stray, you pay\" means, \"I’m going to screw you up\"?\n\nDefendant:\nExactly. You knew it.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re going to be the tiebreaker.\n\nDefendant:\nHey, I think you—you—you screwed up. You’re going to pay me because you went to the wrong guy. You should have stayed with me.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s what I think.\n\nDefendant:\nYou think you screwed her up?\n\nJudge:\nUm, I don’t think he screwed her up. I think he, uh, made her—she should make her pay.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, going inside the courtroom.\n\nDefendant:\nHe did respond: \"I’m truly sorry that happened. I really am. I wish you would have come to the salon the day after so me and Carol could have talked to you. I know you a long time. You said on Facebook you intentionally did it, Vin.\"\n\nJudge:\nSee, that’s the problem. You know, there’s a lot of business is just human emotion. You know, if somebody talked to you like that and said if a doctor said something like that to you, would you go back to visit that doctor?\n\nDefendant:\nYou would never go back to—you’d have like a total bad vibe about it. I’m only human and sometimes I understand. Sometimes it takes that responsibility by, but I guarantee all my work and my shop backs up my clients and backs me up. You said on Facebook you intentionally did it, Vin.\n\nPlaintiff:\nShe says, \"Let me know if you want to reimburse me for what I paid at the salon and what I’ve paid to fix it. If not, I’ll just see you 11:21.\"\n\nJudge:\nWill let the judge decide. This is ridiculous. A friend wouldn’t do what you did, Vinnie. You have no clue how bad my hair is now. I had to get it all cut off and get 250 strands of mic crochet at $10 a blanking strand, plus dying it, plus treatments. I trusted you. This is so blank, Vin.\n\nDefendant:\nLet me see the receipts from the next place.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAll the receipts for what you're suing for.\n[Plaintiff presents receipts and bank statements.]\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I think everything else is actually in those pictures too. She needs to see that you didn’t want to just go short.\n\nDefendant:\nNo, why not?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I don’t look good with short hair at all.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s the pain and suffering?\n\nPlaintiff:\nPain and suffering to me is like, imagine you at a salon as a woman, and then...\n\nJudge:\nHold on, I’m going to imagine myself as a woman. Hold on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh my God, you know what I mean?\n\nJudge:\nI do know what you mean. I think that that kind of silly talk is the reason why then it sounds disingenuous when we stand up and demand equal pay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, bad hair.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, bad hair day. Everybody gets it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, Butch up.\n\nJudge:\nJeez.\n\nPlaintiff:\nCan I say something?\n\nJudge:\nNo, you cannot, and if I were you, I wouldn’t.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, because I’m about to rule and you’re about to get a lot of this back.\n\nDefendant:\nLet us talk, let her talk.\n\nPlaintiff:\nStop!\n\nJudge:\nSo don’t make me angry. Okay, so I’m not ordering the almost $2,000 in pain and suffering. I’m not ordering the money back that you paid the defendant. I am going to order the defendant to pay that which you had to pay in order to get the benefit of your bargain, which was the good job. And I’m ordering him to pay you $2,855.\n\nJudge:\nAnd let me give you a piece of advice. When my 14-year-old reflexively writes something on Facebook, I take her computer away. Okay? Somebody in your life needs to take your computer away. So you have to choose: Are you going to be a 14-year-old or are you going to be a businessman? Good luck. Oh, on your counterclaim for $5,000, in case it wasn’t obvious...\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting, Minimization, Dismissal"}
{"id": "776", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff helps people get car insurance, and the defendant stiffed him. But the defendant says the guy’s a rip-off artist. It’s the case of “You’re in bad hands.”\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, David Z. Vandervell, doing business as Ure One Investments and Insurance, you are suing... You want to be referred to as Malcolm?\n\nDefendant: Yes, please.\n\nJudge: You are suing the defendant for $3,533.61 in insurance fees that you say he owes you. What happened here?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, Mr. Malcolm came with his cousin in 2015. They needed car insurance. The cousin wasn’t working, and they couldn’t get insurance elsewhere. I specialize in assigned risk insurance.\n\nJudge: So you specialize in selling insurance to people who would have a hard time getting affordable insurance?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. Not those who can't get insurance, but those who can't get affordable insurance.\n\nJudge: Why were you having trouble getting conventional insurance?\n\nDefendant: Tickets.\n\nJudge: What was it?\n\nDefendant: Well, it was just that I hadn’t had a car insured in some time, and I did have a previous suspension for unpaid tickets.\n\nJudge: Okay. So just tell me what happened in this case. You sold him insurance on what date?\n\nPlaintiff: September 5, 2015.\n\nJudge: And you sold him insurance for a year. The insurance was going to cost how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $2,770 plus $50, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So then how much are you charging in finance?\n\nPlaintiff: What we do is take a risk. Until the ninth month that they pay consecutively, if they cancel or drop out, we lose money because we pay for months 10, 11, and 12 upfront.\n\nJudge: So until the 10th month, not the 9th month?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So his monthly payments were supposed to be what?\n\nPlaintiff: The first year, it came down to $236.\n\nJudge: So then, like, the last two payments of $236 would be the interest charges for financing. All right. So now, in that first year, they find out there’s a teenager in the house, and they raise his insurance. How much?\n\nPlaintiff: $458.\n\nJudge: Okay. From the inception of the insurance?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I asked him many times for a letter from the dean or whoever is in charge to prove that the young lady is studying at least 22 hours a week.\n\nJudge: And then what did you do? Did you ever tell your daughter she had to get proof she was living in Albany?\n\nDefendant: I guess because it was during her first year, she was getting situated in school. The process got drawn out, and I never actually followed through to get the information he requested.\n\nJudge: So now, the year ends. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: At the end of the year, they owed me $766.43 from payments they had not made.\n\nJudge: But how do you get to this $3,533?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s very simple, Your Honor. I kept calling Mr. Malcolm and his cousin. I said, “Guys, we have a new policy coming in on September 5. You have to pay the back amount plus the future amount.”\n\nJudge: What happened on September 5?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t go in. My cousin went in to make the payment.\n\nJudge: And what was the payment for?\n\nDefendant: To keep the policy from being canceled.\n\nJudge: So year two kicks in, but you guys still owe him money. What’s your defense?\n\nDefendant: My defense is that even though we dealt with David as the broker, I would still receive statements from the insurance company. From what I received, the amount I owed was different from what he said.\n\nJudge: That’s because you have to pay finance charges. Show me the difference.\n\nDefendant: This is the last statement I received from the insurance company. At the time of cancellation, it shows a balance.\n\nJudge: Did the insurance get canceled?\n\nDefendant: I let it lapse.\n\nJudge: How come?\n\nDefendant: Because I knew that after having insurance for a year with no major violations, I could get something more affordable.\n\nJudge: So you’re suspicious because this notice says the premium due is $1,699, but you were paying $2,770 for the year, which would be an additional $1,071 in finance charges. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: I prepaid two months. The difference was $60.99 because I had already prepaid part of his insurance.\n\nJudge: According to your invoice, you’re out $1,463.61. That’s the insurance he hasn’t paid for. Why are you now asking for $3,533?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, the insurance company still wants more money.\n\nJudge: But you haven't proven that.

{"id": "411", "dialogue": "JUDGE:\nOkay, Plaintiff, you are suing Defendant, your cousin, doing business as a daycare center. You’re suing for $5,000 in pain and suffering, taxes, and $750 that you say you weren’t paid in your last paycheck. What’s going on?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI worked for her. She hired me November 17, 2008, and I worked for her until April 17, 2010. My last check, she did not give me, but she paid everybody else. Then I filed taxes—\n\nJUDGE:\nHold on one second. Your last check was for what?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nThe month of March and April.\n\nJUDGE:\nFor March toward April?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYeah, because you get paid every third Friday.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd you were getting paid $750 a month?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nAll right. When she fired you, did she tell you why she was firing you?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo, and she never fired me. I left off the premises because she didn’t pay me.\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay, did you give her a chance to pay you before you left?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo, because she said she wasn’t paying anybody. I called her—\n\nJUDGE:\nTell me what happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nShe said, “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.”\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay. Had you already been having problems with her paying late or anything like that?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo, I didn’t have any problems with her at all before that.\n\nJUDGE:\nWere you socializing as cousins, or was she strictly your employer?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nWe were talking, we were all that. There weren’t any problems. I didn’t have any problems with her.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd at this daycare, her mother was working there too?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nThat’s your great-aunt?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYep.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd you were getting along fine with her?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYeah, we argued a couple of times, but it wasn’t—like, it wasn’t part of the daycare.\n\nJUDGE:\nAll right. So when she tells you, “Don’t call me, I’ll call you,” your paycheck is how late at that point?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nIt was only a day late.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo it’s odd that you would quit over something like that when you’ve been working there for all those years and the payment was only a day late. What made you decide to walk off?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nBecause of gratitude, basically. And she told other employees to come to her house that Friday to get their money, and they got paid that day.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo when was it you decided to quit?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nWhen I found out that others did get paid.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo you quit the same day because she told you she wasn’t going to pay you?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd did she tell you why she felt she didn’t have to pay?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo, she just told me to leave her alone.\n\nJUDGE:\nShe says you didn’t pay.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nJudge, I did pay her. What she’s talking about, when she walked off the premises, that’s not what happened. I came into the job, I don’t know what had happened before I got there, but she was swearing at me, cussing at me. I said, “You’re not going to talk to me that way, and I need you to leave the premises.”\n\nJUDGE:\nShe says it was because you had a dispute over payment. So you do know what happened before you got there.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nNo, we didn’t have a dispute over payment because that was a payment day, and I was coming to do payroll that day.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo what is the reason, then, that she’s mad?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI have no idea.\n\nJUDGE:\nThat seems untruthful. People know why their employees of two years, who happen to be their cousin, are so mad. Something happened, and you know what it is.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nOkay, I’ll tell you what happened. Before they even got to the payment issue, there were problems at the daycare with my mom and her. She cussed my mom out.\n\nJUDGE:\nNow we’re getting somewhere. Go ahead.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nMy mom allowed them to go into her house to get different items. Her medication went missing. Money went missing. My mom is diabetic—she needed her medication, and it wasn’t there. When I began to question everyone, nobody knew what happened. Plaintiff cussed my mom out, and when I walked in, she was just going off.\n\nJUDGE:\nWhat day was this?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nApril 17th, Friday—the day I was supposed to pay my employees.\n\nJUDGE:\nShe says you never paid her. Prove you paid her.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI paid her in cash. She was on DSS, and they couldn’t know she was working, so I paid her under the table.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo prove it.

{"id": "761", "dialogue": "\"Judge: All parties, please raise your hands.\nJudge: We see it come to order.\nJudge: Please raise your right hand.\nJudge: You are under oath.\nJudge: Susan J Gordon, yes you are suing Mary Rose Angle and Todd Angle. Mr. Angle, you'll be representing both yourself and—uh, is that your wife?\nTodd Angle: It is.\nJudge: Okay, and you have power of attorney to do so. You are suing them for copyright infringement to the tune of $5,000, which is the statutory maximum in New York. You say your damage is actually more than that because they used seven of the stories that you have previously published in a book, and they added those seven stories 29 times on their website. Okay, let's talk.\nJudge: You wrote a book called Wedding Days: When and How Great Marriages Began, and tell us what the book's about.\nSusan J. Gordon: It's a collection of hundreds of stories about the courtships and marriages of famous couples throughout history. Famous couples such as John and Jacqueline Kennedy, Napoleon and Josephine, Lucy and Desi, Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King. It took me over three years to write this book.\nJudge: When did you write the book?\nSusan J. Gordon: The book was published in 1998.\nJudge: 1998, and it took you three years up to that point, full three years of research and writing to collect these stories.\nJudge: How many stories are in here?\nSusan J. Gordon: One for every day of the year, and I added Adam and Eve on February 29th because I just had fun imagining what their wedding day would be like.\nJudge: I've read the excerpts of the book that are on your website, and this is so right up my alley, I can't tell you. You know, these short stories are... I hate to say bathroom reading, but you don't have to commit a long time. I know it sounds awful, but you know, you can have it on a cocktail table. Somebody can look at it for just a little bit. You don’t have to commit.\nJudge: Each one is so enticing because I am so gossipy, and I love hearing these little details. And you've got a picture of the couples. I mean, this is really very enjoyable.\nJudge: Now, you did publish it a long time ago. I imagine that as most books, you know, the sales start to—unless you're the Bible—the sales start to eventually wither, right? That's normal for a book.\nSusan J. Gordon: Very normal, especially after we're talking about 10, 15 years now.\nJudge: So right now, if I wanted to buy the book, what's the average price of the book online?\nSusan J. Gordon: The book varies online. It is sold by used book dealers at this point. You can pay $5, you can pay $170, or you might be able to pay 90 cents or a dollar.\nJudge: I know because I went online.\nJudge: Okay. But so now you published this book about 15 years ago or so, and then you, um, you periodically go online checking to see if someone's using the book?\nSusan J. Gordon: No, I go online, uh, as yourself. Stories popped up in many different places. Their website had 29 times.\nJudge: So sometimes 25, 26?\nSusan J. Gordon: When you say 29 times, you're not saying because you kept pressing the same page. You're saying in 29 sites?\nSusan J. Gordon: Yes, because now when you find out that they've used your work, by the way, are they citing to you? Are they quoting you as the author, or are they just using your work without permission, which is not following copyright law?\nSusan J. Gordon: No, they are not citing me.\nJudge: Okay. So when you find out that they are not citing your work, they are giving you credit, but they never asked your permission, what did you do?\nSusan J. Gordon: I was stunned. I spoke to my husband, who was a lawyer, although he's not an intellectual property lawyer.\nJudge: What kind of lawyer is he?\nSusan J. Gordon: He is a real estate lawyer, so it's nothing to do with it, but he's smart. He also helped me with the research, and he loved it too.\nSusan J. Gordon: So we contacted them several weeks later, I would say early June or late May, I think in June, and asked that they please remove the stories forthwith. Did they?\nTodd Angle: Not entirely. Some lingered into June. I don’t know why. This all started around May 20th, 22nd.\nJudge: When were you contacted by her to cease and desist?\nTodd Angle: I think it was around June.\nJudge: And what did you do?\nTodd Angle: We were kind of shocked in the beginning. We were pretty naive about copyright laws, to be honest. We immediately called Mr. Gordon, apologized, and I told him we would take it down right away.\nTodd Angle: They’re correct. We mistakenly missed one of them.\nJudge: So they asked us to save the files. We did, on the server.\nJudge: And that was about what we did. We just pulled it all down.\nJudge: What is this site? Tell me what this is.\nTodd Angle: My wife started a blog in the beginning of the year 2011. The intent of the blog was to educate people on different wedding issues, you know, gay marriages. Also, she's an Interfaith minister, so a lot of interfaith topics and things like that. It was more for her to inform the public about weddings and also get used to doing a blog. We were kind of new to this technology.\nJudge: What kind of traffic did your blog have?\nTodd Angle: It doesn’t have much traffic at all.\nJudge: Say you show me some proof of what kind of traffic your blog has.\nTodd Angle: Well, I have the chart for those seven postings— a chart of all the people that did click-throughs through that.\nJudge: So during the whole time, how long did you have her articles up?\nTodd Angle: I believe it was at maximum 60 days.\nJudge: For those 60 days, you notice it in May?\nTodd Angle: Yes.\nJudge: So for those 60 days, that's what you're going to show me. How many people clicked?\nTodd Angle: 154 times.\nJudge: Okay. Why were you thinking this was going to be okay? Just in general, that you could take somebody's work?\nTodd Angle: At the time, she thought that, uh... Did you know she was doing this?\nSusan J. Gordon: No.\nJudge: What’s your profession?\nTodd Angle: I'm a project manager.\nJudge: Why isn’t she here?\nTodd Angle: She’s out of the country. She's working for a nonprofit.\nJudge: So did you know she was doing this?\nTodd Angle: No, I didn’t.\nJudge: You found out when you were found out.\nTodd Angle: Yes.\nJudge: Let’s talk about this. There is a concept, which I'm sure you are both extremely familiar with, and the law calls the fair use doctrine.\nJudge: The rule is you can’t use other people's stuff without paying them. That’s the rule. That's why they copyright their work. You’re not allowed to use someone else’s intellectual property.\nJudge: The exception is if you've used it in a way that the law looks at as fair use. There are four factors that the courts look at in order to determine if what the purported infringer did was a copyright violation or fair use.\nJudge: Let’s go over them:\nJudge: One, the purpose of the use.\nJudge: Was it used in a non-commercial or commercial setting?\nJudge: You said it was on their website. What is your website?\nTodd Angle: Does she charge for membership? No.\nJudge: Does she advertise on it? No.\nJudge: What is the purpose of her doing it?\nTodd Angle: To inform the public about weddings. She's an officiant for weddings.\nJudge: Does she list her name and phone number so you can reach her to perform your wedding?\nTodd Angle: Let me check.\nJudge: Is that you? You're right on there. How do you not know what's on the blog?\nTodd Angle: No, I know it's on there.\nJudge: That does not militate toward fair use. What’s the next one?\nJudge: The nature of the copyrighted work.\nJudge: Is this book nonfiction or fiction?\nSusan J. Gordon: Nonfiction, other than the few times I imagined what Adam and Eve's wedding day would be like.\nJudge: The nature of work as nonfiction militates more towards less protection for you because it’s not your art. The stories belong to the couples, not you. That militates toward fair use.\nJudge: The second part of that is: Is it published or unpublished?\nJudge: This is a published work, which militates toward the defendant.\nJudge: The amount of the work used.\nJudge: You have 365 stories in here. There were seven stories used. That's a small percentage.\nJudge: That militates toward finding this to be fair use.\nJudge: The effect on the potential market or value of the work.\nJudge: Does his use cut into your income?\nSusan J. Gordon: This hinders it. I need to control all access to these stories.\nJudge: I think if they had contacted you and said, \"\"We'll offer you a couple thousand, and we want to give you some advertising,\"\" why would you ever say no to that? It could only help you.\nJudge: But they did it behind your back. I understand the frustration.\nJudge: Since the law is \"\"you use it, you pay,\"\" I have to consider how and why you used it.\nJudge: I find this to be fair use.\nJudge: That’s my verdict.\n\n\nJudge: How has this cut into your profit margin?\nTodd Angle: We want to control the publicity, but we didn't mean to hurt Mrs. Gordon. We're sorry she feels this way.\nJudge: The fair use doctrine is complicated, and if you end up using someone else’s stuff, make sure to check with a lawyer first. It's a technical area of the law.\nJudge: That will do it for this case. Next case coming up.\n\n\nSusan J. Gordon: I had hoped this would send a message to people who lift authors’ work and post them online without permission.\nSusan J. Gordon: There were two issues here, but do you think you got your point across?\nSusan J. Gordon: No, I don’t, because fair use is when you take a sentence or two, not between two and 3,000 words, which is what was extracted from my book.\nSusan J. Gordon: I'm very disappointed.\nJudge: You got a lot of exposure by bringing it into this courtroom.\nTodd Angle: I've learned that copyright is very important. You have to respect these laws and educate yourself when posting things on the internet.\nJudge: You were very close to losing this case. We feel bad for Mrs. Gordon, but it was fair use. Copyright is complicated. You better check with a lawyer if you're using other people's stuff for a blog or website.\"", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, persuasion"}

{"id": "149", "dialogue": "Judge: Valencia Ray, you are suing Cyber Electronics Incorporated, represented here by its owner, Joseph Rivas, for $435, a refund on an LG 4K television, 43-inch. What a great price. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I had went to the store to buy a TV. I usually get my electronics fixed there. I asked them if I could purchase a TV because I was going to a doctor’s appointment and I could come back and pick it up. He said no problem. I came back to pick up the TV. Meanwhile, the guy from the store took the TV out the store, brought it up the hill, and put it in the cab.\n\nJudge: Okay. That was nice. Did you see him drop it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: All I saw was that he said he put it in the cab already, in the trunk.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t watch him bring the TV?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I just saw him.\n\nJudge: Did you say, “Wait a second, I need to inspect the TV?”\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not. I did not say that.\n\nJudge: So then what happens? You go—\n\nPlaintiff: Then I get home. My building has security. The cab driver took it out, and I asked security if he could place it in front of the building. My neighbor was coming down. He said, “I’ll help you with the TV.” They took the TV. We put it in the elevator. They took it upstairs.\n\nJudge: Were you in the elevator with them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. We get into my apartment. My girlfriend is there because she comes over. I said, “Let’s take the TV and put it together.” When we took it out of the box, I noticed a crack. She said, “No, that’s probably the plastic.” Then when I took off the Styrofoam, I saw it was a big break. Not even an hour later, I called them back and I explained it to them. There’s no damage to the box. There’s no damage to the Styrofoam. But the TV’s broken.\n\nJudge: Let me hear from you. What’s your protocol over there?\n\nDefendant: On May 16, 2017, we received TVs from the manufacturer. One employee visually inspected all of them, the outside boxes, and then proceeded to test all the TVs for damages.\n\nJudge: When the TVs are shipped to you?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: What employee did that? Is Abdullah here?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So do you actually remember these particular TVs, or is this what you do whenever a shipment comes in?\n\nEmployee: That’s what I do anytime we receive a TV in the store.\n\nJudge: Do you record your findings in any way? Like, is there somewhere where you’re supposed to write stuff down, or do you only— Hold on, am I talking to you?\n\nDefendant: Sorry.\n\nJudge: Is there somewhere where you’re supposed to write stuff down, or do you just say something if it’s broken?\n\nEmployee: We have a paper that we sign.\n\nJudge: Go ahead. Now you can show them the paper.\n\nDefendant: Show it to your employee, please.\n\nJudge: Is that paper— Is that your writing on the paper?\n\nEmployee: Yes.\n\nJudge: And is that your signature?\n\nEmployee: Yes.\n\nJudge: Was that paper authored on the same day that you inspected it?\n\nEmployee: Yes.\n\nJudge: Which was the day that it came in from the manufacturer?\n\nEmployee: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what do you guys do with it?\n\nEmployee: We check all of them. Once we don’t see any broken TVs, we place them to sell.\n\nJudge: Do you put them back in the box, or do you put them on a shelf?\n\nEmployee: We put them back in the box and sell them.\n\nJudge: So when somebody buys a TV, what do you guys do? If they don’t ask to inspect it—tough for them, I guess?\n\nEmployee: We check the TV twice as a normal procedure. On this particular situation, the TV was only checked once.\n\nJudge: I just— I’m not sure that it falls on you. I think it’s good that you do that, but I’m just not sure that it falls on them to inspect. Like, in other words, when I valet my car, I literally stand at the top right corner of the car when they come, and then I walk around. I don’t want to be obvious about the fact that I’m inspecting the car, but I know that if I drive off, the valet is going to say, “How do we know what you did with it?”\n\nJudge: Can the TV be damaged without the box being damaged?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because if someone dropped the TV, the box would still be fine.\n\nJudge: Well, here’s a TV that’s heavy and lots of people touched it. Maybe you bought it broken, maybe you didn’t. But the problem is, I don’t deal in maybes. You have to be able to prove that they broke it and not that you took off and then your security guy and your friend or you trying to bring it up broke it. How are you going to do that?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a letter from the LG technician who came to the house. He looked at it and inspected the box and the Styrofoam and everything. He said this was a shipping and handling defect.\n\nJudge: Oh, good, then they’ll replace it for you.\n\nPlaintiff: No, they told him—\n\nJudge: I can’t say they broke it.

I didn’t know what was going on. I just wanted to leave. And it was a very cold night, but I just wanted to leave.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So she said to me, \"As long as you have your ticket, your coat will remain here.\"\n\nJudge: Did you have your ticket?\n\nPlaintiff: I still have my ticket.\n\nJudge: Let me see your ticket.\n\nPlaintiff: So I left. And as I left, I see this one guy fighting with two, three bouncers. The police are there, people all in the parking lot. So now I’m going to my car. So, I did leave, and I went home. The following week, that was on a Saturday, they weren’t open on Sunday. When I called, they weren’t open. So the following Friday, I go back.\n\nJudge: So you left it there on Saturday. You come back on Friday.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I did forget my ticket that Friday.\n\nJudge: So as long as you have your ticket, nothing will go wrong.\n\nPlaintiff: I did forget my ticket, but I explained what happened to the girls at the coat check. They did show me two coats that were there, but they were not my coat. So I did speak to the manager.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Tom. Tom said to me, \"Leave your name, your number. Just bring me your ticket, and we’ll give you your coat.\"\n\nJudge: But there are only two coats there. Neither of them are yours. What were they going to do? Where would your coat have been?\n\nPlaintiff: I came back for the third time. This time, I came back with my husband. Tom still didn’t have the coat.\n\nJudge: Was your husband with you the night of the club?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. I take it that it was a girl’s night, and everything was fine; otherwise, you wouldn’t be bringing him with you for the coat check.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So how do you protect yourself when you check an expensive coat at a coat check?\n\nDefendant: The ticket does state that we are not responsible for items left overnight.\n\nJudge: Then you shouldn’t take them. But they didn’t keep them overnight; you left it overnight.\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: That’s the problem. My job is to abide by the law. Once it doesn’t get settled between you two, I have one call to make. Are they legally obligated? No.\n\nJudge: I have to rule in favor of the club.

{"id": "369", "dialogue": "Judge: Parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. The plaintiff says she fronted the defendant money for a trip to Disney World while the defendant was dating her daughter. But they broke up, and now she wants her money back. The defendant says the trip was always considered a gift, and this is just revenge. It’s the case of \"You’re Freaking Goofy.\"\n\nJudge: Okay, Lynn Smith, you are suing your daughter's former boyfriend, Thomas Foy, for $491.60 that you say you are out and that he owes you for a trip that he ended up not taking with your daughter, but that you had fronted money for.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. How long did they date?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, for six years, I guess.\n\nJudge: That's a long time. How old are you guys?\n\nDefendant: I'm 25.\n\nJudge: Oh, and you're so young. All right, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, Chrissy had asked Tom if he'd like to join us when we went to Disney World for our trip on March 10, 2012. We told him how much it would cost him.\n\nJudge: What kind of trip was this? Tell me about it.\n\nPlaintiff: It was a vacation trip. You know, the family went.\n\nJudge: Who else was involved?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, my daughter and her husband, my grandchildren, my son and his wife. There were a lot of us.\n\nJudge: Okay, so your nuclear family and their significant others.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He had said he didn’t have the money upfront because there were due dates to pay for the airline and the deposit.\n\nJudge: Who did he say that to?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, he told Chrissy.\n\nJudge: Come on up, Chrissy. Okay, tell me about it.\n\nChrissy: He said that he wanted to go. He agreed that he would have the money by the end of February. He and my mom talked about it, and they came to the agreement that he would have the money by then.\n\nJudge: So did he ask her to front it?\n\nPlaintiff: I spoke with him.\n\nJudge: Tell me about your conversation with him.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, she and Tom were in front of me in our hallway, and I said, \"You know, I'd be willing to put the money on my credit card as long as he had everything paid—the final payment—by the end of February before we left.\" And he agreed.\n\nJudge: Okay, and after six years, you had no reason not to trust him?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, let's see…\n\nJudge: Okay, how’d that work out for you?\n\nPlaintiff: So that was the beginning of January. I guess we just ended up breaking up, and it was a very awkward situation because the trip was booked.\n\nJudge: How did you guys break up?\n\nDefendant: Painfully and torturously. It was kind of strange; we just stopped talking.\n\nJudge: After six years?\n\nDefendant: Well, we had been on and off for six years. Our relationship was kind of like that.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go on.\n\nChrissy: Then I had to… My mom was asking me, \"Oh, well, what's going on with the trip?\" So I texted him, and he said, \"Oh, I have to see. I might have a fireman test during that time. I'll have to see if I can change the date.\"\n\nJudge: So, was the premise that if the fireman test could be changed, he would still go on the trip even though you two had broken up?\n\nChrissy: Yeah, I guess. I mean, we were still negotiating. It wouldn’t be the first time we got back together after breaking up.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you were still negotiating. Go ahead.\n\nChrissy: Then he texted me the next morning and said, \"That's it. I can't go.\"\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nChrissy: I said, \"Okay, well then you owe me the money that my mom up fronted for you for the airline ticket.\"\n\nJudge: Now, was it everything? Because you were able to cancel something, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I called Disney and the airline. With Disney, everything was canceled except the $200 non-refundable deposit for the room. The airline ticket was non-refundable, but he can use it until January 2, 2013.\n\nJudge: Mr. Foy, what do you have to say about all this?\n\nDefendant: As far as what?\n\nJudge: As far as the trial that you're on the People's Court for. What do you think?\n\nDefendant: I don’t mind paying for the airline ticket because it’s in my name, but they’re also charging me for the hotel room, which I wasn’t going to be in by myself.\n\nJudge: But you haven't paid anything. So tell me, was it a bad breakup?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nJudge: Then why didn’t you pay anything?\n\nDefendant: I just didn’t have the money for it.\n\nJudge: Let's discuss the hotel charge. The original arrangement was that Christine was in my room. I had to change the reservation when he joined, and when he canceled, I had to scramble to get her back into my room.\n\nJudge: I find that you are liable for the amount she’s asking for.

{"id": "110", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The Plaintiff says the Defendant was a creepy landlord who charged him every time he had someone spend the night and even spied on him. But the Defendant says the guy only moved because he tried to save his marriage. It’s the case of ‘Who’s Been Sleeping in My Bed?’\n\nJudge: Alexander Petrov, you are suing DeAndre Zephyr, your former landlord, for $1,840, representing the return of your security deposit, some extra utilities you feel you shouldn’t have had to pay for, and pain and suffering. You are counterclaiming against him for the rest of his lease because, according to you, he broke it early without reason. Talk to me—what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I moved in in January of this year. What happened was, he originally told me that utilities were included. But as time went on, he decided he could charge me extra for them.\n\nJudge: Why do you agree if they were—what did your lease say?\n\nPlaintiff: According to the lease, they were included.\n\nJudge: Really? Because I looked at your lease, and it says electricity paid by tenant and owner, right? Go look at it.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I don’t have a copy of the lease here.\n\nJudge: Then how do you know what ‘according to the lease’ it says?\n\nPlaintiff: In the agreement that we talked about, he told me it was included as part of the agreement. There were four people who lived there, including himself, and $160 a month is too much for a single room.\n\nJudge: You mean in rent?\n\nPlaintiff: No, for the utilities. Just for the utilities.\n\nJudge: Do you have a copy of your lease?\n\nPlaintiff: I do not.\n\nJudge: Where’s your copy of the lease?\n\nPlaintiff: I only have receipts for the things that he charged.\n\nJudge: Do you have a copy of the lease?\n\nDefendant: Yes. May I see it?\n\nJudge: (Reading) ‘Owner will provide services which are required by law. The following services and utilities are the responsibility of the renter unless otherwise indicated below: electricity—owner/tenant, gas—owner, water—owner, cable TV—owner, telephone—tenant, air conditioner—tenant.’ It’s all actually spelled out in the lease. So, he comes to you for your half or whatever, a portion you felt was too big?\n\nPlaintiff: When I confronted him about it, I told him, ‘This is too much to be charged for a single month for a single room.’ He said, ‘Can I just pay him the $160, or he would kick me out.’\n\nJudge: But why don’t you just look at—do you have the electricity bill?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: What were you charging him for?\n\nDefendant: The bill was $400. It was split evenly among the household members. His portion was the same as everyone else’s—$60.\n\nJudge: You didn’t want to get kicked out. Were you going through a divorce or separation?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So, you didn’t want to relocate, and you paid the money. What else was a problem?\n\nPlaintiff: He made me do chores around the house—mopping, sweeping the common areas, washing the bathroom—even though other roommates didn’t have to do anything.\n\nJudge: Did you have a whip or something?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. We all had rotating chores. Everyone cleaned on weekends.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: He would knock on my door and say, ‘Hey Alex, why didn’t you take out the garbage? Why didn’t you do this?’ Even when I had guests over.\n\nJudge: You and your wife are back together?\n\nPlaintiff: We’re working on it, but I’m living with her.\n\nDefendant: He told me he wanted to reconcile with his wife. I asked why he signed a lease if he was trying to reconcile. He signed a lease for a year. After the year, I had no issue with him leaving.\n\nJudge: So, from the beginning, he told you he was trying to reconcile?\n\nDefendant: After 20 days, he changed his mind.\n\nJudge: What happened that made him leave?\n\nDefendant: One day, I saw his father in the house when he wasn’t there. That was the first incident. The second time, I said we should go our separate ways.\n\nJudge: So, you said that to him?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Then why do you have a counterclaim against him?\n\nDefendant: After he moved out, he accused me of stealing his camera and called the police. That’s when I counter-sued.\n\nJudge: But you found your camera, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Would you like to apologize?\n\nPlaintiff: I regret saying he stole my camera.\n\nJudge: If you told him to leave, you can’t sue for rent. I’m ordering the return of $750 for the security deposit. As for utilities—no. As for pain and suffering—no. And for your counterclaim—zero.

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says he knows the 89-year-old driver hit his car in the VA parking lot. But the defendant says the plaintiff is dreaming it up. It’s the case of Car Wars.\n\nJudge Marilyn Milian: Allan Hayatt?\n\nPlaintiff (Allan Hayatt): Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge Milian: You are suing David Lieberwitz for $2,113 to fix your car because, according to you, Mr. Lieberwitz hit your car.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge Milian: Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I parked my car outside the Veterans Hospital on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn. I had an appointment. When I came out, there was damage to the back of my bumper. It was gouged and scratched and slightly ajar. I had checked the car before I went in—I always check the car when I park it—and there were no damages on the bumper.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay. Was Mr. Lieberwitz’s car parked behind yours?\n\nPlaintiff: It was parked behind me when I returned.\n\nJudge Milian: When you returned, was he in the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he was not.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay, so what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I waited for him to get into his car to make sure it was the right party. I came over to the window and told him that he struck the car in front of him.\n\nJudge Milian: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"I didn’t.\" I said, \"Well, come out and take a look at what you did.\" He came out, and at first, he saw nothing. I pointed it out to him.\n\nJudge Milian: Now, there was damage to your car that you say was fresh?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, ma’am.\n\nJudge Milian: And by fresh, you mean what?\n\nPlaintiff: Fresh meaning that there was paint on the bumper that wasn’t there when I parked the car.\n\nJudge Milian: Can I see the damage to your car? Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\n[Plaintiff hands over pictures.]\n\nJudge Milian: So, did you show that damage to him?\n\nPlaintiff: I pointed it out to him. At first, he didn’t see it and just scoffed it off as something he didn’t do.\n\nJudge Milian: Oh, wait—his bumper’s off. Is this your car?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m the gray car. He’s the white car.\n\nJudge Milian: His bumper is ripped off.\n\nPlaintiff: Right, but I don’t believe that it’s ripped off on the other side. It’s ripped off on the left side. This damage is on the right side—on my left, his right.\n\nJudge Milian: So that bumper came off some other way.\n\nPlaintiff: Probably.\n\nJudge Milian: Oh, Lord.\n\nDefendant (David Lieberwitz): I came over to my car, walked with my wife to my car, and he was taking pictures, movies. I said, \"What are you taking movies about?\" He says, \"You banged into my car.\"\n\nJudge Milian: What did you say?\n\nDefendant: I said, \"I never touched your car. Never.\"\n\nJudge Milian: Did you see him hit your car?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t see him, but I know he did it.\n\nDefendant: He didn’t see me, but I did it? How does that make sense?\n\nJudge Milian: I’m looking at the damage to his car and then looking at your car… scratches.\n\nDefendant: Two little scratches! You could barely see them.\n\nJudge Milian: No, I can see them pretty clearly, sir. These are the pictures of the damage to his car. What year is your car?\n\nDefendant: 2010.\n\nJudge Milian: 2010 what?\n\nDefendant: Toyota Corolla.\n\nJudge Milian: Did you hit his car?\n\nDefendant: No!\n\nJudge Milian: Sir, your bumper is hanging off. How did that happen?\n\nDefendant: I had an accident about two weeks before this happened, but believe me, the bumper never touched him.\n\nJudge Milian: Here’s a picture he took of the damage on the right side of your car, which is gray in color—the color of his car.\n\nDefendant: But that has nothing to do with this!\n\nJudge Milian: So you've been driving for how long?\n\nDefendant: I’m 89 years old and I’ve been driving since I was 17.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay, do you think there should be an age cut-off for drivers?\n\nSpectator: Yes, I would say about 88 to 90.\n\nJudge Milian: What about you?\n\nSpectator 2: I agree, 88 to 90.\n\nJudge Milian: Anybody think there should be no age cut-off?\n\nSpectator 3: My aunt is 94, still driving a 1969 El Camino just fine. The problem is she doesn’t know where she’s driving!\n\n[Laughter]\n\nJudge Milian: Sir, you have to admit that as people get older, their reflexes aren’t the same. If I have his car with no damage, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, and I have fresh paint on both cars, what am I supposed to conclude?\n\nDefendant: Throw the case out!\n\nJudge Milian: That’s not happening today. Maybe you should retake the driving test. My dad did. Then he walked into the house, slammed his new license on the table, and told me to shut up!\n\n[Laughter]\n\nJudge Milian: Based on what I have in front of me, I find in favor of the plaintiff for the full $2,113.

You go out and you find that this is beautiful. How did you design this dress? Did he design it? Did you see it in a magazine? What was that?\n\nPlaintiff: I had designed it in my head and then I met with him and he drew it out for me.\n\nJudge: Okay, and tell me about the dress. Is it a top and a bottom separate?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it's one dress and then it's kind of like a cape that comes around to the front that buttons up so it drags on the bottom.\n\nJudge: So it's like a train?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, that’s detachable.\n\nJudge: Okay.

And then by the time she got home, the whole thing had dragged.\n\nJudge: Yeah, this was the first hole when she left.\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: So I was like, \"This hole is not...\" If it's just...\n\nJudge: Did you hand-stitch this?\n\nDefendant: No, it was machine-stitched.\n\nJudge: So when she left, it was this hole. So I was like, \"This hole is fine, it's not that... Just don't take off your cape.\"\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: That was kind of the idea, that she should be able to take it off.\n\nJudge: Yeah. So she's fine, but then...\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: Then the unthinkable happened.

I want to say that's when it started ripping.\n\nJudge: I would have stapled it.\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: You would have stapled it?\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nJudge: So what happened, Mr. Bazarus?\n\nDefendant: Well, I made the prom dress. She came over for the fitting, and she paid 600.\n\nJudge: Oh, is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff’s Mother: Yes.\n\nJudge: Is that including the fabric or no?\n\nDefendant: That’s including the fabric, yes. Everything, the fabric and all. So I made the dress. She comes over for fitting and it fits, everything works out beautiful. She loved the dress, and they take the dress.\n\nJudge: When do you get the messages that there's a problem?\n\nDefendant: It was the day of the prom. And that’s when they sent me a picture of the dress via text and a video, I believe, also.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then what?\n\nDefendant: That’s when I said, \"Okay, I don’t know what happened, what transpired there.\" I said, \"Could it be that maybe the way she put it on, maybe the stitch could have popped?\" Because it's a fashion-fitted dress.\n\nJudge: Listen, it's a fitted dress. You know it’s a fitted dress. You know the stitching has to be done in a way that something like this doesn't happen. Because it's not meant to happen. Your last fitting was when?\n\nPlaintiff: The day before prom.\n\nJudge: Yeah. So it’s not like the last fitting was a month earlier and she gained weight. There's no reason for this to happen. You and I both know that.\n\nJudge: So, you’re suing for 600 that you paid for the dress, right? Because you’re never going to wear that dress again. And you want 400 for repairs and 100 for gas. That’s a lot of money.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You should be compensated, but let’s be fair. Mr. Bazarus, did you agree to pay 200 and fix the dress?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but I got busy with personal matters.\n\nJudge: You got busy? That’s not a reason to ignore someone. That’s why you got sued. I find in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of 250 plus court costs, and the defendant must repair the dress.

May I see the paperwork?\n\nDefendant:\nI don’t have the actual title that I gave him, but I have a duplicate. I have a title for another car that is similar in paper.\n\nJudge:\nI don’t want that. I know what a salvage title looks like. I want to know if you have any proof of conveying to this man that the car was salvaged.\n\nWhat does \"salvage\" mean? That has a specific meaning.\n\nDefendant:\nIt means it was in an accident and repaired.\n\nJudge:\nNo, no, no. It means it was totaled and repaired. Right? There’s a difference between being in an accident and a salvage title.\n\nI have a car that’s been in an accident and repaired, but it’s not a salvage title because of that. A salvage title means it was considered a total loss and repaired. Right?\n\nDefendant:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. When did you discover it was salvaged?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA year and three months later.\n\nJudge:\nA year and three months later?\n\nHow did you register the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe registered it for me.\n\nJudge:\nSo when the title came in the mail, did you receive one that said “Salvage”?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOne month later, yes.\n\nJudge:\nWhere’s your title? Can I see it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I have a copy here.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Why doesn’t the paperwork state it clearly?\n\nDefendant:\nIt was a verbal thing, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOh, watch this. It was a verbal thing. That’s an easy one.\n\nDid he ever tell you it was a salvage before you bought it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you first learn it was a salvage?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA year and four months later.\n\nJudge:\nOnly because you didn’t read? Because the title came to you a few months later?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. What problems have you had with the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe CD player didn’t work. I brought it back to him; he took care of it.\n\nTwo months later, my wife noticed leakage through the roof.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have the car now?\n\nPlaintiff’s Wife:\nYes, the suspension is really bad.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. You come to court, and you're suing for what?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe amount I paid for the car plus what I paid for repairs.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would I order him to pay you all that stuff back while you keep driving the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause I was misled.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t sue for almost two years. What made you sue now?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA lawyer told me he broke state and federal laws.\n\nJudge:\nThe tricky part is that Kelley Blue Book doesn’t allow you to factor in a salvage title.\n\nThe only person who knows the real loss value is him, and I don’t trust him.\n\nI believe you didn’t know it was salvage. He violated state and federal law by not disclosing it properly.\n\nI am going to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff $4,000.\n\nThat’s my verdict.

{"id": "814", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket - the plaintiff says the defendant told his girl he could fix his van, took it and then disappeared. The defendant says the girl abandoned the van and he did nothing with it. It's the case of Van Gone. Have been sworn, your honor. Thank you. Osman Fon Perez, you are suing Errol Cunningham for $5,000, the cost of a van you say you lost because of him - repairs to the van, money that you put into the van, insurance, parking tickets, etc. You are counter claiming $500 for work done inspecting the van, okay? All right, what happened?\nPlaintiff: Um, my girlfriend owns a daycare in Brooklyn. Mr. Earl Cunningham was the driver who worked there.\nJudge: Okay. Stand up please. Did you know him before?\nPlaintiff: No, I didn't know him before.\nJudge: And how long was he working for you?\nPlaintiff: I would say about a little over a year.\nJudge: And then what happens?\nPlaintiff: Um, I started having a problem with my van and which she has a van similar to mine so he said he knows how-\nJudge: Whose van is it?\nPlaintiff: It's my van.\nJudge: Where's it registered?\nPlaintiff: It's registered in New York state.\nJudge: In your name?\nPlaintiff: In my name, yes.\nJudge: Okay, go on.\nPlaintiff: So I had a problem, the car like wouldn't start so he said he knows how to fix the van because he too has the same similar van. And so he came and got the van and then he said it would take about two weeks. So two weeks came, I called him, he said it wasn't ready, he has to change a distributor and then it went on and on for weeks and then he wouldn't-\nJudge: Why did you just take it back?\nPlaintiff: It wouldn't start when I went to get it.\nJudge: So he broke it?\nPlaintiff: I don't know. I was in conversation with her while this was happening and every time that we would try to go get it - like one day I got frustrated and I told her just go there with your sister and get it and tow it, and at that time is when he said he had lost the key to it and he had to make a key for it. Then he took the license plate off of it. He started getting a bunch of tickets, the car's got you know about $800 and change-\nJudge: You have the tickets?\nPlaintiff: No, I don't have the tickets.\nJudge: How do you come to court empty-handed like that?\nPlaintiff: I forgot the paperwork but-\nJudge: How do you forget that one thing you're supposed to bring?\nPlaintiff: I did- I mean I have no defense as far as forgetting that part.\nJudge: Where were you while all this was going on?\nPlaintiff: I was incarcerated.\nJudge: What were you incarcerated for?\nPlaintiff: Um, Medicaid fraud.\nJudge: How long were you in?\nPlaintiff: Uh, nine months and 20 days but who's counting.\nJudge: The passenger van goes over there while you're in custody?\nPlaintiff: Yes, it was given to him to fix because normally me and my mechanic that I brought here today fix it ourselves but what happened was since I wasn't around we trusted him to do this. This gentleman has just disappeared with the- I just don't understand-\nJudge: How many months was it over there?\nPlaintiff: Well to today it's been a year, uh close to a year.\nJudge: I'm just not getting it. You don't have a spare key to go pick it up?\nPlaintiff: No, we don't have a spare key.\nJudge: And you don't just get pay a locksmith 100 bucks and get the van?\nPlaintiff: We couldn't find the van after he said that it had been towed.\nJudge: But how many months was it parked there before it was towed?\nPlaintiff: About four or five months.\nJudge: That's the part I don't understand. You understand why I don't- I understand why you weren't going to get it right? I just don't understand why she wasn't- she was trying-\nDefendant: He kept saying that that he-\nJudge: Why she buying it over and over? She's 24 years old- well what are you doing with a 24-year-old who can't figure her way out of a paper bag? What's going on?\nDefendant: They brought the van to me-\nJudge: They brought it to you or you drove it to your-\nDefendant: And the gentleman there-\nJudge: The one with the dread?\nDefendant: Okay, they brought the van to- come on up a second. I thought that- who is this gentleman here?\nPlaintiff: Your mechanic.\nJudge: He's the mechanic and the person who had- how did the van get to him?\nMechanic: Oh we drove it to him.\nJudge: You guys- you two drove it there?\nMechanic: Yeah.\nJudge: And if you're a mechanic why were you driving it to him?\nMechanic: Because the problems I didn't know how to fix them like that.\nJudge: Well okay. All right so you're both alley mechanics right? Okay, you're not working for a particular- okay. All right so then you're just out of the picture after that. Okay go ahead and have a seat.\nJudge: All right so go on.\nDefendant: They take it to me, I checked the van out and everything. I told her what was wrong with the van as far as I see-\nJudge: What was wrong with it?\nDefendant: The distributor. After- see I put the- in and I had the van running then I saw it wasn't idling properly and it was smoking. I said- and I call her and I tell her is the heads gone in the van. I said come and pick the van up, she never did come and get the van. One day her and some of the girl came in the car and I said why don't you take the van- she want me to drive with the Queens. I said no I'm not driving no van the Queens. Take the van because the inspection sticker were off and the van and that's the reason why I removed the plate because it was getting tickets.\nJudge: What made you think that removing the plates-\nDefendant: It was not getting ticket after I removed the plates.\nJudge: No, it got tolded.\nDefendant: Yeah, it got tolded.\nJudge: Had that work out for- I got- I had the idea to remove the plat so it would stop getting tickets and then it ends up getting towed. How many months was it parked in- in front of your place?\nDefendant: It parked there for almost 6 months.\nJudge: Wait, is that true? Why didn't she pick it up?\nPlaintiff: We tried to pick it up when he went with- when she went with that girl and that's when the keys were missing.\nJudge: Where's the key right now?\nDefendant: I don't know where the key is.\nJudge: Why would you bring it to court?\nDefendant: I didn't know how to bring it-\nPlaintiff: Cuz he's lying-\nJudge: That would make such perfect sense though if you brought the key then I'd know then I'd say you're lying to her right?\nDefendant: I'm not- I'm not lying.\nJudge: Well you're the guy who didn't bring the tickets so I would not like bobblehead and say exactly-\nPlaintiff: No you're right, you're right I- but he did say that he lost the key. He's lying about that.\nJudge: Who's the gentleman who's with you - moral support or a witness?\nWitness: That's a witness.\nJudge: Come on up. So if somebody leaves a van or whatnot on your property for 6 months and never picks it up have they abandoned it?\nWitness: Yeah I think if you leave something in my house for 2 weeks I'm not going to take care of your trash.\nJudge: What's a magic number? What is the magic number for how long somebody leaves something in your house before it becomes yours essentially?\nWitness: Uh just a few weeks. You can't be free storage for everybody else.\nJudge: Do you have to tell them I'm going to basically take this property now if you don't pick it up?\nWitness: I think you do.\nJudge: I think you've got to let them know you're going to get rid of it and you give them what a reasonable time - 30 days fair enough? Going inside the courtroom what are you a witness to?\nWitness: Oh when Errol had the van he did call Tasha, tell her to come get the van a lot of times. Tasha would never come get the van. I told her also to get the van.\nJudge: You did?\nWitness: Yes, to get the van from Errol and then Tasha would say I'll wait till Osman comes back to deal with it. I don't feel like dealing with it.\nPlaintiff: That's a lie cuz we didn't know where Osman was at, didn't know he was incarcerated. He was on vacation in Panama - that's what we were told.\nJudge: For 9 months?\nPlaintiff: Yeah working in Panama.\nWitness: Who's coming next month?\nPlaintiff: True that is true. I was not wanting for them to know where I was at so he- that's that party saying the truth.\nJudge: Listen, yes your honor, people go to prison and it's frustrating because you rely on other people to take care of your business. You're absolutely right and um all of a sudden now you come out it's a year later and you're demanding to know where the van is and what's going on and everything else but meanwhile you were out and according to your own testimony didn't do anything for four or five month-\nPlaintiff: I trusted him-\nJudge: No, who does that? It sounds- it smacks of you don't feel like dealing with it and then I have those two guys saying I told her to pick it up she's just lazy and she wanted me to drive it to Queens and I wasn't going to do that and- and- and I got to tell you your conduct sort of sounds like that because it's inexplicable what is the reason that it didn't get picked up and there's no good answer and when there's no good answer and that side has a great answer and it's cuz she's lazy she just never got around to picking it up and then there's nothing to pick up because after 6 months of sitting there it got towed.\nPlaintiff: We tried to pick it up. He kept coming up with excuses. He would not answer the phone we tried to-\nJudge: He denies that. It's your word against his. Show me the emails that you sent them or the text that you sent them saying I keep trying to pick it up and you don't- show me something.\nPlaintiff: It's- it's okay I mean is it- is it over there with the tickets?\nJudge: No you know what- you know you just have no proof. Okay in any event you got a counter claim- you got to be kidding for what?\nDefendant: Yeah for my time coming out here- 500 of the time I been check the van out. I never get paid for checking the van.\nJudge: Hey you make $500 a day?\nDefendant: Yes I do.\nJudge: Yeah prove it.\nJudge: And actually what it says it's for inspecting the van- you didn't even fix the van-\nDefendant: I told them the van didn't had no inspection that's what I told the-\nJudge: The answer is no on the counter claim.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion,playing the victim, gaslighting, emtional appeal"}
{"id": "586", "dialogue": "Judge: Ms. Budker, you are suing Dennis Dugan, your former architect, for $800, a return of a deposit that you gave him for some drawings. Mr. Dugan, you’re counterclaiming for the remaining balance that you say is owed for those drawings, which is $1,612. Let me hear from you. You have a home in what town?\n\nPlaintiff: We have a home in Forest Hills Gardens, which is—I brought as an exhibit to show you—a preserved community historic district.\n\nJudge: This is Forest Hills Gardens in New York?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, in New York.\n\nJudge: All right, so you had a house, and you had a balcony, and…?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a picture of my home with the extension. I filed an application to put a roof over the balcony.\n\nJudge: And when you filed your application to put a roof over the balcony, they told you to get an architect?\n\nPlaintiff: I was initially allowed to file first. I would like to give you a short presentation about how Forest Hills Gardens Corporation works very strictly on architecture and construction procedures.\n\nJudge: I understand, but that’s not in dispute. So, they told you that you need to get an architect and submit proper drawings?\n\nPlaintiff: Not at first. Initially, I submitted a sketch done by Joseph.\n\nJudge: And what did they say?\n\nPlaintiff: Then, I decided that I needed an architect, and I was suggested to hire Mr. Dugan.\n\nJudge: All right. Mr. Dugan, how long have you been an architect?\n\nDefendant: I retired this year.\n\nJudge: How long were you in practice before that?\n\nDefendant: 48 years.\n\nJudge: Oh, my goodness. Did you have a written retainer agreement with her?\n\nDefendant: Yes, may I provide it?\n\nJudge: Yes, please. [Examines document] According to the written retainer, you were charging $200 an hour?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: The agreement states that you would inform her in eight-hour increments of your time and bill her accordingly?\n\nDefendant: Yes, meaning I would notify her before accruing additional hours to prevent costs from getting out of hand.\n\nJudge: And you billed her on a monthly basis?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So what did you do for them?\n\nDefendant: We had an initial meeting where we signed the contract. They paid my retainer.\n\nJudge: So they paid $800?\n\nDefendant: That’s correct. Then they provided some documents for me to use as a base for my plans, which I would then submit to the architectural committee for approval. I’ve done 12 to 15 submissions for different clients in Forest Hills. Only one has ever been approved on the first try.\n\nJudge: Did you explain that to your clients?\n\nDefendant: Yes, of course.\n\nJudge: The denial from the committee stated that they unanimously rejected the design because they felt it made the house look too heavy. They said it exaggerated the asymmetry of the house.\n\nDefendant: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: When did you send them the bill for the remaining amount? Before or after the rejection?\n\nDefendant: Shortly after, I think.\n\nJudge: Wouldn't it have been a better idea to send the bill before the rejection?\n\nDefendant: Not really. Normally, I get paid as the work is done.\n\nJudge: Did you know it wasn’t going to get approved?\n\nDefendant: I suspected they would have objections, but that’s typical. I assumed we would work through their concerns.\n\nJudge: Did you explain that to her?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nDefendant: We met again, and she started berating my prior work for another client, calling me incompetent and stupid. I told her we couldn’t continue working together if this was the tone.\n\nJudge: So, you sent your bill after she called you incompetent?\n\nDefendant: I don’t recall exactly.\n\nJudge: Ms. Budker, why do you feel that he should return the $800, and you should not have to pay the remaining balance?\n\nPlaintiff: After our first meeting, we signed a contract for the design phase. According to the guidelines, there was supposed to be a review and suggestions from the board before the formal meeting.\n\nJudge: Where is that written?\n\nPlaintiff: In the rules and regulations.\n\nJudge: Show me exactly where it states that the board will meet with him before he submits the design.\n\nPlaintiff: [Hands over documents] Preliminary review.\n\nJudge: [Reads document] That just outlines submission requirements. When did all this happen?\n\nPlaintiff: 2014.\n\nJudge: So, four years ago?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Mr. Dugan, what is the normal procedure after a denial?\n\nDefendant: They set up a subcommittee to discuss the drawings and figure out modifications needed for approval.\n\nJudge: Did you ever get another architect?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because he never did what we wanted. He submitted his own design without discussing it with us.\n\nJudge: He can’t submit anything without your approval. This is what he drew. Someone altered it with a pen. Who did that?\n\nPlaintiff: My husband.\n\nJudge: Okay, so your husband marked changes, and then he followed them?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he never showed us the final submission.\n\nJudge: Mr. Dugan, is there any requirement for a preliminary discussion with the board before submission?\n\nDefendant: No, that’s not how it works.\n\nJudge: Ms. Budker, you seem to believe there was an informal review required. Where is that documented?\n\nPlaintiff: He promised to do it.\n\nJudge: Let me see the letter. [Reads] \"At our meeting yesterday, Ann’s words describing my work and me personally made me realize that you have lost confidence in my ability. Therefore, now is the time to end our agreement and go our separate ways.\" This suggests he left because of how he was treated, not because he refused to continue the work.\n\nJudge: My ruling is as follows: The plaintiff’s lawsuit for the return of the deposit is denied. Work was performed, and just because the outcome was not what the plaintiff wanted does not mean the defendant does not deserve to be paid. The plaintiff is ordered to pay an additional $800 to Mr. Dugan. Case closed.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "exxageration, emotional appeal"}
{"id": "650", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Douglas. George Stewart, you’re suing your former landlord, Gabriella Baragan, for $1,400 that you say she owes you and is wrongfully withholding. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Um, what happened? I've rented the apartment from her from 2012, and from the time I rented the apartment for all these years, I never had any heat. The only time the heat comes up is like 3 days before the end of the month, and after I pay her my rent, two days after, the heat goes again. I kept on complaining time after time, time after time. My wife had to move out because of no heat. My daughter started to get sick. My son started to get sick because of no heat. The place was cold.\n\nJudge: Had you lived there for 4 years like that? Why didn’t you just call 311?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason why is because I'm new in the country. I don't understand a lot of things. We are poor. We don't know what to do. Nobody told us what to do, so I guess now… okay.\n\nJudge: How much was your rent?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,400.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you’d given her $1,400 security?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave her—I have the receipt here for the first $1,000 security.\n\nJudge: Yes. Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I have some pictures here. May I?\n\nJudge: Yes, of course.\n\nPlaintiff: This is a picture of the bathtub. It was clogged up for a month, and I couldn't show her no shower for a month. I had to shower at other people’s places.\n\nJudge: But what are you taking a picture of here? It's not clogged in this picture. What are you doing?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s draining. It slowly drained away.\n\nJudge: Okay, that’s hard to see in a picture. What is this a picture of?\n\nPlaintiff: The window of my daughter. There was mold on the window because of the heat. You can see the windows. It’s sweat. It’s all because of no heat, and the place is cold. You can see all the mold. That’s the reason why my son got sick. I have the receipt here for his sickness. I have a receipt here for thousands of dollars.\n\nJudge: Why is the window wet like that?\n\nPlaintiff: Because of no heat, and the place is cold. You can see all the mold.\n\nDefendant: Did you see this when this happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He told me like a month after. The daughter always stayed in her room. It was always closed. He never told me about it, and I sent somebody right away to fix it, but there was heat. There was a six-family building, and there was heat there. Everybody complained of being too hot, and he was the only one who complained that it was cold. I don’t understand.\n\nJudge: Okay, does everyone have a separate meter?\n\nDefendant: No, there’s only one thermometer, which is in the hallway, and there’s no way to control one place. The whole building was heated.\n\nJudge: So, what was causing this mold?\n\nDefendant: I sent somebody to fix it, but I don’t know why it was there. They put some kind of chemicals on it. They probably repainted it, but why was there mold to begin with?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. It was too humid, maybe? Because they never opened the window. It was always closed. The door was closed, and they never opened the window.\n\nJudge: That shouldn’t happen just because your door is closed. There has to be some leak or something wrong. I don’t know. Anyway, so you fixed it. Did you ever hear from him again?\n\nDefendant: No, just the one time.\n\nJudge: And did you have to fix it multiple times in four years?\n\nDefendant: Just the one time.\n\nJudge: And when did you get a call about that? Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, or Year 4?\n\nDefendant: No, it was about the last year when they were leaving.\n\nJudge: Do you have any evidence of ever having complained about the heat before you're trying to get your security deposit back?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, I do. Do you have an email to her, a text to her, anything showing that you’ve been complaining about the heat throughout four years?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a lot of texts, but on the phone…\n\nJudge: Do they say what I’m asking?\n\nPlaintiff: I can’t remember. I know I take a look at them. I kept on texting her.\n\nJudge: She says that’s not true. So I want to see evidence that you’re telling the truth. While you’re looking for that, let me ask you: Why is it you won’t return his security deposit?\n\nDefendant: First of all, it wasn’t the reason why I didn’t return the deposit. It was because he said that he was going to move out, and I said okay, but you have to let me show the apartment to the new people that are going to rent it. So he said okay. The first time when I went there to show the apartment, it was so dirty, I couldn’t even go in. I said no, I can’t.\n\nDefendant: It smelled like feet and greasy feet, cheesy feet, greasy—I don’t know. It was greasy.\n\nDefendant: I told him, \"You gotta keep it a little nicer and clean so we can show it.\" He said, “I don’t feel comfortable with you going in with other people in my place, and I can’t let you show it anymore. But don’t worry, I’ll keep it clean and give it back to you when I leave.” I said okay, because I couldn’t show it like this.\n\nDefendant: By the end of the month when you had the lease with him?\n\nDefendant: It was already over. He was leaving, but he had to let you show it.\n\nJudge: Yes. That’s not like you just have to. His rights as a tenant are to have you plan it, and not surprise him. Your right as a landlord is to show it. You don’t have to eat a month's rent when a tenant leaves.\n\nJudge: So, he moves out. What condition, according to you, did he leave it in?\n\nDefendant: You can see the pictures. Let me show you.\n\nJudge: Were you able to find any text or emails to her that say, \"We have no heat. You need to fix this,\" anything like that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no texts.\n\nJudge: Okay, because what I would be the first thing I would say if I lived in New Rochelle and didn’t have heat.\n\nDefendant: The kitchen—supposed to be white. But it’s just dirty.\n\nJudge: What’s that? Where the door, but what? Was it burned or just dirty?\n\nDefendant: It was just dirty. Greasy.\n\nJudge: It’s cleaned off?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it came off with Clorox.\n\nJudge: What’s that?\n\nDefendant: The doors.\n\nJudge: Yes, but what happened to the walls?\n\nDefendant: That's how the walls were.\n\nJudge: Okay, but this isn’t $1,400. Why are you keeping $1,400?\n\nDefendant: Because I repainted.\n\nDefendant: No, I told him I was going to give him the rest after the lady cleaned it.\n\nJudge: How do you justify keeping $1,000?\n\nDefendant: I replaced the rug in the room.\n\nJudge: How new was the carpet?\n\nDefendant: I installed it when he moved in.\n\nJudge: Do you have a picture of the dirty carpet?\n\nDefendant: Yes, that one with my sneakers over there.\n\nJudge: Were you able to have it professionally cleaned?\n\nDefendant: No, I replaced it.\n\nJudge: But you don't get to refurbish the place whenever a tenant leaves. You have to be able to show what it cost you to clean the place. It’s disgusting.\n\nDefendant: I did everything myself. The lady, I paid cash for her.\n\nJudge: How much did you pay?\n\nDefendant: About $300.\n\nJudge: Did you do everything yourself?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I paid her cash.\n\nJudge: How long did she spend there to make $300?\n\nDefendant: About three days.\n\nJudge: Did you rerent the place?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I lost the month's rent because I had to do all this cleaning.\n\nJudge: But why did you lose a whole month?\n\nDefendant: Because if it took three days to clean, then it took three days to clean.\n\nJudge: But who’s going to start in the middle of the month?\n\nDefendant: I mean, people rent on the 15th, but I couldn’t rent it.\n\nJudge: Okay. I’m going to let you keep $700, half of the security deposit, but I’m going to order you to return the other $700 to him. The place was filthy, and it needed to be cleaned up. It took a certain amount of time, but if you weren't able to rent it, part of the reason why is because you decided not to touch it until he got out.\n\nJudge: So I’m not going to entertain your claim for the security deposit for that other month, but I am going to allow you to keep $700, because it really was disgusting. Now, you had offered to return $400 to him, right? And he didn’t want to take it. I’m going to order you return $700. That’s my verdict.

If she owed me for car insurance, I would track that too.\n\nJudge:\nSo how is this $1,800 made up of?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nAt the end of the relationship, there was a balance of $2,295, but I reduced it to $2,000, and she signed a promissory note.\n\nJudge:\nCan I see the promissory note?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nHere it is. She also made a $500 payment towards the $2,000 balance.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nI believe this was when he was holding my car hostage. He said I owed him money, and I couldn’t get my car. He could have written anything on that envelope.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you stop borrowing money then? You wouldn’t have had this issue.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nWe were in a relationship, and money was going back and forth.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean by back and forth?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nI paid for a lot of things. We lived together, so he paid the bills, and I gave him cash.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever pay for his car or anything like that?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nHe never paid for my car. I was under his insurance, but I paid for the vehicle myself.\n\nJudge:\nDo you owe him any money now?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nI do not believe I owe him anything.\n\nJudge:\nAre you sure about that?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, I’m sure. I paid him everything I owed.\n\nJudge:\nDid you sign the promissory note?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, but I was just trying to get him to leave me alone.\n\nJudge:\nWhat else happened during your breakup?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nShe was a heavy drinker. She would come home intoxicated and even drove her car into my house. I suspected she was getting texts from someone else, but she wouldn’t let me see her phone. It escalated into an argument, and eventually, the police came, and they told her to leave my house.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nWhat he says and what actually happened are two different things. Yes, I chased after him when he grabbed my phone, but I didn’t do anything violent.\n\nJudge:\nDid you try to serve him with a restraining order?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, I tried three times, but I couldn’t serve him.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about the harassment.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nHe started harassing me after we broke up. I have emails, text messages, and a video of him driving around my sister's house and my job. He even called my employer and tried to get me fired, saying I was an alcoholic and a drug addict.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have proof of that?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, I have emails and a video. He would also send me messages about how this could have been our car or how I could have had his new car.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you get the DUI?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nI got it on May 17th.\n\nJudge:\nWas that after you broke up?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, it was after we broke up.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened with the car?\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nIt was towed to his house, and I was in the hospital having surgery when it happened. He put a picture of my car on Facebook and made humiliating comments.\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI was just trying to get the money she owed me.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nNo, you were just trying to get me back. That’s all it was.\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI moved on quickly after the breakup. I didn’t want anything to do with her anymore.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nWell, you certainly didn’t act like it.\n\nJudge:\nDo you think you have been harassing her?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI don’t believe so.\n\nJudge:\nYou texted her new husband, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nYes, but I didn’t beat him up. He came to my house, and I told him to leave.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nHe was stalking me. He drove by my job and called my supervisor.\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI was just trying to get him to leave me alone.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever send her a text saying, \"Come over, here’s my address\"?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nYes, I did.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI was trying to resolve things.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYou need to stop stalking me. You’re still doing it.\n\nJudge:\nI find that you owe him $2,000 for the debts, and you owe her $2,000 for harassment. This is my verdict: each of you leaves with nothing.\n\nPlaintiff (Pasqual Petrella):\nI lost. You win some, lose some.\n\nJudge:\nI think you're lying about not owing him money.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nI’m sure I don’t owe him anything.\n\nJudge:\nAs for the harassment, it's clear he has not stopped contacting you. You have video evidence, emails, and a history of him trying to interfere with your life.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nYes, I have plenty of evidence.\n\nJudge:\nI hope both of you move on now, and I encourage you to take the restraining order seriously.\n\nDefendant (Cory Judson):\nThank you, your honor.\n\nJudge:\nThat will be all.

What should it be, Audio or Oreo?\n\nDefendant: Oreo.\n\nJudge: How is it—why is it not a—alright. Oreo Cardona, Executive Vice President and your landlord. You’re suing him for $5,000 for moving expenses, a security deposit that wasn’t returned, loss of wages—but basically, you’re really mad about the security deposit not being returned. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Basically, it was a long winter, so there was a lot of snow and a lot of stuff accumulated.\n\nJudge: So you folks move into—is it an apartment or a house?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s an apartment.\n\nJudge: Okay. And the apartment is owned by him, and you had a very bad winter. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, there were pools of water on the roof, and we had very bad leaks.\n\nJudge: Did you complain to your landlord about the leaks? And were the leaks fixed?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they said they couldn’t address it because it was dangerous conditions on the roof. It was ice and whatever.\n\nJudge: So when the ice melted, did they address it?\n\nPlaintiff: They addressed it that spring, but by that time, mold had accumulated.\n\nJudge: In the spring?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and we emailed them, we called them, we let them know like, “Hey, you know, this is—we have two children here.”\n\nJudge: So were you seeing mold on the ceiling? Again, do you have pictures of it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, actually, we have the video of it.\n\nJudge: You have a video of it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Hold on. I have one here. I have this—I’ll just show this.\n\nDefendant: He has a video that’s just on the spot. It could be a picture, but nothing happening.\n\nJudge: Oh, it’s the leak. Oh, I can—I’m sorry, you are right. I can actually see the dripping water. It took a minute. You’ll see the pot—oh, that’s horrible. Yeah. Is that a red Solo cup, or—\n\nPlaintiff: No, that’s a—that’s a pot that you boil your pasta in. And that first waterline is the initial time where I dumped it.\n\nJudge: Inside the apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Alright. So at some point, you get frustrated and you call the city?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, she reported it.\n\nJudge: And when you call the city, you report it, and the city comes out. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: So they came back to the apartment to make sure that all the damages were fixed.\n\nJudge: Well, had the repair been made?\n\nPlaintiff: It was made, but now we have a new problem.\n\nJudge: And the new problem is?\n\nPlaintiff: That—did you make four apartments out of two?\n\nDefendant: We made one apartment out of two on each floor.\n\nJudge: When you bought the building, did you turn them into two on each floor for more money?\n\nDefendant: They were two—they were already there.\n\nJudge: So it already had a zoning violation.\n\nDefendant: It wasn’t a zoning violation.\n\nJudge: It had to be. Because the problem the city had that made you make them one is that there was only one egress on each floor.\n\nDefendant: I—I can explain that.\n\nJudge: Yeah?\n\nDefendant: That whole city block was torn down by the city of New York. So the only building left was that little building in the middle of that vast wasteland.\n\nJudge: How does the other buildings’ existence mean that there’s a method of egress for both apartments?\n\nDefendant: You climb up, you go to the roof, and you go to the next building if there’s a fire or a problem.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait, wait, wait. That is rich. You expect people, during a fire, to climb up—to where? Go where?\n\nDefendant: In the city of New York—\n\nJudge: Jump from building to building like they’re Superman?\n\nDefendant: In the city of New York, if you live next—\n\nJudge: Just stop.\n\nAlright, the bottom line is that the city said what you got going on is illegal, and they have to leave because you are not legally renting it out the way it is.\n\nDoes anybody have the document given to you by the city?\n\nPlaintiff: I do.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let’s see what both parties show me now.\n\nPlaintiff: That was the vacate order that was on our door.\n\nJudge: Illegal apartment. Yeah, just—alright. Illegal apartment, two legal Class A apartments subdivided. Yeah, it’s not this fancy footwork about all the other buildings and jumping from building to building. It’s the bottom line—it’s the same thing that always happens, which is somebody wants to make more money, they put up a wall, but they can’t do that without the city approving it because the city’s going to require that there’s a method of egress. That means an escape for the person who’s trapped in a fire in one side. Why? Because they could die. See?\n\nSo, yeah. Illegal apartment.\n\nAlright. But because it’s an illegal apartment, you got told to vacate, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright. Now, are you on a month-to-month at this point?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you get told you have to leave because it’s illegal on what day?\n\nPlaintiff: The 16th is when—\n\nJudge: So you left on the 16th?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, pretty much.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, deflection, minimization"}

You are suing Henry Dorsy the Third for $1,100, the cost of a car that you say you sold to him and let him have without paying you anything, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Just a little story about, I met Mr. Dorsy about two years ago. He was a good personal friend of mine and, um, seems like our whole friendship, now that I look back, it’s one of those friendships that, uh, I was always helping him out. I got him a job at the company I worked for.

You didn’t do even that much?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I made a mistake.\n\nJudge: So now, according to you, you paid him how much?\n\nDefendant: $450.\n\nJudge: What does your receipt say?

It’s not like I’m going to a used car lot or something where he’s going to hand me a receipt.\n\nJudge: So how’s this working for you right now?\n\nDefendant: It’s not working at all.\n\nJudge: Right. So now, instead of rolling your eyes when I ask you why you would pay cash and not get a receipt, now it looks like you made a mistake, right?\n\nDefendant: Oh, I did. I made a mistake for not getting it written.\n\nJudge: Cash shouldn’t leave this hand without a receipt coming into this hand.

Okay so you have a Yellow Cab on the streets of New York City and you wanted to be able to do what?\nPlaintiff: Well I was leasing the cab from him weekends Friday Saturday and Sunday.\nJudge: And is this a cab that you lease out the rest of the week to someone else or you're driving it?\nDefendant: I drive.\nJudge: So had and but you weren't driving it seven days a week?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: All right so he comes up to you with this idea and you're going you're going to pay him how much to rent it?\nPlaintiff: Well I paid him a premium over the going rate for what a Friday Saturday and Sunday shift would be.\nJudge: So I why why?\nPlaintiff: Because uh he had a nice cab and because I only wanted to do so...\nJudge: How much were you paying him?\nPlaintiff: I paid him $500 every weekend.\nJudge: So you agree to pay $500 and you in fact you signed an agreement right?\nPlaintiff: We signed an agreement.\nJudge: Who authored the agreement?\nPlaintiff: I authored the agreement.\nJudge: Can I see the agreement?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Sir okay so that issue is this Clause as part of this agreement Stern agrees to give a check for $1,000 representing a refundable deposit on 396 what's that?\nPlaintiff: The Medallion number 396 medallion.\nJudge: So then what happens?\nPlaintiff: Well what happens is uh I drove for Cliff from I think it was February 10th to July 1st of 2012. I would take the cab home and I would take it on Friday I would garage it rather than park it on the street on Friday and...\nJudge: Okay I know about all that but then what happens the there's an accident tell me about the...\nPlaintiff: Yes what happened was there was a gas station on 187th Street in Broadway...\nJudge: Is that the first accident?\nPlaintiff: Uh that's the first accident that I was responsible for no...\nJudge: Tell me the first accident that happens.\nPlaintiff: The first accident occurred on Friday May the 4th in Williamsburg. I was uh handling a credit card transaction and it wasn't going through and a young man was trying to maneuver around me and he misjudged and he rear ended the car and put a ding in the left bumper. At that point I pulled the car over uh exchanged information with him a policeman showed up and the young man indicated he didn't want to deal with an insurance claim and he said he would be good for covering the damage.\nJudge: How'd that work out?\nPlaintiff: He took care of it.\nJudge: Oh he did wow I didn't expect...\nPlaintiff: I know.\nJudge: That's a first. How much was it?\nPlaintiff: Uh $1,600.\nJudge: And did you get it fixed with $1,600?\nPlaintiff: I did eventually yes.\nJudge: With that $1600 or did you wait for the second accident?\nPlaintiff: I actually waited till the second accident.\nDefendant: That is not true your honor.\nJudge: Which part?\nDefendant: Uh any of it. Uh he didn't get $1,600 from the guy he got $1,500 from him to cover the cost of the accident then the following week he got $600 from him to cover the time he lost getting the bumper fixed only leaving out the small detail that he never got the bumper fixed so basically he leveraged the young man $2,100 under false...\nJudge: How much you get the young man from the young man?\nPlaintiff: 2100 I guess what he said would be 21 yeah.\nJudge: Okay so now there's a second accident which happens on what date?\nPlaintiff: That happened uh on the weekend ending Sunday July 1st I believe. There's a gas station that I used in my neighborhood before I would go garage the car and I was basically hemmed in and in trying to back out and get the car out of the gas station I hit one of the metal extrusions on the gas Island and I put a bump in the right rear bumper of the car.\nJudge: Now at this point had the bumper been fixed from the first accident the left bumper?\nPlaintiff: No it's never been fixed.\nJudge: And so then what happens?\nPlaintiff: What happened was is I called him and let him know that I had put a bump in the bumper and I completed the weekend shift uh the Thursday before my next uh weekend shift Cliff called me up and said that he was going to abgate uh our lease agreement and that he was afraid that he would not be able to uh sustain his insurance.\nJudge: Why did you really want to uh stop the deal with him?\nDefendant: You know he hasn't said very much that's been the truth so far so it's a bit hard for me to remember everything that he's just been telling you. The reason why I did not file with the insurance I'm required by the taxi and limousine commission to report to my broker any accident I have if I don't I can get into serious trouble with the TLC. This is why anytime I've had an accident I let my broker know whether he contacts the insurance or not is his decision if he feels he doesn't have to or it's not necessary or we can avoid it then it's avoided. What he said to me after the second accident was and the first accident the guy paid for it okay so that wasn't that wasn't important on on on the second one uh it didn't happen the last weekend as chip loves to say uh it happened uh a few weeks before then and on a Monday I mean I have to notice that it's not just a little ding as he likes to call it and as he told me on emails on my cheap old cab or whatever it was when he wants to disparage the cab it's a Lexus hybrid and it is in beautiful condition.\nJudge: All right do you have a picture of it?\nDefendant: Not with me.\nJudge: Ma'am do you have pictures?\nDefendant: Yes I do.\nJudge: Oh can I see it. So you ended up paying how much to fix both accidents?\nDefendant: Because it was all mercifully it was the same bumper the shop I went to fix luckily you hadn't fixed the first the bumper had to be changed body work had to be taken out the paint has to be matched up to the body and the bum the whole thing cost me a thousand a little over $1,000 from the body shop.\nJudge: That's a picture of the car before the bumper the two bonds with you hanging all over you who are they?\nPlaintiff: Uh were some friends I made from Australia the lady in the night is...\nJudge: Right is name the lady in the night the lady in The Night Lady of the knife what was it you said that that was?\nPlaintiff: I misspoke a Freudian slip.\nJudge: You meant the lady on the right?\nPlaintiff: I'm afraid so uh they were passengers from Australia where I helped them find a hotel they didn't have an address for.\nJudge: Okay but that illustrates the car before the damage to the right bumper the damage to the...\nPlaintiff: May I address some things that Mr Adler...\nJudge: No because I'm I pretty much have got it now this $1,000 is this a dent in the right quarter panel or no I can't see from here ma'am?\nDefendant: No but I mean do you know was there damage?\nJudge: Oh yes there...\nJudge: Wait there was damage to something other than the bumper?\nDefendant: The quarter panel on both sides both quarter panels were hit and and the bumper yes ma'am.\nJudge: All right now you got all of this fixed for how much?\nDefendant: A little over $1,000.\nJudge: What let me see the receipts of how of what it cost to get it fixed and you did not go through Insurance to get all of it fixed in the end?\nDefendant: No in the end you ended up just paying I told my broker...\nJudge: Yeah you got paid like so much more than you deserve to get paid by that poor young sucker who was desperate not to claim it in his insurance he must have been driving without insurance and didn't want to get in trouble for him to have covered that other accident you get $2,100 and pocket that okay um you know you call that fraud but it's not really fraud because you know he managed to win this poor sucker that that was $2,100 worth of damage when we both know that double that damage was $900 worth of damage so generally speaking are cab drivers good drivers or bad drivers?\nAudience Member 1: Um in my experience I would say they were bad because they're I mean if I need to be somewhere fast they're super aggressive which is helpful but it's kind of scary.\nJudge: Super aggressive which is helpful what do you think?\nAudience Member 2: In my experience yeah they're fine because I just haven't had a bad experience yet so...\nJudge: Okay who's had a smelly experience?\nAudience Member 3: Yeah that's what we've all had.\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom I have to decide one thing and one thing only how much of the bill that you ended up paying for repairing the Lexus should be his responsibility on the accident that was his fault okay because the first one he's completely exonerated of since you collected from somebody else on it four times what it's worth um so I find that to be half $481.50 and therefore I'm going to order you to return to him from this security deposit $519 that's verdict for the plaintiff that's my judgment.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, defelction, guilt tripping, playing the victim, gaslighting"}

What kind of party was this?\n\nPlaintiff: It was our 13th wedding anniversary for my husband and me.\n\nJudge: Okay. Is your husband in the room?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he is.\n\nJudge: All right. Come on, front and center. Why are you leaving her alone here?\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: Oh no, I’m not.\n\nJudge: Tall drink of water. You okay? All right. So, what happens? You guys are having this big party. How many people?\n\nPlaintiff: We had invited 175 people.\n\nJudge: Okay, and how many showed up?\n\nPlaintiff: 142.\n\nJudge: Okay, and were you serving dinner and drinks?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we hired a food truck to cater and then A Sip of Class to provide bartending services.\n\nJudge: And the party was to last from when to when?\n\nPlaintiff: The party was to last from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.\n\nJudge: Do you have a contract with them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have the contract.\n\nJudge: Okay, may I see that?\n\nPlaintiff: Sorry, Rex—I contracted Rex from 8:30 to 11:30.\n\nJudge: Okay, so that’s an issue in the case. 8:30 to what time?\n\nPlaintiff: 11:30.\n\nJudge: 11:30, all right. So tell me what happens the night of the party. By the way, how much were you paying him?\n\nPlaintiff: $5,000.\n\nJudge: And according to this contract, you paid him $5,000, and he does what?\n\nPlaintiff: He was supposed to come with four bartenders and himself and provide all of the alcohol listed on our signed contract for 175 guests.\n\nJudge: Okay. The alcohol—it’s listed in the contract?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. It was supposed to be: S.B. gin, Hennessy, Bacardi rum, 1800 Tequila, Bulleit bourbon, Stella Artois, cups, napkins, fruit, water, juice, soda, ice…\n\nJudge: Cabernet, red wine, white wine, Chardonnay. You didn’t specify any brands for the wines?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: You’re not a wine drinker, are you?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really.\n\nJudge: I know you’re not, or you would have. All right. Okay. So then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He shows up, and the first time that I realized something was wrong, my husband had gone to the bar prior to the party starting and asked for a glass of Bulleit, which is what he drinks—another reason why I was very specific in the contract—and was told that Bulleit was not available.\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: My husband came downstairs to my dressing room to let me know that there was no Bulleit.\n\nPlaintiff: I subsequently came out, and my husband and I spoke with Rex, who explained that the liquor service company he purchases from did not send Bulleit to him, but he offered to go to a local liquor store around where we were to buy a bottle of Bulleit. My assumption was that he was going to buy an appropriate amount for my guests. When he came back, I was told that he purchased one bottle, and my husband got one drink from that Bulleit.\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: When I went back to the bar after that, I was told there was no Bulleit.\n\nPlaintiff: Subsequently, I talked to guests who were not able to get the alcohol they asked for every time they approached the bar. Alcohol ran out before the party was even halfway done.\n\nJudge: What alcohol ran out, and at what time?\n\nPlaintiff: I approached the bar at 9:00 p.m. to ask for a glass of Ciroc, which is what I drink, and there was no Ciroc.\n\nDefendant: I was the bartender that night. I was there watching my staff.\n\nJudge: How many bartenders were there?\n\nDefendant: I brought four bartenders.\n\nJudge: Okay, so really? Was it 9:00? Are you sure?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it was 9:00, because I ended up not drinking at all that night since he didn’t have Ciroc.\n\nJudge: Oh, that’s just criminal on your part. All right, so go on. What else happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a statement from one of the guests.\n\nJudge: Can I see it? Is the guest here?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but my brother’s mother is here.\n\nJudge: Your brother’s mother?\n\nPlaintiff’s Witness: I’m Corliss. I have to agree with her. There wasn’t any Ciroc when I went to the bar.\n\nJudge: What time do you remember it being?\n\nPlaintiff’s Witness: Probably around 9:00.\n\nJudge: All right. Let’s talk to you, Rex. What happened that night?\n\nDefendant: First of all, I’ve been in business for three years. This is my first complaint. Basically, we purchased the liquor, and we guaranteed that alcohol would last the entire night—not one particular brand, but overall alcohol.\n\nJudge: But you shouldn’t be running out of all of them. Did you not have the man’s drink?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am, I did.\n\nJudge: Then what happened?\n\nDefendant: When Mr. went upstairs to check, we were barely unloading. When I came back from grabbing ice, he said it wasn’t up there. So I immediately went to get it.\n\nJudge: How many bottles did you buy?\n\nDefendant: I bought two bottles of Bulleit bourbon.\n\nJudge: And that ran out?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: So two wasn’t enough.\n\nDefendant: The man drank one and a half bottles by himself.\n\nJudge: That’s hard to believe.

{"id": "830", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties are right here. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says the defendant stiffed him on embroidering the defendant's company name on some T-shirts, but the defendant says the guy wrote \"Newark Heart Care\" instead of \"Car Care,\" so he's got to be kidding. It's the case of brokenhearted Leon against heavy debts.\n\nJudge: Okay, Ernest Ricka, you are suing Leon Goretski of Newark Car Care Incorporated. You’re the owner, for $1,618.15 for 90-something t-shirts that he purchased from you and never paid for. Okay, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, first of all, I've been doing work with Newark Car Care for about 20 years. I spoke to Leon, he said come in, and he needed stuff for the staff.\n\nJudge: What is Newark Car Care?\n\nPlaintiff: An auto repair shop.\n\nJudge: How much staff do you have at any given time?\n\nPlaintiff: Fourteen guys.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So, he gave me an order for, I believe, 97 t-shirts for the mechanics in the back, and then he ordered polos for the guys at the counter and some Nike jackets for Leon and the higher-up people. That was delivered in March. I went in and picked up a check, and the check was returned.\n\nJudge: How was it returned? For what?\n\nPlaintiff: Insufficient funds. So then I told Leon, \"I need the money,\" and he gave me another check for $1,639. That check came back. So then I called the bank that he used, and they literally told me, \"This check will never be good.\"\n\nPlaintiff: After going back to him, he gave me a third check. That check also came back as insufficient.\n\nPlaintiff: We went back and forth for weeks. I called him, and he kept saying, \"I know I owe you the money, everything was fine, and I’m going to pay you.\" He said I’d been fair. But it dragged on, so I finally filed with the court.\n\nDefendant: The first part of the story is correct. Everything was fine, about $2,600 worth of merchandise. I was trying to work something out and get a discount on the last $1,600 because when the summer hit, we started putting on the t-shirts and realized the sizing was wrong.\n\nJudge: What do you mean the sizing was wrong?\n\nDefendant: The triple XLs were too tight.\n\nJudge: You’re saying the shirts were too small?\n\nDefendant: Yes, especially for my bigger guys.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t bring any shirts here as proof?\n\nDefendant: No, I left them at the shop.\n\nJudge: How can you be this relaxed about your defense? You didn’t bring a single piece of evidence.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nJudge: Does this guy lose?\n\nJudge: Yes, because he doesn't have proof that there was anything wrong with the shirts.\n\nJudge: Fair point. I’m giving you the last word. Your answer to the complaint says the shirts were mis-sized and the name was misspelled. How many shirts had a misspelling?\n\nDefendant: Four or five.\n\nJudge: Did you bring them?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant: I left them at the shop.\n\nJudge: So you’re telling me you didn’t bring the shirts to prove there was a mistake?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: You stop payment on the check?\n\nDefendant: That’s not true.\n\nJudge: No? You didn’t stop payment on the check? It bounced because you didn’t have money in your account. So why did you say you stopped payment on the check?\n\nDefendant: I told the plaintiff about the mistakes.\n\nJudge: Did he ever tell you anything about mistakes?\n\nPlaintiff: No. Every time I saw him, he was fine with the order.\n\nJudge: You haven’t paid for the Nike jackets either. Weren’t you wearing the jacket when he came in?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and so was everyone else.\n\nJudge: And you told him, \"I’ll give you a credit card in a week,\" then in a day, and you just kept pushing him off?\n\nDefendant: I was working on paying him.\n\nJudge: No, you weren’t. Paying him would mean handing him $200, $300 a week. What you did—stringing him along with three bounced checks—is not working on paying him. There’s no shame in financial struggles, but there is shame in treating him like garbage. That’s what you did.\n\nJudge: You didn’t even bring the shirts you were complaining about. If you had, we could examine them right now. Instead, you’re making vague claims and hoping I believe them.\n\nJudge: Pay the man.

Turns out her onetime friend stole 22 pieces of valuable jewelry from her and refuses to return them. Well, friend or no friend, she wants the value of her stolen jewelry, which is $3,515.26, and she's suing for it.\n\nJudge: Now, this is the defendant, Moren Bennon. She says she and the plaintiff started an online jewelry-selling business, and the plaintiff still owes her money. She's keeping the 22 pieces of jewelry until the plaintiff's debt is paid off—simple as that. The plaintiff has thus far refused to pay her what she's owed, and she's not giving her anything back until she does. She's accused of breaking up a long-time friendship.\n\nJudge: The defendant has brought a countersuit for $3,387—the amount she's owed.\n\nJudge: All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nBailiff: Please raise your right hand.\n\nBailiff: You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nPlaintiff: I do.\n\nDefendant: I do.\n\nBailiff: Thank you. You may be seated.\n\nJudge: Okay, Cecile, doing business as Vintage Button Bling, you are suing Moren Bennon, your former partner, for $3,515.26. You have a counterclaim against her for $3,387.50. The two of you have known each other for 40 years, and here we are. Talk to me. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, first of all, we are not partners. I started the jewelry business 10 years ago. I was having lunch with the defendant and told her that I wanted to start selling online instead of continuing to travel. She expressed interest in repping it, basically.\n\nJudge: So repping it, but you were splitting the profits?\n\nPlaintiff: The gross, not even the profits—50/50. That was my big mistake.\n\nJudge: Okay, that's called a partner. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: That was my big mistake.\n\nJudge: For how long?\n\nPlaintiff: That went on for the last two years.\n\nJudge: All right, now, the first year went well?\n\nPlaintiff: The first year went well.\n\nJudge: What happens the second year?\n\nPlaintiff: The second year, we were not on the same internet site.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it was a problem because we were selling designer buttons made into jewelry. And the designer sent us a cease and desist because you can't sell designer buttons, make them into jewelry, and profit from it.\n\nJudge: Who was the designer who gave you the cease and desist?\n\nPlaintiff: Chanel.\n\nJudge: Oh. And how many times did Chanel ask you to cease and desist?\n\nPlaintiff: Ten.\n\nJudge: Well, you guys both got away with trade infringement and murder.\n\nPlaintiff: (laughs nervously)\n\nJudge: So now—so you both get away with murder until when?\n\nPlaintiff: Until Etsy had had enough of us and then canceled us.\n\nJudge: Etsy does not want to deal with anything unless Chanel gives you permission?\n\nPlaintiff: Of course, because you're not allowed to do what you're doing.\n\nJudge: So you got fired from Etsy. Where did you go after that?\n\nPlaintiff: Shopify.\n\nJudge: And now Shopify—you figured you'd be on the lam with Shopify for a while because it would take Chanel a bit to catch up?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really.\n\nJudge: Who’s the lady who’s with you?\n\nPlaintiff: This is Devin. She assisted me in all aspects of my business.\n\nJudge: All right, so you go to Shopify. How do the sales go at Shopify?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, Shopify is such a totally different thing that you have to build the traffic.\n\nJudge: What do you mean?\n\nDevin: You need an online presence, essentially.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I know. That's actually what you got paid for and got 50% of the profits for—knowing how to create an online presence. But how exactly did you guys create an online presence for your shop?\n\nPlaintiff: They created social media accounts, and they paid for some Facebook ads, but basically, it just wasn’t profitable.\n\nJudge: Exactly. So then who decided it wasn’t profitable, and you should part ways?\n\nPlaintiff: I did.\n\nJudge: What did you tell her?\n\nPlaintiff: I just said I don’t see how I can keep spending the money that I’ve been putting out.\n\nJudge: What money were you putting out?\n\nPlaintiff: The money that I was spending was on her because we were—I’m not the computer expert. So because of the 50/50 partnership, I was willing to invest my time and the money to learn how to do it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so hold on. So you were being paid a salary by her? By the hour, or how?\n\nDefendant: Hourly, yes.\n\nJudge: What was your hourly rate?\n\nDefendant: $25.\n\nJudge: What was the relationship between you two before this? Anything or none?\n\nPlaintiff: We met in an elevator.\n\nJudge: (laughs) Okay. Listen, what is it you tell her? “We’re going to part ways.” How? What do you say?\n\nPlaintiff: It was all done on emails.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you have the emails?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see the emails? Hand them to my bailiff, please.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over emails.)\n\nJudge: So Moren sends you an email at 12:13 on November 27th: “10% of sales till I reach $2,000. I want to retrieve the approximately $2,000 I am underwater to break even.” What $2,000 were you underwater in?\n\nDefendant: What I spent.\n\nJudge: Why would that be appropriate for you to recoup the cost when she doesn’t get to recoup the cost? But anyway, you agree to this?\n\nPlaintiff: I felt coerced.\n\nJudge: How were you coerced? What was the size of the gun that she put to your head?\n\nPlaintiff: There was no gun.\n\nJudge: Right, but there was never a mention of returning it without the 10%.\n\nJudge: So say no and call the police. She has your stolen goods. You knew how to do that later. You did do that later.\n\nJudge: So you end up agreeing that you will give her 10% of future sales?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: We agreed that I was going to pick up the inventory, and before I even got home, there was an email from them saying that they had forgotten to put in the most valuable of the collection.\n\nJudge: (Sighs) Alright, let’s wrap this up.\n\n(The judge goes on to rule in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the jewelry to be returned and denying the defendant’s claim.)\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection playing the victim persuasion"}

Now, the defendant says he agreed to trade in her VW for a Dodge Charger, and the plaintiff changed her mind and wanted her money back. It's the case of Don’t Bug Me.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Ms. Roundtree, you had a 2003 Volkswagen Beetle, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And you had bought it from him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you brought the car back to him, and what was the discussion you and he had about him selling it?\n\nPlaintiff: To sell the car for me.\n\nJudge: And what were you going to do for him?\n\nPlaintiff: He was going to sell the car for me, and I give him a finance fee.\n\nJudge: Now, according to you, the story is very different, correct, sir?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: What do you say happened?\n\nDefendant: Well, she was in an accident. There was a collision accident.\n\nJudge: Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I bumped the car in my yard, and it has a little bumper thing on the back. It wasn't big at all.\n\nJudge: All right. So, she brings a car to you, and according to you, how bad is the damage?\n\nDefendant: The front bumper was cracked, the grille insert was broken. She brought the car in and said she was interested in another vehicle because she didn’t want to drive that one in that condition. I appraised it—\n\nJudge: You just fix the vehicle?\n\nDefendant: I offered to. I have a body and paint shop as well, so I offered to fix it, gave her my estimate based on visual damage. Of course, we need tear-down time to see if there’s anything further, but she wasn’t interested in paying to fix it. She wanted to buy another car. So, we talked about trading the vehicle. She test-drove three different vehicles. She was interested in a Dodge Charger and a red BMW convertible.\n\nJudge: But she didn’t purchase a new vehicle?\n\nDefendant: Did not.\n\nJudge: Now, according to you, was there an actual deal in place where she had been looking at a particular vehicle, a Dodge Charger?\n\nDefendant: Absolutely.\n\nJudge: And what happened with that? When did you first learn that she no longer wanted to buy it?\n\nDefendant: After the vehicle that she traded in was sold to the new customer.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, how much did you sell it for to the new customer?\n\nDefendant: I have the paperwork here, but the sale price was $2,100.\n\nJudge: Can I see the paperwork?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So, does she have a $2,100 credit?\n\nDefendant: Well, as I explained before, the vehicle was damaged when I received it, and I told her that I would pay for the repairs out of pocket as long as we were reimbursed as a company when the vehicle was sold because I can't sell the vehicle in its current condition.\n\nJudge: But then who gets to decide how much the repair is? You do?\n\nDefendant: Well, we have a body and paint shop where we do estimates based on industry standards.\n\nJudge: So, then you ended up taking $1,200 for the repair, and the only credit was $800 or $900?\n\nDefendant: I actually offered to do the repair for $700 because I wanted to give her a $500 discount just because she’s a returning customer.\n\nJudge: So, the car sold for $2,100, and then there’s $700 in the repair. She should have a credit of $1,400, right?\n\nDefendant: That would be accurate, yes.\n\nJudge: Now, is any of this in writing, folks?\n\nDefendant: No, I have nothing except where she signed over the title to me when she purchased both vehicles.\n\nJudge: Why would you sign over the title to him like that? How could you do that and not have something clear in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: What happened was, he said to me, I just want to make it legitimate to the customer, and you will do the final sale. I'm going to call you, and we're going to come together, and you will do the final sale. And I trusted him. He seemed noble.\n\nJudge: Did she fill out any paperwork for the Charger or whatever other car she was looking at?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and I actually took a deposit on it.\n\nJudge: Where is that? Show me the paperwork.\n\nDefendant: I threw it away.\n\nJudge: Completely incompetent. Boneheaded move. You threw it away because the case would be over if you showed it to me, right?\n\nDefendant: I apologize.\n\nJudge: I'm going to do a little rough justice here. You don’t want to do business with him, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Never.\n\nJudge: I’m going to take into account that that $1,400 represents a profit to you, too. So, I’m going to order a reduced amount paid to her so there’s no further contact between the two of you. What I’m going to order you to pay her is $1,000.

{"id": "686", "dialogue": "\n**Judge:** All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff says he was hired by the defendant to do some work around her house, and then she went and stopped payment on his check. But the defendant says the plaintiff was rude to her, didn't wear a mask in her house in the middle of a pandemic, and is owed nothing for his shoddy work. It’s the case of “Mask Up or Pay Up.” Thank you, Douglas.\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** You are welcome. All right, Mr. George, you are suing Ms. Lucy for $785—$390 of it money that you say she owes you and stopped payment on, and the rest of it for pain and suffering and returned check fees. What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** I received a text from her the Friday before Thanksgiving of last year, and it said that she was a friend of a friend who is a very dear friend of mine who lost his wife last year of 61 years. He is in incredible grieving right now, and I will do anything to help this guy. So when I received the text from the defendant, you know, I went into overdrive because she said she was a friend of Putter’s. She doesn’t know Putter well, as it turns out—she’s a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of Putter’s or something, apparently. I don’t know.\n\n**Judge:** All right. But so you agree on $65 an hour to do some handiwork, and it’s an actual hourly fee, correct? Like it’s not by the job, it’s by the hour?\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** Yes. You know, I charge a minimum of two hours to do anything, and then it’s $65 an hour for every hour after.\n\n**Judge:** Right. But it’s by the hour, and she agrees to it. And then you go there, and how many hours of work do you do?\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** Six hours.\n\n**Judge:** All right. So she pays you the $65. She pays you by check the $65 an hour for $390. Does she express any concern while she before she pays you? Is she upset about anything?\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** Nothing. She’s complimentary, she’s friendly. She tells me that she actually doesn’t know my friend, but that she got my number from someone else. And that’s when I’m like, what? You know? But no, she expressed no concern whatsoever. And then it was on Thanksgiving Day that I found out that the check had been stopped.\n\n**Judge:** That’s not a great day to have a stopped check. Right. So do you call her, or what do you do?\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** I texted her. And I believe, and I certainly hope, I’ve been professional this whole time. She sent me the world’s longest text, and when she called me a misogynist, that’s when I stopped reading it. I don’t even know what the rest of the text said. I’ve never read it. I just simply realized that I needed to just go to court and file a small claims case.\n\n**Judge:** Let me hear from you, Ms. Lucy. You paid the guy a check for $390 and then you stopped payment on it. Why?\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** Well, because I realized that he had left a huge mess.\n\n**Judge:** But you realized that the day you were writing out the check. There’s nothing new. That wasn’t a surprise, was it?\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** Well, I was working when he was in the house, and I was going to let it go. I was just going to deal with the mess that he left. That’s why I wrote him the check. But after he left and I finished my work that I was doing at the dining room table, I went in and I saw the electrical sockets that he hadn’t put back. I saw the shelves, I went to the front, and there was a mess in the front. There was a mess in the backyard. He left such a mess. And I thought to myself, no, that’s not right. I’m not going to pay him the full amount.\n\n**Judge:** So the next morning you texted him and said you weren’t going to pay the full amount but would pay half?\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** Yes, because he did half the work.\n\n**Judge:** Right. But see, you weren’t paying him by the job. If you had said, “I’m going to pay you $390 to paint these two rooms,” and then you say, “Well, he only got to one of the rooms,” I understand what you’re saying. But your agreement with him was to pay him by the hour, right?\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And that’s just math. He spent x amount of time doing the work, so you owe him y. That’s it. You just—it’s just math.\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** But $65 an hour is a lot of money. And I thought that for $65 an hour, I would be completely hands-off. I assumed he was a professional handyman.\n\n**Judge:** All he has to do is tell you, “My time is worth $65 an hour.” And then all you have to do is answer my question: Was he there six hours? If those two things are correct, then don’t rehire him. But you don’t get to say, “You should have worked faster.”\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** But I told him not to cash the check, and I told him I was going to write him another check.\n\n**Judge:** Yes, but that’s not up to you. Once you let the guy work there under the agreed-upon terms—which are $65 an hour—and you let six hours pass, six times $65 is what the guy gets.\n\n**Judge:** Verdict for the plaintiff. $395—$390 plus a $5 returned check fee. You don’t get pain and suffering in a contract case.\n\n**Defendant (Lucy):** I don’t think it was fair. He should have completed one job properly before starting another. It is what it is.\n\n**Plaintiff (George):** My comment about her dogs was just an observation. I like women. That’s all.\n\n**Judge:** The bottom line is, if you owe someone money, you pay them.

What was going on?\n\n[Plaintiff]Sure. In April of 2017, I contacted Mr. Tocki—\n\n[Judge]You own a summer home in Florida?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes, I bought the home five years ago. My stepson and his wife and my three grandkids live there. They’ve lived there for two and a half years.\n\n[Judge]And in what city?\n\n[Plaintiff]Sarasota.\n\n[Judge]So you own the home next door to that home?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes, my mother passed away and willed it to me.\n\n[Judge]Is anybody living there now?\n\n[Plaintiff]No, I am trying to retire to be able to live there.\n\n[Judge]Where do you live now?\n\n[Plaintiff]Wisconsin.\n\n[Judge]And you, Mr. Tocki?\n\n[Defendant]Michigan.\n\n[Judge]Okay, so what happened?\n\n[Plaintiff]I contacted Mr. Tocki because my tenant, who is my stepson, showed me that there were a couple of trees on his property that were hanging over the fence. Our entire backyard is fenced in, and the trees were pushing into the fence, causing damage.\n\n[Judge]Not just hanging over, but also growing into the fence?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes.\n\n[Judge]And how did you contact him?\n\n[Plaintiff]By phone.\n\n[Judge]And what did you tell him?\n\n[Plaintiff]I said, \"You've got some trees that are overhanging and causing damage. If we get a bad storm, there's going to be a lot of damage.\"\n\n[Judge]And what did he say?\n\n[Plaintiff]He said he had some problems—his wife was in jail, he had no money—and just ignored it.\n\n[Defendant]That’s not true! I never said my wife was in jail! I had problems at work.\n\n[Judge]Okay, but what is your response to his claim that your tree was the problem?\n\n[Defendant]My fence was not the problem. His fence was already leaning into my trees.\n\n[Judge]Do you have pictures?\n\n[Defendant]Yes, here they are—before, during, and after Hurricane Irma.\n\n[Judge]Let's see both sets of pictures. Mr. Tocki, your pictures even show the fence leaning into your yard. The fence was falling apart.\n\n[Plaintiff]Well, later pictures show how the storm tore it down.\n\n[Judge]Yeah, and a little thing called Irma. So why didn’t you cut the tree down earlier?\n\n[Plaintiff]After I got back to Wisconsin, I wrote him a letter saying I was willing to take care of it, but I never got a response.\n\n[Judge]Here’s the thing: In Florida, you have a right to cut anything over your property, from the ground to the sky. You should have done it yourself.\n\n[Plaintiff]But he promised he would take it down.\n\n[Judge]And then what happened when the hurricane hit?\n\n[Plaintiff]The tree fell, and 30 feet of my fence came down.\n\n[Judge]Mr. Tocki, what did you do?\n\n[Defendant]My brother-in-law went to check the property, and his stepson got aggressive, yelling at him for taking pictures.\n\n[Judge]Was that necessary?\n\n[Defendant]No, I don’t know why he did that.\n\n[Judge]And your stepson trespassed and cut the tree down?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes.\n\n[Judge]Mr. Tocki, you're counter-suing for $5,000 for trespassing?\n\n[Defendant]Yes.\n\n[Judge]Here’s the law: You have a responsibility to cut what is offending your property. That means you can't sue your neighbor for not doing it. And if a hurricane brings a tree down, it's an act of God. Your damage was either due to the storm, or your own negligence in not cutting the tree.\n\n[Plaintiff]But I—\n\n[Judge]No. On your lawsuit—zero. On your counter-suit—zero. Good luck, folks. Maybe one day you’ll be neighbors and get along.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, playing the victim"}

Now, the defendant says the two of them were a thing, and the loot was a gift. It’s the case of ‘The Fix Is In.’\n\n**[Bailiff]**\nAll parties, please raise your right hands.\n\n**[Judge]**\nBriana Pope, you are suing your former friend, Vincent Howard, for $1,933 and some change that you say he owes you for a loan that you made to him previously. What’s going on?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes, um, in October of last year, Vince asked me to borrow money for a transmission.\n\n**[Judge]**\nHow did you two know each other?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nWe met when I first moved to Atlanta.\n\n**[Judge]**\nAnd what was your relationship with him?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nWe were friends at first, we ended up being together, and then...\n\n**[Judge]**\nOkay, and did this happen while you were together?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nOkay, and what happened?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nI gave him—well, he asked me to co-sign—well, not co-sign, but sign for a loan through Care Credit for him to get his transmission fixed on his car.\n\n**[Judge]**\nWhy didn’t he do it himself?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nI’m guessing that his credit wasn’t good.\n\n**[Judge]**\nHow do you get bad credit?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nNot paying bills.\n\n**[Judge]**\nDo you see the connection?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nMhm. Yeah. Not your smartest move, right?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nRight.\n\n**[Judge]**\nOkay. And did you make it clear to him that he had to pay you back?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nAnd what did you tell him?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nI told him that there was no interest on the credit card for six months, so if he pays it back in six months, it won’t accrue interest. But he needs to pay it back because I have other obligations that I wanted to take care of with my credit.\n\n**[Judge]**\nIn fact, you’re trying to clean up your credit, correct?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nYou got rid of all your credit cards?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nSo how does a person who’s trying to clean up their credit, who’s taken the Herculean effort of getting rid of all her credit cards because she knows how important this is, then open up a credit card for a man and hope he pays? Tell me. Tell me. How old are you?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nI’m 28.\n\n**[Judge]**\nYeah, you should know better. That’s like a 16-year-old move, right?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**\nRight.\n\n**[Judge]**\nOkay, what’s going on? How are you addressing this, Mr. Howard?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nShe’s right. She did sign for the financing for the truck, and I agreed to pay her the money back. But she did it because she wanted to do it. I didn’t, you know, I didn’t make—\n\n**[Judge]**\nI’m sorry, did you agree to pay her money back?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI told her I would pay her money back, yeah, but—\n\n**[Judge]**\nThat wasn’t the agreement?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nThat wasn’t the initial agreement.\n\n**[Judge]**\nWhat was the initial agreement?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI asked her to finance the truck, and she did it.\n\n**[Judge]**\nJust for free? Just because you’re so cute and irresistible?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI think so.\n\n**[Judge]**\nReally? You didn’t twist her arm?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nNo.\n\n**[Judge]**\nShe says you were very clear from the beginning that you had to pay it back within six months because that was the only period of time with no interest. You were paying $90 a month, correct?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nWhy were you making payments if it was a gift?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nBecause she asked me to.\n\n**[Judge]**\nSo you’re such a good guy, making monthly payments on something that was supposedly a gift? You started the payments yourself?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**\nWhy would you pay for a gift?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI mean, initially...\n\n**[Judge]**\nThis is sarcasm, you idiot.\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI put $600 down on the truck.\n\n**[Judge]**\nYou’re a liar. You did agree to pay it back. The proof is that every month you were paying the minimum amount. That is not what you do if someone gave you a gift. You’re a loser who never had the money to pay her back.\n\n**[Defendant]**\nShe was complaining every day.\n\n**[Judge]**\nNo, you started paying her because you were supposed to. You’re just a mean, horrible person. Repeat after me: I am a mean, horrible person.\n\n**[Defendant]**\nI’m a great person.\n\n**[Judge]**\nYeah, with really bad credit. Did you know if it’s not paid in full in six months, they charge back interest?\n\n**[Defendant]**\nIt wasn’t my problem.\n\n**[Judge]**\nYeah, it is now. Verdict for the plaintiff, $1,933.35.

What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Back at the beginning of August of last year, 2011, he called me to see if I could call and give him a price on a pool cover.\n\nJudge: How do you two know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: His wife, I believe, works for a good friend of mine. So actually, in the beginning of 2011, I went over to his house and helped him get the pool clear because it was dirty.\n\nJudge: Helped him get it clear because he called you to hire you to do that originally?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, they called to see if I could give them some help. So I did that for nothing. I just went over to help him. It took about 15-20 minutes.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Got the pool clear for him. Then in August, he called. He wanted a safety cover for his pool, which has the springs on it so kids can walk on it, in case anything happens. A safety cover. I measured the pool. I called him up. I went back to the house, measured it again. I gave him a quote on 3x3 spacing, which is narrower straps. But his pool, I told him he saves a couple hundred if he makes it 5x5 spacing.\n\nJudge: What's 5x5 spacing?\n\nPlaintiff: Between the straps on the safety cover. They put them every 3 feet or every 5 feet, depending on which cover you get. If he went 5x5, it would be cheaper. So he said okay, get me one. I gave him the price of the cover. He said, \"Go ahead and order.\"\n\nJudge: What was the price of the cover?\n\nPlaintiff: The price was $1,748.\n\nJudge: What was so custom about this pool? Did it have an odd shape?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it’s just a rectangle with the steps coming off the shallow end.\n\nJudge: So the custom pool cover is just a rectangle?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, they're all custom because the steps aren't exactly most steps. Like, say, 8 feet. His was 3 feet by 4 feet, which is an off-size step.\n\nJudge: But what does the cover have to do with the steps? Aren’t you covering the whole top?\n\nPlaintiff: No, you can’t. It’s got to be cut into a rectangle with an extra square coming off for the stairs because that’s how his pool is shaped.\n\nJudge: You ran that by him verbally? Nothing in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to his house twice and talked to him.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t have him sign a proposal?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: So he tells you, \"Sure, go ahead.\"\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then where do you go to have this made?\n\nPlaintiff: I go to a wholesaler, and they send it out to a company that makes them.\n\nJudge: Okay. When was the first inkling you got that there was going to be a problem?\n\nPlaintiff: September 15th. He called and spoke to my wife. He wanted to know when the cover was coming in.\n\nJudge: Okay. Tell me about the phone call.\n\nPlaintiff’s Wife: He asked when the cover would come in. It had not come in yet, so I told him that it should be in shortly, and as soon as it arrived, I would give him a call.\n\nPlaintiff: Two days later, he calls back and says he doesn’t want it anymore.\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He left a message saying, \"I don’t need that cover anymore. Somebody gave me one.\"\n\nJudge: What’s going on, Mr. Failen?\n\nDefendant: I met him in June through a friend. I called him a few times in July about a pool cover but didn't hear from him until the end of August. When I finally spoke to him, he said he could come over and measure the pool. I told him, \"Okay.\"\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nDefendant: He calls me a week later, tells me about the price difference. I said, \"Okay, I’ll take the one with the warranty.\"\n\nJudge: So you agreed to it?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but I kept looking around because I wasn’t sure if he’d follow through.\n\nJudge: But you told him to go ahead?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then you found a cheaper one?\n\nDefendant: Yes, so I called him and left a message saying I didn’t need it anymore.\n\nJudge: That’s not how custom orders work. You don’t get to just cancel them when you find a better deal. I find in favor of the Plaintiff for $1,396.41.\n\nJudge: The pool cover belongs to him.

I tried to get him to come back down there and take care of his court case—explained to him that they were just misdemeanors, and… and he just wouldn’t do it.\n\nJudge: Does that sound like your brother to you?\n\nDefendant: Kind of.\n\nJudge: So why did you co-sign a bond for him?\n\nDefendant: Um, because he was trying to change his life and—\n\nJudge: Is he still with the woman who pressed the charges against him?\n\nDefendant: Well, it was actually my spouse who pressed the charges on him. They got into an argument.\n\nJudge: Your spouse?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Oh. Maybe that’s why you’re calling a bondsman. So are you still with your spouse?\n\nDefendant: At the time, we did separate for, um, like eight months. But then, yeah, we ended up getting back together.\n\nJudge: That’s weird. And your spouse won’t drop the charges, or the DA won’t allow your spouse to drop the charges?\n\nDefendant: They won’t allow him to drop the charges.\n\nJudge: Right. Because you’d love for him to drop the charges so that he would then stop pursuing you.\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: So what happens? He doesn’t show up for court, and, uh, court says, “Gimme, gimme.”\n\nPlaintiff: Well, he actually was going for a couple of court dates, then he—\n\nJudge: But you gotta go for all of them, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: Then he didn’t show. So I got the bond forfeiture—which is the yellow piece of paper you have there—saying I have five months to have him either get another—\n\nJudge: Five months? 150 days?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: You have three options: either he files a motion to get another court date, which didn’t happen; turn himself in and get another court date, which didn’t happen; or I can get him and turn him back in, or he gets picked up by the cops, which didn’t happen either because he’s in Ohio.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: So after the five months, I had to pay the bond forfeiture.\n\nJudge: So you paid it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: May I see that you paid it?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s that paper, the one you have.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what do you think is going to happen here, and why do you think you shouldn’t have to pay him even though you promised you would if this happened? This is exactly—this is your one job in this contract you signed. Your job is to pay $2,000 if your brother doesn’t show up. That’s the only job you have. And you feel you shouldn’t have to pay it—why?\n\nDefendant: Because I provided him with the whereabouts of my brother, and he never—he showed up at my house one night and stated that he had a warrant to search my house.\n\nJudge: He said he had a warrant to search your house?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: I have no idea, but that sounds kind of fishy. In any event, it doesn’t matter, because the guy’s in Ohio, and you think that he should spend $3,000 or $4,000 going to Ohio instead of getting $2,000 from you and calling it a day.\n\nDefendant: [Silent]\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection , evasion,Playing the Victim,emotional appeal"}
{"id": "947", "dialogue": "Judge:\nOkay, Electrical Control Systems, represented here by Mr. Prasad. You're the owner, yes?\n\nPlaintiff (Cuk Prad):\nYes, I was the owner.\n\nJudge:\nThe business is no longer in business?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nYou are suing Edward Catalinus, your former landlord of 20 years, for $3,000, a statutory maximum that you say you are out because he won't return your $1,500 security deposit, and you want interest on it, plus the value of all the things that you left behind. Is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, that’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAs stated before, I was a good tenant. I paid my rent on time every month for 20 years.\n\nJudge:\n20 years. Okay, what kind of business did you have?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA computer repair business mostly.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, the store was just accommodating, doing repairs for the locals.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, that's correct. I was there for 20 years, paying almost $375,000 during that period of time for rent and property tax adjustments.\n\nJudge:\nGo on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThen it was time to go.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you break down your business?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, no, I mean, the lease ended, and I didn’t need the space anymore.\n\nJudge:\nSo you informed him in January that when the lease is over in May, it's over, and that you no longer need the space?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect. And everything was fine until it wasn’t.\n\nJudge:\nWhen was the first inkling you had that you were going to have a problem?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, one month passed, so I contacted him, and he said, “Well, you know, he didn’t forget me, and he would take care of it.\" Now three months passed, and I received an email saying that I have no security deposit for you because he had to spend an amount that was more than what the worth of the security deposit was.\n\nJudge:\nThe security deposit was $1,500?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so once you got that response from him, what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was angry, right, because I felt that I had left the place in good condition, and I shouldn’t have to fund him making it spiffier for the next guy.\n\nJudge:\nAnd therefore, you are suing for the $1,500 security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect, and I want compound interest on it for those years.\n\nJudge:\nWhere did you get the idea that you could sue for interest on a business lease?\n\nPlaintiff:\nFrom my attorney.\n\nJudge:\nReally? That’s inaccurate. Time for a new attorney.\n\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus):\nAll right, Mr. Catalinus, what’s going on?\n\nDefendant:\nHe’s a good tenant, paid on time for 20 years. A 20-year relationship. We have this issue over $1,500.\n\nJudge:\nYou have this problem.\n\nDefendant:\nWell, we probably could have eliminated it. In one of my emails, I said, “Let’s sit down and talk about it, and I’ll go step-by-step so we could eliminate this.”\n\nJudge:\nHow were you planning to eliminate this?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, this was a security interest on a commercial lease. You don’t have to give interest on a security deposit. I looked up the statute, and it said only on residential, not commercial. I would have gone step-by-step explaining this.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened?\n\nDefendant:\nMr. Prasad was leaving in early April, and his lease expired at the end of May. I called him and told him I wanted to do a walkthrough with him to make sure everything was in accordance with the lease surrender.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant:\nI went in with a contractor who had done a lot of work for me in that building, and we went through it with Mr. Prasad. We started upstairs, and there were two panels of sheetrock missing. Mr. Prasad said he did that because he removed the panels to get more heat and cooling upstairs. So we had to pay $275 to replace the sheetrock panels.\n\nJudge:\nYou have a receipt for that?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat else was wrong?\n\nDefendant:\nApparently, Mr. Prasad had a client or a company give him some lighting, which he put in the store. There were nice fixtures in the front room, but in the back room, we had a hodgepodge of ceiling lights. One was made for a drop ceiling and was sticking down from the ceiling with exposed wires. Two other light fixtures had round circular fluorescent lights, one of which was held up by a piece of wire.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have pictures of this?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, because I told him I was going to have to take them out, or he had to do it.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you just bring the lights back to the way they were?\n\nDefendant:\nThose fixtures aren’t made anymore, and the ones that were there were 20 years old.\n\nJudge:\nSo why didn’t you just save the ones you took down?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause the fixtures that were there were already 20 years old. They don’t make those fixtures anymore.\n\nJudge:\nBut you could have put in new recess lighting?\n\nDefendant:\nThey were never wired to code. The building was never wired to code. Do you have evidence that it wasn’t wired to code when you were there?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, but I can show you one of the light fixtures that were there.\n\nJudge:\nA picture of a light fixture is not going to tell me that the building wasn’t wired to code. What about the smoke alarm rewiring?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, the plaintiff wired the smoke alarm into the building. When he left, he took it out, and that caused problems.\n\nJudge:\nYou can’t remove something like that when it’s part of the building.\n\nDefendant:\nIt was part of the building, and it caused issues. The monitoring system needed to be replaced because wires were cut and pieces were missing.\n\nJudge:\nI agree with you on that. The alarm system became part of the building and needed to be maintained. So what happened when he left?\n\nDefendant:\nWhen he left, the alarm system was damaged, and we had to replace it. The new tenant had to deal with it.\n\nJudge:\nSo you're keeping the security deposit because of these repairs?\n\nDefendant:\nYes. And because of the changes he made to the lighting and other fixtures.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Based on what I’ve heard, I find that the $1,500 security deposit has been used up in bringing the place back to code, and since this is a commercial lease, it doesn’t require compound interest. Therefore, my verdict in this case is for the defendant.\n\nDefendant:\nThank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nAll right, the plaintiff comes out with nothing.\n\nPlaintiff (Cuk Prad):\nI think justice is not served. I don’t understand why I have to pay for an alarm system I own, and I have to pay to repair it, even though I left it in good condition.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you sit down with him to go over everything step by step?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe tried, but he wasn’t interested. After 20 years, I thought he’d be reasonable.\n\nJudge:\nIf he would have read the lease in the beginning, none of this would have happened.\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight. If he would have sat down and gone over everything with me, it could have been worked out.\n\nJudge:\nHow come you couldn’t get him to sit down and go over everything with you?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI guess he didn’t have the time.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s a fixture and what’s not a fixture? In most states, it comes down to intent. Was it the intent of both parties to make something part of the building when the tenant leaves?   Judge: What happened with the smoke alarm rewiring?\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus): Because the plaintiff wired the smoke alarm to the building so tightly into the building, can the plaintiff remove the smoke alarm when the plaintiff leaves?\nPlaintiff (Cuk Prad): What do you think?\nJudge: If it affects the safety of the rest of the tenants in the building, then no. But if it doesn’t…\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus): Well, it clearly does. That’s what a smoke alarm is for.\nJudge: But if it's in their—if it’s in their own apartment?\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus): Well no, it’s a commercial space.\nJudge: So, at a point, does it become a fixture in the building, part of the building?\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus): I would think so, yes.\nJudge: So tough luck. I mean, you put it in and you can use it for as long as you're there, but when you leave, you can't remove it. Right? That seems reasonable to me. Going inside the courtroom, there was no smoke alarm in the building. There were smoke detectors in the building, but at some later date, the town required a central monitoring system with a dial-up in case of a fire. He did put that in, along with a burglar alarm. But after the new tenant moved in, she went to hook up the monitoring system with a company, and they came in and said it had to be replaced because there was not functioning. Wires were cut, pieces were missing.\nJudge: So then why would you be entitled to keep anything more than what it takes to remove it and put one in for your new tenant or tell your tenant to put her on?\nDefendant (Edward Catalinus): Well, because I looked at it as an addition to the building. He had to leave when he—and when he left, wires were cut, pieces were missing, and it shorted out the panel and it had to be replaced.\nJudge: You have a surrender clause, which is typical in a lease, that says that you'll surrender the premises together with any alterations, additions, and improvements, including all plumbing fixtures and other similar installations which may have been made, except movable furniture, movable trade fixtures, carpeting, cabinetry, lighting fixtures purchased at the sole expense of the tenant.\nJudge: Alright. I kind of agree with you. Once you make the alarm part of the place, it’s part of the place, and it needs to be in working order.\nJudge: Based on what I have heard, I find that well over the $1,500 security deposit has been taken up with bringing the place back up to code. And this commercial lease doesn’t require compound interest on the security deposit. Therefore, my verdict in this case is for the defendant.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Persuasion Emotional Appeal"}

And I asked her what had happened, and she said that he was complaining since he got home from the hospital that there was no toilet paper in the house.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And I feel like that shouldn’t be her responsibility.\n\nJudge: He was in the hospital.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Yes, he just had a heart attack.

That’s what you told him was wrong?\n\n**Defendant:** No. What I told him was the water and the ice.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So I said, \"Okay.\"\n\n**Judge:** So then you go over there. Is that accurate, that that’s what she told you was wrong?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No. What she told me was the water and the ice. So I said, \"I’ll check that out.\" I found the problem and I repaired it.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, and do you have a receipt for the parts?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I do.\n\n**Judge:** How much did the parts cost you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $80.\n\n**Judge:** Well, actually?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was $90, including labor.\n\n**Judge:** $90 for parts. And then how much for labor?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I went down to $90.\n\n**Judge:** So, the total was how much?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $180.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So, you go over there and fix the issue, and then what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** When I was repairing the appliance, she left. Her daughter was at the house, and I didn’t really like that, but okay.\n\n**Judge:** How old was the daughter?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t know. How old is your daughter?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t know how old.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** When I was done, she came back, and I told her I would return at 1:00 to pick up the money. Then she said to me that I had broken her fridge because the temperatures weren’t right. But the problem was there was so much water coming down from the top, probably causing the issue.\n\n**Judge:** Let me hear from you. What is your version of why you’re not paying him?\n\n**Defendant:** Everything was wrong.\n\n**Judge:** No, no. You can’t just say, \"It stopped working.\" You have to explain what went wrong specifically.\n\n**Defendant:** I checked it as soon as he left, and nothing was working. It wasn’t freezing, and the water wasn’t coming out cold. The refrigerator wasn’t working. It was broken.\n\n**Judge:** But you just told me earlier that it wasn’t cold enough. That’s different than saying nothing was working.\n\n**Defendant:** No, nothing was working, it wasn’t cooling at all.\n\n**Judge:** And you called him?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I called him and said, \"Come and take it back.\" I decided I’m getting a new refrigerator. I wasn’t going to pay that much money for something that’s not working.\n\n**Judge:** Did you allow him to come and take the part back?\n\n**Defendant:** I told him he could come and get it, but I was very upset. When PC Richard came to bring the new refrigerator, they took the old one out.\n\n**Judge:** But you have to understand, Ms. Batista, that even if what you're saying is correct—that the refrigerator wasn’t working well after the repair—you still have to pay something. He spent money on parts and labor. You have to pay something for the work that was done.\n\n**Defendant:** But I have proof! I didn’t want to ruin his marriage, but he texted me, and he asked me to pay with sex. I have proof!\n\n**Judge:** Okay, okay, sweetheart, I don’t need to hear that.\n\n**Judge:** All right. I do know, I do know. I am going to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff $130. That is my verdict. Good luck.\n\n**Defendant:** Thank you.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, I don’t need to come over here for $270, to be honest with you. I’ve got my own business. It only hurts.\n\n**Judge:** So I am going to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff $130. That’s my verdict. Good luck.\n\n**Courtroom Bailiff:** The plaintiff will receive $130.\n\n[END OF TRANSCRIPT]\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection , exxageration, emotional appeal, minimization, "}

Let against have you sworn.\n\nBAILIFF: Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJUDGE: Narus Herring?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: You are suing Michael Simmons for $5,000 in damages that you sustained as a result of him breaching a contract to rent out his venue to you. Tell me how this happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I used to be in his club in 2009.\n\nJUDGE: What kind of club?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Motorcycle club.\n\nJUDGE: Okay. What club is that?\n\nPLAINTIFF: The Lower Nine Riders.\n\nJUDGE: How many members are in the Lower Nine Riders?\n\nPLAINTIFF: We got 12 members at the moment.\n\nJUDGE: How long were you in that club?\n\nPLAINTIFF: A year and a half. I left the club due to another venue that we had.\n\nJUDGE: What do you mean by another venue?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I helped them find a venue for their clubhouse when they were giving a party before I left. Things went bad that night—real bad—where his wife came after me very disrespectfully. About a week into that, he didn’t come and talk to me as a man. Instead, he came a week later and said he was going to take my vest or center patch because I was burning out. I said, “Yo, you don’t got to lie to me, man. Take your whole vest.”\n\nJUDGE: He was going to take your center patch for burning out your tire?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah. I paid $125 for that tire, and he was telling me not to burn out. So, I just gave him the whole vest.\n\nJUDGE: So, suffice it to say, you gave him the vest and broke away from his club?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Right. He should have just come to me like a man, said, “Why did you talk to my wife like that?” Instead, he tried to put it on me burning out the tire, which was never the case. Anyway, long story short, we made up.\n\nJUDGE: You joined another club?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Right. We made up, became friends again. This was two years later. We had a club meeting, and I told them about having a Halloween party, a Monster Ball.\n\nJUDGE: You wanted to have it at his club?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah. We don’t have a clubhouse. They have a house.\n\nJUDGE: Did you sign anything?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No. I came back in a couple of days with the flyer and showed it to him.\n\nJUDGE: Why didn’t you secure the place first? Did you put a deposit?\n\nPLAINTIFF: His word was our word.\n\nJUDGE: Tell me about the club. Where is it?\n\nDEFENDANT: It’s located in Rochester, New York.\n\nJUDGE: What kind of place is it? Warehouse district? Residential area?\n\nDEFENDANT: Warehouse district.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have a liquor license?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: So, people just bring what they bring and share?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: That’s what’s supposed to happen?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: And this is only used as a clubhouse for motorcycle clubs?\n\nDEFENDANT: Correct.\n\nJUDGE: So, what happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I decided to have the Monster Ball and talked to him about it. I gave him $50 when I got the flyers done. I visited every other weekend and partied with them. I also put up flyers to let people know about the event.\n\nJUDGE: Flyers? It sounds like you’re inviting more than just people in your club or people you know. Invitations are for people you know. Flyers attract strangers.\n\nPLAINTIFF: That was the first thing discussed. This had nothing to do with my club. This was all on me. He was in agreement with this.\n\nJUDGE: How much were you going to pay him?\n\nPLAINTIFF: $100.\n\nJUDGE: Why would he allow strangers on his site for just $100? Liability issues, injuries—why take that risk?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He was taking the liquor sales. I was taking the door money.\n\nJUDGE: You’re taking the door, he’s taking the liquor?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Right.\n\nJUDGE: How many people did you expect?\n\nPLAINTIFF: At least a thousand.\n\nJUDGE: Have you ever thrown a party with that many people?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, multiple times. This is what I do.\n\nJUDGE: When did you first learn something had gone wrong?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Four days before the party, he told me the police shut him down. He refused to give my money back and just left.\n\nJUDGE: What money did you expect back?\n\nPLAINTIFF: At least my deposit. I spent a lot on decorations, including a six-foot-high ghost that was supposed to hang inside. I even brought my niece to help decorate.\n\nDEFENDANT: We only talked about the party. No deposit was made, no contract was signed.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have a receipt for the $100?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No, but I paid him $50 on two separate occasions.\n\nDEFENDANT: That’s not true. If it were only $100, I would have returned it, but no money was exchanged.\n\nJUDGE: The police gang unit visited you?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes. They said I either cancel the party or they shut me down.\n\nJUDGE: You’re saying he spread the word about the party?\n\nDEFENDANT: He posted flyers all over downtown, including the bus station.\n\nPLAINTIFF: No, I only put them up in front of local places.\n\nJUDGE: So, what happened to the party?\n\nPLAINTIFF: It was moved elsewhere, but not to my house. I was at the venue that night waiting to see if they’d open the doors.\n\nJUDGE: You already knew the party was canceled. Why were you there?\n\nPLAINTIFF: To see if they were playing games with me.\n\nJUDGE: Here’s what I think happened. You both knew this was a risk. You knew the club didn’t have a liquor license. You both thought you could fly under the radar. When the police shut it down, you lost your investment, but that was a risk you took. However, I do believe the $100 was paid, so I am awarding the plaintiff $100.

{"id": "377", "dialogue": "**[Courtroom Transcript]**\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to *The People's Court.* Next case on the docket: The plaintiff brought his DVD and VHS player to the defendant for repair, and he says the defendant broke it. But the defendant says the thing was worth ten bucks, and he did his job. It’s the G of old school rules. Okay, Mr. Beevans, you are suing High-Tech Service Center Corporation. Your name is Connell Brooks?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s correct.\n\n**Judge:** And you have authority from the owner to be here?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s correct.\n\n**Judge:** All right. You are suing for $1,000: $55 for aggravation and $495 for a DVD/VHS machine, which they were unable to repair and, in fact, broke further, according to you. So tell me what’s going on here.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor. I have a friend of mine who told me he’s very good and very honest. So I gave him my DVD player and recorder. He charged me $70 originally, but the kid gave back the $70 thinking that it’s fixed and everything is fine.\n\n**Judge:** What kid?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Andy. He does a little odd jobs. I’m a disabled vet, so sometimes he helps me out.\n\n**Judge:** What branch of the service?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Air Force.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Thank you for your service.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Thank you.\n\n**Judge:** So, Andy is a fellow who helps you out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So you sent him down to get it fixed, and Andy pays them, thinking it’s fixed when he goes to pick it up. But in fact, when you bring it back home—this is a DVD player and recorder combo?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, a DVD on one part and a VHS on the other part.\n\n**Judge:** So you can make recordings and copies?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So he brings it back, and it’s not fixed?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That’s right. He didn’t check it. He took the guy’s word that everything was fine. So he had to bring it back again from my apartment.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And to go have it fixed. He goes there, and he said he fixed it the second time?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** So, Andy tells you they say it’s fixed now. When he brought it back to you the first time, did you think you had fixed it?\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah, we did actually fix it.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And then it’s brought back to you how much later?\n\n**Defendant:** I’m not exactly sure, but he brought it back a couple of days later, saying it’s not working.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** I think he had a complaint with the remote not working.\n\n**Judge:** Just the remote wasn’t working or the unit itself wasn’t working?\n\n**Defendant:** The unit was working, but the remote was not working.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have your paperwork from this? Because that’s not their testimony. It’s not his testimony.\n\n**Defendant:** Okay.\n\n**Judge:** So you only did one receipt for this on 10/1, but it was brought back. Where’s the receipt for it being brought back?\n\n**Defendant:** Well, we used the same receipt. We refunded the money back. We didn’t want to deal with the issue.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So you charged him 65—what does it say? “Replaced complete VCR…” What does that say?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s “VHS assembly.”\n\n**Judge:** That word is “assembly”?\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah, I’m sure.\n\n**Judge:** Wow. Is that your handwriting?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s not my handwriting.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So you see “had not working.” How did you guys fix it the first time, do you think?\n\n**Defendant:** We replaced the part that plays the videotape, not the whole thing, just the VCR part.\n\n**Judge:** Now, according to him, when he sent it in, it was just the VCR part that wasn’t working. But now, you say that when it comes back, the DVD part wasn’t working?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, and the recorder doesn’t work. Nothing works.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So they bring it back to you, and what do you guys do?\n\n**Defendant:** Andy brings it back.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah.\n\n**Defendant:** We said, “It’s not worth it. Just get another one.” We didn’t want to deal with the issue. We even offered him another one, a replacement that actually worked, but he refused it.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. How old is this unit?\n\n**Plaintiff:** About six years old. But they never offered me another set. They never offered anything.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. But they returned your money, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** They gave me the money back because I trusted them.\n\n**Judge:** No, they gave you the money back because they couldn’t fix it. What else do you want? You want them to buy you a new machine?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, they broke the most important thing, which was the recorder on the DVD.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have the unit here?\n\n**Plaintiff:** They took it. They never finished it.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have the unit?\n\n**Defendant:** No, we returned it to him.\n\n**Judge:** No, you don’t. You have it.\n\n**Defendant:** We don’t have it.\n\n**Judge:** Hold on. Yes, you do.\n\n**Plaintiff:** You never gave me back that unit.\n\n**Judge:** Where’s Andy? Can we call him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n(Phone call with Andy)\n\n**Judge:** Andy, where’s the set?\n\n**Andy:** I have the set, but it doesn’t work.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, that explains our problem. Does the DVD part work at all?\n\n**Andy:** No. Originally, it was working, but when they messed with it, they broke it.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Andy. We’re going to hang up now.\n\n(End of call)\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So, I am going to order the company to pay the plaintiff—not what he’s asking, so he won’t be happy—but some damages based on the DVD part, which no longer works. That’s $50. Verdict for the plaintiff.\n\n**Plaintiff:** What about the aggravation?\n\n**Judge:** There’s no money for aggravation.\n\n**Defendant:** This is crazy. This was an old piece of equipment. We tried to be reasonable.\n\n**Judge:** Congratulations, Mr. Beevans, you’re getting $50.\n\n**Plaintiff:** That’s it? I had to pay for my friend to take it back and forth.\n\n**Judge:** You can’t get money for aggravation. That’s it.\n\n(End of Case)\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection"}

Okay, Brenda Hill, you are suing Vanel Loyal and Lois Nelson, yes?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: For $914 that you say you are out as a result of them pulling the plug on a skit that you were going to perform. Okay, explain to me what's going on here.\n\nPlaintiff: Each year we have a fundraiser, and we provide funds for kids that are coming out of high school and wanting to go to college.\n\nJudge: So this fundraiser raises funds for college for the kids?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And I'm here about a breach of an agreement. Okay, all right. Who’s we? Who puts this fundraiser together? I think you folks don’t want me to use the name of the organization. That’s fine, I’ll respect that. But just tell me what kind of organization this is. Who’s we?\n\nPlaintiff: A fraternal organization.\n\nJudge: All right.

I was five minutes away from the restaurant.\n\nJudge: So this fundraiser is taking place at a restaurant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay.

She sent your guests away?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, because they were there to take part in it.\n\nJudge: Right, but your guests decided to leave because it was canceled. She didn’t say, \"You got to get out of here,\" did she?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever ask her why the skit was canceled? I’m not understanding the role the skit has in the fundraiser.

What’s going on?\n\nDefendant (Vanel Loyal): As I said before, this is a fraternal organization, and it has two major fundraisers a year. This is one of them. Within this one fraternal organization, there are 133 smaller suborganizations, and each one voluntarily chooses to get together to put on a skit to compete to win.\n\nJudge: Is that every year, or just this year?\n\nDefendant (Vanel Loyal): It’s been for the last two years since my administration.\n\nJudge: And what’s your role in this organization?\n\nDefendant (Vanel Loyal): I’m over the organization for the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nJudge: So you’re the Big Kahuna.

{"id": "561", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Gary Spalding. He says he's a Native American who believes it's his duty to protect Mother Earth. For the past several years, he's had problems with ATVs and motorcycles destroying the land behind his house. The defendant is one of those people who recklessly tears up the land, destroying its natural beauty. He confronted the defendant, who's his neighbor, by the way, and she falsely claimed he threatened her with a gun, causing him excessive legal fees upon his arrest. He is suing for the $5,000 he had to pay for a lawyer.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Crystal Copcheck. She says she was walking in the woods with a friend one day when they were approached by the plaintiff, who was in a very agitated state, to say the least. He was ranting and raving and had either a stick or a rifle in his hand. She called the cops. They took over from there, and any trouble the plaintiff finds himself in is his own doing, not hers. So how does she owe? She's accused of dancing with the wolves.\n\nJudge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff is a Native American who says he is here to protect the Earth and believes the defendant is an earthly enemy. When he confronted her, she falsely accused him of threatening her with a gun. The defendant says that's exactly what he did. It's the days of \"Stop or I'll mulch.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Gary Spalding, you are suing Crystal Copcheck for $5,000. You say your damages actually exceed that in legal fees that you were forced to expend in order to represent yourself after, according to you, she falsely accused you of having a weapon. Tell me what happened on February 1st this year.\n\nPlaintiff: I was sitting in my house around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and I heard a motocross in the forest behind my house, which is approximately 400 feet from my back door. So as I have done many times before, I grabbed my walking stick, my cell phone, and went down to the river to call the D—\n\nJudge: What's the D?\n\nPlaintiff: The Department of Environmental Protection. To let them know that motocross were trespassing in the State Forest.\n\nJudge: What kind of motor vehicles?\n\nPlaintiff: Dirt bikes, ATVs.\n\nJudge: This isn't on your property?\n\nPlaintiff: It's on Connecticut land.\n\nJudge: Say it again?\n\nPlaintiff: State Forest land that abuts my property.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So I—\n\nJudge: Show me. Come on over to this chart and tell me if that'll help you describe this here.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, this is my house here. It's approximately 300 feet from this—the river here. This is the state forest land right here. I was standing on this side of the river. They were approximately on this side of the river here. They stopped and saw me. They know who I am. They know what I do.\n\nJudge: How do they know who you are?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I've called the police department on them many times because they don't carry tags, they're loud, they're doing wheelies.\n\nJudge: The reason it's bothering you is because they're loud and doing wheelies and tricks?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: After I called, I immediately went back to my house, and three of them came up. Miss Crystal—whatever her last name is—she came up with two other friends. They walked past my house and said, \"We weren’t doing anything.\" And I said, \"You're not supposed to be down here with a motorbike.\" That's all I said to them.\n\nJudge: Did you see her on a motorbike?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it was just another friend of hers. But he’s not in the statement or writing a statement against me because the police department knows who he is and that he has a history with them for riding his motorcycle in places he's not supposed to be.\n\nJudge: All right. So she comes by with two other friends and says, \"We didn’t do anything wrong.\" And you say?\n\nPlaintiff: \"You're not supposed to be there.\"\n\nJudge: Then what?\n\nPlaintiff: They went to the house, and I just waited. The next thing you know, the police come to my house.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: The first thing out of the police officer’s mouth was, \"Where’s the pistol?\" I said, \"There is no pistol. There’s no weapon.\"\n\nJudge: What happened then?\n\nPlaintiff: They searched the house, didn’t find any evidence at all of a weapon. Then they went back to their house and came back and said, \"If they’re going to file a statement against you, you’re under arrest.\"\n\nJudge: Let me talk to you now, Crystal. What happened?\n\nDefendant: It was really nice that day, mild weather, so we wanted to go for a walk.\n\nJudge: How old are you?\n\nDefendant: I’m 19.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: We went down across the river to the campground property.\n\nJudge: And who's riding the dirt bike?\n\nDefendant: A friend of a friend.\n\nJudge: All right. So he comes out and does what?\n\nDefendant: He started yelling at us, saying we have to get off the property, that we're not allowed to be down there, and that he’s going to call the cops because of the dirt bikes.\n\nJudge: Then what happens?\n\nDefendant: We went back to my house, and an hour or two later, someone from the DEP came to talk to us.\n\nJudge: But what about the gun allegation?\n\nDefendant: Something looked like a walking stick in the shape of a rifle. It looked really odd and scary.\n\nJudge: Is that what you told the police?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have your statement?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Read it.\n\nDefendant: \"I, Crystal Capcheck, was down at the brook with my friends walking around. We crossed the river where we saw fallen trees and sticks. Gary appeared across the river, yelling at us. He was holding a walking stick in his left hand and a black pistol in his right hand.\"\n\nJudge: You specifically said a black pistol?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\n[The judge continues questioning both parties, ultimately ruling in favor of the defendant.]\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant. I wish all of you good luck.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m sorry she didn’t see it my way, but I understand.\n\nDefendant: I was really scared.

{"id": "817", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Mr. Plav, you are suing Mrs. Cernic for $623.41, that you say she owes you for different jobs that you did for her husband. According to you, her husband never paid. Now, your husband is deceased, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: How long ago?\n\nPlaintiff: 2010, 2011, January 2010.\n\nJudge: Okay, so about a year and a half ago?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: I’ll keep my voice up. Alright, so what’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: In July of 2010, Mr. Cernic contacted me that his van could not be inspected for pollution because the odometer did not work. It was not unusual that he called me, because over the 25 years that I've known him, without exaggeration, I’ve done over 100 jobs for him in that time. I said, \"Bring it over, and I’ll see what I can do with it.\" Well, according to you, you were good friends with him?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nPlaintiff: I told him to bring the van over, and I would see what I could do about repairing it. He brought it over, and he said that while it was there, he wanted me to replace the tailpipe on the van and change the air cleaner. I said I’d take care of it. Well, this was all in July of 2010, first week of July.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I repaired the tailpipe and the air cleaner, and I changed the speedometer sensor, but it didn’t fix the problem. I told Mr. Cernic that the dashboard would have to be removed and repaired. The speedometer in the dashboard was the problem. I priced it with Ford, and they told me it would be about $300 to have it repaired, but they couldn’t replace it because it was obsolete and they couldn’t get a new one. I tried to buy a used one in a junkyard, but they only used that speedometer in that one-year van, and it was very rare, so I couldn’t find a used one. I told Mr. Cernic this, and he said to get it repaired.\n\nPlaintiff: I took it to Park City Ford in Bridgeport, and a week later they called me that they had it. I went and picked it up, and I started to put it in. But before I could finish the job, I ran into a bit of a problem—well, rather, a problem ran into me. A car T-boned me on my motorcycle.\n\nJudge: Oh my goodness, that sounds bad.\n\nPlaintiff: It broke my leg, six ribs in multiple places, my clavicle, my shoulder, and I collapsed a lung. I was hospitalized in critical condition in intensive care for three days, and then I was transferred to a nursing home for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: I was in two different nursing homes for three months.\n\nJudge: Okay, let me ask you a question. You started to say something, and I want to make sure I’m following. You said, \"I brought it back in before I could work on it.\" I thought you said that you had taken it somewhere to be worked on?\n\nPlaintiff: I took the odometer out and gave it to them, not the car, just the odometer.\n\nJudge: Okay, so the last piece was that you were going to put it into the car?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: But I didn’t have a chance to do that because I got into the accident.\n\nJudge: Okay, and during that time, where’s the van?\n\nPlaintiff: In my yard.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Mr. Cernic called me in the nursing home and asked me if there was anything I could do so he could get his van back. Obviously, I was in no shape to do anything, but I did know a friend of mine, a mechanic friend nearby, that I called, and he agreed to try to fix Mr. Cernic’s van for me and finish it. He did come and finish it, and I called Mr. Cernic back and told him the van was completed and that he could pick it up.\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t learn this until a couple of weeks later when, by a quirk of fate, Mr. Cernic wound up in the second nursing home that I was in, right across the hall from my room.\n\nJudge: Oh my goodness. Okay, talk about fate. Alright, anyway, while he was in the nursing home, I went to visit him quite frequently, and he informed me that the van did pass the pollution test and everything was okay.\n\nJudge: Okay, why are you suing two years later for this amount? Why didn’t you collect from him then?\n\nPlaintiff: During this time, I’ve had seven major operations on my leg, and the fact that he had died...\n\nJudge: He didn’t die until January?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. I didn’t get out of the nursing homes until the end of October.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you were able to visit people and talk. You could write a bill and you could...?\n\nPlaintiff: It was pretty tough to get around. I was wearing an exoskeleton for six months.\n\nJudge: You didn’t bill him, and then he passes away in January, and then for all this time, you don’t bill anybody, and then all of a sudden, two years later, you remember that somebody owes you money from two years ago?\n\nPlaintiff: It wasn’t that I just remembered. I had seven major operations on my leg during that time frame, and I wasn’t really able to worry about a bill.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I did go to see Mrs. Cernic in the spring of this year and I told her about the outstanding bill, and she said she’d have to talk to her son about it and she’d get back to me. Weeks went by, she never got back to me. I went there a second time, and her son happened to be mowing the grass that day. She called him in, and he confronted me and was very irate. He said, \"Get out of the house immediately, and he’s going to call the police, and he ain’t paying me a nickel.\"\n\n[Music playing]\n\nJudge: The plaintiff did a bunch of work for the defendant until he almost died in a motorcycle accident. Things got really sidetracked, and now there’s an issue. The plaintiff says the defendant’s husband, who died, owed him for work, and he waited two years to press the claim. Let’s listen.\n\nDefendant’s Son: Talk to me real simple. Two months before he allegedly performed work on my father’s car—and for the life of me, I don’t know how my father could have driven that car to his house or picked it up afterwards, because he was completely incapacitated mentally. He could not drive out of the driveway without my mother being with him. Physically, he could not drive that entire year.\n\nJudge: How old was he?\n\nDefendant’s Son: 84 years old.\n\nDefendant’s Son: He was in rest homes and hospitals for nine months out of the 12 months in 2010.\n\nJudge: But let me get to the point here. In May of that particular year, I heard that my father had asked this man here to cut down his neighbor’s tree. I called him up on the phone. I said, \"John, you’re a good friend of my father’s. I said, ‘Please don’t do this. My father is suffering from dementia.’ There’s absolutely nothing wrong with my neighbor’s tree.\"\n\nJudge: The only reason he wants to cut it down is because he planned on splitting the wood with the neighbor. So what happened?\n\nDefendant’s Son: I stayed out of it because my father got involved. He said, \"Listen, John’s going to cut the tree down. I don’t care what you say.\"\n\nJudge: So this man didn’t respect my wishes?\n\nDefendant’s Son: No, he didn’t. But karma works in strange ways.\n\n[Music playing]\n\nDefendant’s Wife: Mrs. Cernic, did your husband pay his bills right away?\n\nDefendant’s Wife: Right away, and in cash.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you remember anything about the odometer?\n\nDefendant’s Wife: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me ask you about the whole tree situation. When the son gets involved and says to you, \"I would really rather you not do this. I feel like you’re taking advantage.\" Why did you go forward with it?\n\nDefendant’s Wife: I just felt it wasn’t his right.\n\nJudge: Okay. If we assume there is a debt, why would it be her responsibility to pay?\n\nPlaintiff: Because she inherited his estate.\n\nJudge: Well, you’re not suing his estate, are you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I was told I had to sue her, not the estate.\n\nJudge: You were misinformed. But why would any judge look at a situation where someone has been deceased for almost two years and say, \"Oh yeah, I’m sure that’s a legitimate debt with all this time that has passed?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t really want to sue.\n\nJudge: Yeah, you did. You know how I know? Because you did.\n\nJudge: You can’t sue the son, and you can’t sue the wife just because she’s the wife. Neither one of them need to pay you.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Playing the victim, Emotional appeal, Minimization, Persuasion, Framing the narrative"}
{"id": "371", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case in the docket: The Plaintiff dropped off a Hickey Freeman suit at the Defendant’s dry cleaner, says they lost the pants, and he wants a whole new suit. But the Defendant says he’s only on the hook for ten times the cleaning cost. It’s the case of \"I Want a Hickey Bad.\" Thank you, Douglas. Tobias Bloom?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing, let's see, we’ll call it \"The Cleaners.\" You don’t want us to use a company name, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the Defendant is represented here by the owner. You're the owner?\n\nDefendant: Yes. Ken Suana.\n\nJudge: Okay. You are suing for $500 for some pants that belonged to a suit that they have apparently misplaced. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, so I guess I dropped the pants off in August 2011.\n\nJudge: Have you been using these cleaners for a while?\n\nPlaintiff: I think it was a few months, maybe five or six months.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you went to retrieve the pants?\n\nPlaintiff: He first told me that they were looking for them. So I went back regularly for a week or two. I think Ken was away for a while visiting his mother or something, I'm not sure. So for a while, I was looking for the pants and coming back to the cleaner, and eventually, they told me they could not recover them. He offered me some compensation for them.\n\nJudge: Okay. And how much did he offer you?\n\nPlaintiff: He offered me ten times the cost of what I was going to pay to get them cleaned and repaired.\n\nJudge: And how did he come up with that figure?\n\nPlaintiff: He said that it was on the back of the ticket that he had given me.\n\nJudge: Was it?\n\nPlaintiff: It was, but I don’t feel that’s fair.\n\nJudge: Tell me why you don’t feel that’s fair.\n\nPlaintiff: The value of the item that was lost was far greater than what I was being offered.\n\nJudge: And what was the item?\n\nPlaintiff: Suit pants.\n\nJudge: Suit pants for what kind of a suit? Not just any suit.\n\nPlaintiff: It was a nice suit. It was the nicest suit.\n\nJudge: You're a snappy dresser. Show me the receipt for the suit.\n\nPlaintiff: I have the receipt right here.\n\nJudge: And I see everything else you bought that day too.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, that was the first time I—\n\nJudge: Who's this nice person with you?\n\nPlaintiff: This is my mom.\n\nJudge: Your mom. Well, you taught him well. Hickey Freeman, is that the name of the suit?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: There’s a Michael Kors suit on this receipt and a Hugo Boss pair of trousers. Nice. From Barney’s. Okay, so what happened?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Bloom dropped off his dry cleaning on August 25th last year. Then he came back to my cleaners on September 10th and tried to pick up his pants. On that ticket, he has one pair of pants and two shirts. So he handed me the ticket, and I went to get his dry cleaning. I found two shirts but didn’t see his pants. So I tried to look. Maybe in my cleaner, we arranged by the order number, maybe it was misplaced somewhere.\n\nJudge: Hold on one second. Why were you turning in just the pants of the suit as opposed to the whole suit?\n\nPlaintiff: I have never heard that they fade at a different rate. I turned it in mainly because the pockets were fraying a little bit.\n\nJudge: But you were having them dry-cleaned too?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Without the jacket?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: All right. Regular.\n\nDefendant: During the weeks, I tried really hard to look for his pants, called everybody, called every customer that I think might have accidentally received them, but had no luck.\n\nJudge: Did you really call every customer?\n\nDefendant: Every customer within the time frame.\n\nJudge: So a week later, he came back, and you told him you couldn't find them?\n\nDefendant: Yes. Sorry.\n\nJudge: Somebody out there is wearing a nice Hickey Freeman pants without a jacket. Have you ever in your life read the back of a dry-cleaning receipt? Be honest.\n\nPlaintiff: No, sir. Never.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff: Nope.\n\nJudge: Clean sweep. Going inside the courtroom. So you offer him the ten times the amount of the ticket, and that’s based on what?\n\nDefendant: That’s on the back of the receipt.\n\nJudge: Do you have his receipt?\n\nDefendant: No, I have my own.\n\nJudge: Let me see. You offered him $137.50, which is ten times the amount of the ticket regarding these pants. He denied it. He says no, that's not going to do it.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: So here’s the deal: your claim is limited to $137.50 plus court costs.

Let the record reflect the plaintiff has been sworn. Thank you. Welcome, all right, Debra Bueno, right? You are suing Helen, you've asked us not to mention your last name, and we'll respect that, for $500, that you say she still owes you on rental payments that you made when you moved in with her. But according to you, she changed the agreements after you moved in, and you are counter claiming against her for $500 because you feel like you gave her back too much money. Tell me what's going on here.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nOkay, I gave her $1,500 up front for three months' rent for the summer.\n\nJudge:\nAnd your plan was to live there for three months, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nShe wouldn't allow me to have an air conditioner. I was upstairs in a tiny small bedroom.\n\nJudge:\nWas there any written lease between the two of you?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, just this receipt, which you know, you can see that I gave her $1,500.\n\nJudge:\nWas there any written lease agreement?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, just this receipt.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so it was for the three months, and you did the right thing. You each kept the original copy of it. So go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nShe wouldn’t allow me to have an air conditioner, and when did you find that out?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI found that out when I moved in, and I said, you know, I'm going to get a small air conditioner, and she said, \"No, you can't.\"\n\nJudge:\nDid she say why you couldn’t?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWere your utilities included?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDid she offer you, \"Well, if you pay extra, you can do it\"?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, she didn’t.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nThe girl next door had an air conditioner, and her room was just a little bigger than mine.\n\nJudge:\nDid you say to her, \"But that's not fair, you let her have one.\" I mean, did you bring that up?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nWell, I didn't want to get into her business. I just feel that, you know, she was being unfair to me. That I didn't have one.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you say to her?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI said, you know, I can’t live this way all summer without an air conditioner.\n\nJudge:\nYou said that, and then you moved out that day?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, no, I was there for nine days.\n\nJudge:\nYou were there for nine days total?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo pretty much moved out, that’s alright. So go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nAnd also, I just want to show you some pictures. There was a long, like, 40-foot walkway before you get to the entrance, and she refused to keep a deck light on.\n\nJudge:\nDid you say to her, “There’s not enough lighting back here, can you put a light,” and she said no?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, it just happened to be dark, which of the two scenarios is it?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI saw her put the deck light on once, and I asked her, you know, can you keep the deck light on at night to walk? It's a long walkway.\n\nJudge:\nCan I see the picture?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nShe said no.\n\nJudge:\nWhat else?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI also wanted to show you a picture of the window that had a board, it held the window up, and maybe that was partly why she wouldn’t allow me to have an air conditioner. I don’t know if the window was broken. I don’t know.\n\nJudge:\nIs this how when you rented it?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWouldn’t it be wise to say to her before you rent the place, “Will I be allowed to have an AC?”\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nWell, I wasn’t informed beforehand that I wouldn’t be allowed to. I didn’t think that there would be an issue.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you moved out because she wouldn’t let you have the AC. Also, she always told me to park in front of this gold car, and there’s no way I could have fit.\n\nJudge:\nRight, right, in this picture?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nAnd I kept parking on the side, and she said, “You can’t because of the septic tanks.” I don’t understand why I can’t park, you know, on a septic tank. I don’t understand that.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, what’s going on? What happened? Did she get mad about the AC?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nNo, what happened is she got mad when she had a car accident in the driveway. She had already been in the apartment in the room rather for 10 days. She hit a car in the driveway. She told me she had a driver's license, and she told me the car was hers. I learned from the car accident she has no driver's license. It’s expired or non-existent; I don’t know.\n\nJudge:\nWhose car did she hit?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nMy friend Mega’s.\n\nJudge:\nIs she the one with the AC unit?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did she—did she ever ask you about an AC unit? Yes or no?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nNever even asked you.\n\nJudge:\nSo according to you, the reason she actually moved out is because what?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nBecause she hit a car in the driveway. She wanted the case to be settled away from the insurance company because she had no driver’s license for 10 years and because it was not even her car. So here she is with the car of a third party in my driveway in a car accident with no driver’s license.\n\nJudge:\nI called, I called, I think Mega called the police to talk about the accident and the police report to get a police report. And the first thing that I said to her when the policeman is there: “Debbie, move your car out of the driveway.”\n\nJudge:\nThese litigants were living in the defendant's house. The plaintiff was a tenant, but in less than 2 weeks, the plaintiff moved out because she couldn't have an air conditioner, and there were car issues. The defendant says the plaintiff hit a car in the driveway. Let’s listen.\n\nJudge:\nSo what you're saying, then, is she got mad because you would no longer allow her to park a third party’s car on your property?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nYes, because I didn’t want to incur liability to whoever the third party is. I felt if I did what she wanted me to do, I would actually be in a bailment kind of a thing with this third party.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, with her driving this car with no driver's license. Okay, well, alright. Let me ask you a question. Whose car is it, first of all?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nIt’s my car, but it's titled under my ex-husband. I won the car over radio.\n\nJudge:\nYou have a license?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nOkay, it's expired. I have a learner's permit.\n\nJudge:\nHow long has the license been expired?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nSince 2009. I was sick. I was hospitalized. I couldn’t renew it.\n\nJudge:\nWhy do you have a learner's permit?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nWell, now, because it expired for 3 years, and you have to, if it’s after two years, you have to do it over again.\n\nJudge:\nCan I see your learner's permit?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nShe's making up a story that has nothing to do with why I moved out. That’s irrelevant.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nNo, if you moved out ‘cause you no longer had a parking space because you hit the car, do you have an off button?\n\nJudge:\nI’m in the middle of a sentence. You think that's going to help your case?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nIt does matter. It is incredibly relevant.\n\nJudge:\nBecause if all of a sudden, it’s the way she’s saying, which is, \"You can’t park your car there, you don’t want to live there anymore,” that’s a real reason you don’t want to live there.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nSo don’t tell me that it’s not relevant. I know you have years of experience in courts, which is probably where you learned to roll your eyes at a judge. I know that, but you are wrong when you say that it’s not relevant.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI had already decided to move out. It doesn’t matter whether she says, \"I could park here or not,\" I had decided to move out because...\n\nJudge:\nDid you tell anybody about that decision?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI told her. I wrote her a note. \"I cannot live here without an air conditioner.\" Before I even bumped into that girl's bumper.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have that note?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nWell, she has it.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have that note?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nShe didn’t save it. Of course she didn’t save it. Never wrote a note.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nExcuse me, Judge. I had left her a note in the kitchen saying, \"There's no way I can live here without an air conditioner,\" and that was before I bumped into Ma's car.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nOkay, she’s disputing that you ever wrote that.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nShe can dispute that, but I did write it, and I left it.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any proof of it?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Now let's go to the next issue. You gave her back some money.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nHow much money?\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI gave her $1,000 back to settle the case and not go to court.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nThat's in, as far as I’m concerned, I am in court and it's extortion that she took $1,000 from me.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI have the settlement agreement. I crossed out the lines that said she would, you know, in front of three officers. The second day I went out, the day after the accident, with one policeman. I went out the next day early. I was gone all day. She moved her things out all day. She was waiting for me to get the money, the $1,500 back.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nI came back about 7:00 p.m. when we started to discuss the money issue. It got exciting, and I got on the phone and got a policeman to come over. Three policemen came.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nSo they let us work it out for two and a half hours. This went on. I’m going to settle it, I’m not going to settle it. I'm going to settle it, I’m not going to settle it, and the police didn’t just leave.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nNo, they were very patient.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nExcuse me. No, you cannot interrupt. They were very patient.\n\nJudge:\nAnd who wrote it?\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nI did. I wrote it. And I failed to notice when she signed it that she scratched out the part about we hold each other harmless in the future. But she failed to scratch out the part that says \"full settlement.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay, confirming Helen and Debbie have both agreed to cancel the previous rental agreement and institute a full settlement of monies Debbie paid Helen. The rental settlement is based on Debbie's turning over the key immediately and upon vacating today receiving $1,000 from Helen. Helen is receiving $500. Well, the $500 is hers, but each holds the other harmless.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nThese are the words that were crossed out by you.\n\nDefendant (Helen):\nNow, let me give you this, judge.\n\nPlaintiff (Deborah Buo):\nYes, I know.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, okay, no settlement.

She is turning to the court seeking justice for what the defendant is doing to her and is suing for the $857.47 she is rightfully owed.\n\nThis is the defendant, Javier Dorot. He says the plaintiff became very possessive and practically moved in with him after two months. He couldn't take it anymore and told her they were through. The plaintiff began harassing him and called him 24 times a day, to the point where he had to change his number. Next thing he knows, he's getting sued for gifts she gave him during the relationship. Bottom line—this lawsuit’s crazy, and he thinks the judge is going to agree. He’s accused of taking advantage of an ex.\n\nAll parties, please be ready.\n\nBailiff: All parties have been sworn in, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Jolie?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing Javier Dorot—how do you pronounce your name?\n\nDefendant: Javier Dorot.\n\nJudge: Javier Dorot, for $857.47 that you say he owes you and refuses to pay. What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: We met, we talked, we seemed to hit it off. We started seeing each other. I would come over to his apartment. I started staying over. His birthday came up, we went to a party.\n\nJudge: You started dating in September?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And his birthday was when?\n\nPlaintiff: September.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I brought over a few things. It was his birthday as well, so I brought over a few things.\n\nJudge: What are a few things?\n\nPlaintiff: I had brought over a comforter set. His TV went out, so I brought my TV set over. It just progressed from there.\n\nJudge: I'm still in September.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, we're still in September.\n\nJudge: So then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He was a Muslim. He gave me this prayer called shahada, which was supposed to— I only wanted to pray, but the prayer was supposed to convert me into a Muslim. I wasn't too happy with that. But I would pray with him while I was there. So I bought prayer rugs because his rug wasn’t that clean.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s skip past that. When do you start giving him money?\n\nPlaintiff: End of September.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He told me some story about how his account got frozen, and he couldn’t get access to his money. I had maybe $100 on me, so I thought, \"I don’t want to leave you without money.\" I gave him $75 until he could get to his money.\n\nJudge: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He was grateful, said it was kind and thanked me.\n\nJudge: Then you loaned him another $500. When did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff: The next couple of days.\n\nJudge: He hadn't paid the $75 back yet, and you still loaned him another $500?\n\nPlaintiff: He was still locked out of his account.\n\nJudge: Sounds like a him problem, not a you problem.\n\nPlaintiff: I know, I know.\n\nJudge: Did you have him sign any promissory notes?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you text him or record him acknowledging the loan?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I wasn’t thinking.\n\nJudge: What have you learned watching this show for 18 years?\n\nPlaintiff: I know, I know.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I loaned him the $500.\n\nJudge: Then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: We started having conversations, but he kept blowing up at different things I was saying. He would fly off the handle.\n\nJudge: Who broke up with whom?\n\nPlaintiff: I broke up with him.\n\nJudge: How did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: By text.\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"Fine, no problem, we don’t need to speak anymore.\" I told him, \"Call me in the next few days and make payment arrangements for the money.\"\n\nJudge: And what was his reaction?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"You don’t really care about me, you’re so petty.\"\n\nJudge: Let me hear your version, sir.\n\nDefendant: I’m not going to say she wasn’t generous—she was. From the very beginning, she was showering me with gifts. She brought roses, a comforter, a TV, everything.\n\nJudge: Was the comforter a gift?\n\nDefendant: She just brought it to me, opened it, and gave it to me. She didn’t say it was a gift, but I assumed it was.\n\nJudge: What about the money?\n\nDefendant: She offered it to me.\n\nJudge: You thought it was a gift?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She gave me everything else, so I assumed she was just helping me. The \"loan\" came up only after I broke up with her.\n\nJudge: When did you break up with her?\n\nDefendant: Early November.\n\nJudge: She has texts where you apologize for breaking her heart, saying she was the one who wanted to be friends. She doesn’t sound scorned—she sounds disappointed.\n\nPlaintiff: Also, he threatened my life.\n\nJudge: Did he threaten your life, or are you saying he did?\n\nPlaintiff: He called and threatened me.\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said he’d \"push my wig back.\"\n\nJudge: What does that mean?\n\nDefendant: It’s slang.\n\nPlaintiff: He served 16 years for killing someone.\n\nJudge: How did you meet him?\n\nPlaintiff: In a program for incarcerated individuals.\n\nJudge: Were you incarcerated?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, for drugs.\n\nJudge: I’m ordering him to pay you $575. He’s also to return the comforter and other items through a third party.\n\nDefendant: That’s fine.\n\nJudge: Let’s move on.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting, framing the narrative, playing the victim, minimization"}
{"id": "191", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff wants the defendant to pay up on a loan, and he doesn't care that they've known each other for 29 years. But the defendant says he doesn't owe the plaintiff anything; he's making it up. It's the case of \"Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot.\"\n\nJudge: Shannon Grant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, you are suing Richard Green for $1,325 that you want paid to you for parking tickets, impound fees, transportation, and lost wages as a result of tickets that the defendant got on a car of yours—car of his that you put in your name?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What are you doing doing that? Why did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: When you know somebody for over half your life, you grew up with them, you know their mother, father, and of course, when people just get married and have kids, and they ask for your help because of family problems... You know, I was going through family problems at the same time, and I was living on my own. So when he came to me reaching out, I felt deep inside, like, you know what? If my mother wasn't there to help me and I'm busting my behind working like he was at the time, I'd want a friend to do that for me.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but why did he need you to do that for him?\n\nPlaintiff: He had an accident with his brother's van, and it wasn't his fault, he said, or something like that. And there was a conflict within the family business that he worked in with them helping him get a car on the road.\n\nJudge: Why does somebody have to help him get a car? He's a grown man. First things first, just give me the answer. I know the answer is going to be because he has bad credit, right? That's going to be the answer.\n\nPlaintiff: Basically.\n\nJudge: Okay, how do you get bad credit?\n\nPlaintiff: Um... basically not paying your bills.\n\nJudge: Paying bills. I believe it wasn't just bad credit, though. It was worse than that.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, that's enough to not want to put a car in your name that he's driving because if he gets tickets, he's not going to pay them, right?\n\nPlaintiff: You're right.\n\nJudge: All right. So you decide to put a car he's driving in your name, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: And of course, like, if he ends up hitting a truckload of orphans, who do you think gets sued?\n\nJudge: You would.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: All right, so what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: What happened was it was supposed to be for a short period of time until he could just get on his feet, about three months, and four months, really. It was a six-month ordeal with the insurance.\n\nPlaintiff: Long story short, within a two-month period, I couldn't find Rich.\n\nJudge: You couldn't find him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: What are you talking about? This guy is like your blood brother, your best friend, who you have to... I'm making fun of you right now, so I don't know why you're chuckling. Okay, your best friend who you can't help but help out in his time of need because you've grown up together—how do you not find him?\n\nPlaintiff: I'm trying to avoid it, but uh... it's drugs.\n\nJudge: Who?\n\nPlaintiff: Who’s it was because of drugs?\n\nJudge: Whose drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: It was because of drug use.\n\nJudge: Whose drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: Everybody else understands the question I'm asking, right? Whose drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: He couldn't be contacted at his house or where he was at because his family and nobody had contact with him. He ran away from everybody.\n\nJudge: Okay, because of drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: His, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so now you can't find him. Did you know that he had a drug problem?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Well, apparently, you didn't know him very well to be putting the car in your name. So now he's run off, and what? Who's the lady next to you?\n\nPlaintiff: This is my fiancée.\n\nJudge: What does she think about all this?\n\nPlaintiff's Fiancée: [gives a dirty look]\n\nPlaintiff: Well, the thing—\n\nJudge: Oh, she just gave you a dirty look. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: The thing is, I honestly would have never believed that my friend would have ever put me through this...\n\nJudge: And yet here you are.\n\nPlaintiff: Here I am.\n\nJudge: Mr. Green, did you ever have a car in his name?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Did you get parking tickets on a car registered in his name?\nJudge: So, Mr. Green, let me hear from you. Did you ever have this car in your possession?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. I never had a car in his name, and I don’t know what he’s talking about.\n\nJudge: You’re saying you never drove this car?\n\nDefendant: Never. He never gave me a car; I never asked him to register anything for me.\n\nJudge: Mr. Grant, do you have any proof that this car was registered under your name for him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. Here’s the title, and here are the parking tickets.\n\nJudge: [looking at documents] So, these parking tickets—do you have any proof that he was the one driving when they were issued?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I mean, the car was for him. I wasn’t the one driving it.\n\nJudge: That’s not enough. You need something connecting him directly to these tickets.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, why would I pay for someone else’s car if it wasn’t his?\n\nDefendant: That’s what I’m saying! I don’t know why he did that.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mr. Green, did you know about these tickets before this lawsuit?\n\nDefendant: No. This is the first I’m hearing about it.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s a lie, Your Honor. I tried reaching him, and he ignored me. He knew.\n\nJudge: Mr. Green, did you avoid him?\n\nDefendant: No. I was dealing with personal issues, and we lost touch, but I didn’t run away from him.\n\nJudge: Mr. Grant, you mentioned something about drugs. Are you claiming that Mr. Green was using drugs at the time?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. That’s why he disappeared.\n\nJudge: Mr. Green, do you have a history of drug use?\n\nDefendant: That’s personal.\n\nJudge: I understand that, but it’s relevant. Did you have a drug problem at the time?\n\nDefendant: I had some struggles, but that doesn’t mean I owe him money.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, he’s dodging responsibility.\n\nJudge: Mr. Grant, I get why you’re frustrated, but I need direct proof linking him to the debt. Right now, I see a car in your name, tickets in your name, but no proof that he was the one driving it.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, why would I just make this up?\n\nJudge: People make things up all the time in court. I need proof.\n\nPlaintiff's Fiancée: He knew what he was doing. He’s playing innocent now.\n\nJudge: I understand your frustration, but the law requires evidence. Mr. Grant, unless you have something more, I can’t rule in your favor.\n\nPlaintiff: But—\n\nJudge: My ruling is for the defendant. Case dismissed.\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: So you say he's making this whole thing up?\n\nDefendant: I have no clue what he's talking about. I never asked him to put a car in his name. This whole thing is ridiculous.\n\nJudge: Well, we’re going to find out. Do you have any proof of the tickets and impound fees?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have all the paperwork right here.\n\nJudge: Good.

What’s going on here?\n\nPlaintiff: So basically, it started when Natalie and I were friends in high school, and we ended up going to the same college in Boston. Freshman year, we decided to do the dorm on campus, and after that, for sophomore year, we decided we wanted to get an apartment together.\n\nJudge: Okay. In freshman year, did you two get along?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: You were right in each other’s faces in the dorms?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Everything was hunky-dory?\n\nPlaintiff: So hunky-dory that we decided to get an apartment together.\n\nJudge: Exactly. All right, so you get an apartment together. It’s a one-bedroom apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: So each of you have a twin bed in the bedroom?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then there’s a living room?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Kitchen?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And each of your rent is $910?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. You move in together, everything’s great?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, good friends.\n\nJudge: Best friends. Wow. So sad. All right, so now you’re together in an apartment in your sophomore year, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: So at the beginning, everything was going good. I would say around maybe early December, we started just little arguments more and more, but everything was still—\n\nJudge: What was it about?\n\nPlaintiff: What do you think? It was more for me—I just saw her life going in different directions. I think our living styles were different.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m more of a neat freak, and I know this, and she’s a little messier than me.\n\nJudge: But didn’t you guys know that freshman year?\n\nPlaintiff: We did.\n\nJudge: You did?\n\nPlaintiff: But things just started—we just started bickering off of that.\n\nJudge: It got testy. I read the text.\n\nDefendant: If I may, though, prior to those text messages, there was one incident which I kind of mark as the starting point of all of this falling down. She decided to go to Virginia, I believe, for four days throughout the weekend, and I worked doubles—I was working over 70 hours a week while going to school.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And we had the dog in the apartment.\n\nJudge: What do you mean by “we had the dog”?\n\nDefendant: So her uncle said that when we moved into an apartment together, he would help us get a dog. So he purchased the dog for us. We drove to Maryland together over the summer and got the dog—like at six weeks old maybe or something.\n\nJudge: What a bad idea this is.\n\nDefendant: And then—\n\nJudge: Was there some understanding about whose dog it was?\n\nPlaintiff: So yeah, I mean, I always assumed that since her uncle paid for it, you know, it’s her dog, whatever.\n\nDefendant: But then—\n\nJudge: But then you guys were sharing the expenses?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you split the vet fees?\n\nDefendant: Yes, we split them until February, when things got sour.\n\nJudge: Okay. So about the Virginia thing—you were starting?\n\nDefendant: Yeah. So I worked all Thursday through Sunday. My schedule was doubles pretty much Thursday through Sunday at this place, so I would be gone 12, 13 hours a day. So she was going to be gone Thursday through Sunday. I simply asked a question—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: “Is there any way we can contact one of our friends to come to the apartment and help let the dog out? He’s a six-month-old puppy; we don’t want to leave him in the apartment all day long.”\n\nJudge: Which is why sophomores shouldn’t have dogs. That’s my theory. My personal theory is you’ve got plenty of time for responsibility later. I can’t tell you how short this little window you’ve got going on here is.\n\nDefendant: So she just got upset, I guess, by that question, and she said that, “If it’s going to be such a big problem for our dog to be staying in our apartment, I’ll just have my mother drive all the way up from Connecticut and take him home for the weekend.”\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: So I was like, “Okay,” taking a little aback, because there was a little bit of an attitude there.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: She started FaceTiming her boyfriend, complaining about that.\n\nJudge: About what?\n\nDefendant: About the dog.\n\nJudge: How do you know?\n\nDefendant: Because I could hear.\n\nJudge: Was she texting him or was she talking to him?\n\nDefendant: She was talking to him on the phone.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nDefendant: So I knocked on the door and I said, “If we’re going to be roommates, not friends, let me know, because there’s been a distance between us lately.” And she was like, “Don’t worry, we’ve been roommates for the past six months anyway.”\n\nJudge: So then?\n\nDefendant: That’s when I said, “Okay, I told her to her face that I would be moving out in May.”\n\nJudge: Okay, but you had a lease until August 31st.\n\nDefendant: Yes, but I gave her three options.\n\nJudge: Why should she take you off the lease?\n\nDefendant: Because her boyfriend had been living there.\n\nJudge: Okay, stop. If you guys think I’m going to sit here and try to figure out who was sleeping with who, what days, how loudly, whether it was your freshman year or your sophomore year, you are out of your minds. It’s not going to happen.\n\nDefendant: I know.\n\nJudge: Here’s what I know. Your name’s on a legal contract.\n\nDefendant: I know.\n\nJudge: I find in favor of the plaintiff in this case in the amount of $2,730, minus the $500 security deposit.

You want to be referred to as Malcolm?\n\nDefendant: Yes, please.\n\nJudge: You are suing the defendant for $3,533.61 in insurance fees that you say he owes you. What happened here?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, Mr. Malcolm came with his cousin in 2015. They needed car insurance. The cousin wasn’t working, and they couldn’t get insurance elsewhere. I specialize in assigned risk insurance.\n\nJudge: So you specialize in selling insurance to people who would have a hard time getting affordable insurance?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. Not those who can't get insurance, but those who can't get affordable insurance.\n\nJudge: Why were you having trouble getting conventional insurance?\n\nDefendant: Tickets.\n\nJudge: What was it?\n\nDefendant: Well, it was just that I hadn’t had a car insured in some time, and I did have a previous suspension for unpaid tickets.\n\nJudge: Okay. So just tell me what happened in this case. You sold him insurance on what date?\n\nPlaintiff: September 5, 2015.\n\nJudge: And you sold him insurance for a year. The insurance was going to cost how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $2,770 plus $50, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So then how much are you charging in finance?\n\nPlaintiff: What we do is take a risk. Until the ninth month that they pay consecutively, if they cancel or drop out, we lose money because we pay for months 10, 11, and 12 upfront.\n\nJudge: So until the 10th month, not the 9th month?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So his monthly payments were supposed to be what?\n\nPlaintiff: The first year, it came down to $236.\n\nJudge: So then, like, the last two payments of $236 would be the interest charges for financing. All right. So now, in that first year, they find out there’s a teenager in the house, and they raise his insurance. How much?\n\nPlaintiff: $458.\n\nJudge: Okay. From the inception of the insurance?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I asked him many times for a letter from the dean or whoever is in charge to prove that the young lady is studying at least 22 hours a week.\n\nJudge: And then what did you do? Did you ever tell your daughter she had to get proof she was living in Albany?\n\nDefendant: I guess because it was during her first year, she was getting situated in school. The process got drawn out, and I never actually followed through to get the information he requested.\n\nJudge: So now, the year ends. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: At the end of the year, they owed me $766.43 from payments they had not made.\n\nJudge: But how do you get to this $3,533?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s very simple, Your Honor. I kept calling Mr. Malcolm and his cousin. I said, “Guys, we have a new policy coming in on September 5. You have to pay the back amount plus the future amount.”\n\nJudge: What happened on September 5?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t go in. My cousin went in to make the payment.\n\nJudge: And what was the payment for?\n\nDefendant: To keep the policy from being canceled.\n\nJudge: So year two kicks in, but you guys still owe him money. What’s your defense?\n\nDefendant: My defense is that even though we dealt with David as the broker, I would still receive statements from the insurance company. From what I received, the amount I owed was different from what he said.\n\nJudge: That’s because you have to pay finance charges. Show me the difference.\n\nDefendant: This is the last statement I received from the insurance company. At the time of cancellation, it shows a balance.\n\nJudge: Did the insurance get canceled?\n\nDefendant: I let it lapse.\n\nJudge: How come?\n\nDefendant: Because I knew that after having insurance for a year with no major violations, I could get something more affordable.\n\nJudge: So you’re suspicious because this notice says the premium due is $1,699, but you were paying $2,770 for the year, which would be an additional $1,071 in finance charges. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: I prepaid two months. The difference was $60.99 because I had already prepaid part of his insurance.\n\nJudge: According to your invoice, you’re out $1,463.61. That’s the insurance he hasn’t paid for. Why are you now asking for $3,533?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, the insurance company still wants more money.\n\nJudge: But you haven't proven that. I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff for $1,463.61.

I was also told by the defendant that when I come back by myself, things would be discussed.\n\nAt that time, I said, \"I will never be alone in your presence because I am bullied.\"\n\nHe has even falsely accused me of something.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did he falsely accuse you of?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOn the day of my move-out, as we were walking out the front door, my son and I had some of my belongings in our hands. He suddenly said, “Hey, hey, you! Someone stole my tools out of my garage!”\n\nJudge:\nOkay…\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was shocked. He then said, “Yeah, I see your face.”\n\nJudge:\nShow me how your mouth looked.\n\nPlaintiff:\n(Opens mouth wide)\n\nJudge:\nOkay, that looked good—agape.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe then said, “I know you did it, but I can’t prove it. But I know you did it, or someone you know did it, or your friends did it.”\n\nAt that point, I was honestly shaken. I wasn’t expecting it. It was like a sneak attack—he came right out of his garage.\n\nAlso, when I was moving my belongings, he made a point of moving his car just a few inches away from a bush, so my son and I had to either push a bush out of the way to carry our belongings out to my car or walk around two-foot-tall grass.\n\nDefendant:\nI’m not going to be harassed!\n\nPlaintiff:\nHarassed? By who?\n\nDefendant:\nBy you.\n\nPlaintiff:\nBy me?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, why don’t you ask my friends where the tools are that you—you accused us of stealing?\n\nJudge:\nOkay, okay. Let’s focus.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWho are you?\n\nDefendant’s Friend:\nI’m his friend, who you accused.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI don’t even know you!\n\nDefendant’s Friend:\nOh my God. Didn’t you just tell her the other day, “I think your friend stole the tools” when I was by myself?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYou blamed me? Or I had something to do with it? Or my friends? Those were your words.\n\nJudge:\nThis whole situation seems unnecessarily hostile, especially if you’re trying to get your security deposit back. Why didn’t you just tape the walkthrough quietly instead of all this hostility?\n\nDo you think that I could have predicted that you’d end up in court based on how hostile everything was?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI understand why I want my security deposit back.\n\nJudge:\nRight. So let’s talk about it.    Judge:\nRight. So let’s talk about it.\n\nDefendant:\nThe place looks very good in the video she took when she moved in. She told me she was going to have a dog in there. I went along with it and I told her—generally, and we’ve been renting for many, many years—generally, there is a payment every month for a pet. We decided to avoid that, to void that, and we didn’t charge anything for the dog. But then a month later, I learned that she had two cats in there.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you learn that?\n\nDefendant:\nWe went up there.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Are you folks—Is this a two-family house?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you live downstairs?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant:\nShe, uh—In fact, at one point, she asked us to take care of the cats.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So there’s no dispute that you had cats?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI never tried to conceal them or hide them.\n\nJudge:\nSo, and is it accurate that the cats were adopted by you after you moved in?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, they’ve been with me for years, actually.\n\nJudge:\nThis was not a secret at the time?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nThat wasn’t my question. Is it accurate that you moved into the place with one dog and two cats?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat is correct.\n\nJudge:\nOr did the two cats come later?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I moved in with them.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever tell him that you had two cats?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI told the leasing agent who was there at the time of the signing of the lease.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So, and according to you, you didn’t know about the cats?\n\nDefendant:\nNo. At some point, she asked me to take care of the cats.\n\nJudge:\nSo you knew about the cats?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever say to her, “You owe me another $100 in rent, $50 for each cat”?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nSo if a landlord just starts harassing you, saying, “I want you to do this, I want you to do that” three months into a one-year lease, can you break the lease, get your deposit back, and walk away scot-free?\n\nBystander:\nNo, you can’t because they have it in writing.\n\nJudge:\nThey do have it in writing. So therefore, when you have papers going to court, the judge is going to see that. And you signed on that, correct?\n\nBystander:\nFair enough.\n\nJudge:\nBut at a point, if they harass you, can you break that lease?\n\nBystander:\nHarassment is never okay, but I don’t think you can break the lease.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nJudge:\nSo you are—Here are the things you feel she owes you. You feel she owes you $275 for the oil bill for March through April. Do you dispute that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. So then you would agree that you owe this amount, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Let’s talk about something else. Let’s talk about carpet cleaning and painting. I saw a video of a really clean apartment. Why—What is it? Do you have pictures to show me?\n\nDefendant:\nNot only the carpets, but I also have the bills from the carpet company.\n\nJudge:\nThe bills from the carpet company?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat are they saying?\n\nDefendant:\nThat there was a urine smell. Yes, they could not remove it. I had to change the carpet.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat happens with cats. Both of my cats are females and fixed and never spray.\n\nJudge:\nAnd I’ve yet to see a carpet cleaning company say the smell of cats can’t come out and recommends replacements. And they charged you $100 to come to your house?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did they do? Did they clean?\n\nDefendant:\nThey tried cleaning, but the smell didn’t come out.\n\nJudge:\nSo did you pay them $100 to clean?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. So what you’re suing for is not new carpets, you’re suing for the two cleanings?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, correct.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. And then what—What’s the painting that would be required?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe painting—I have something to explain to you. The painting—He charged me $200, but then he put down that to remove the things on the wall, he wanted to charge me $150 extra. I didn’t pay him.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Now I want to—I want to see pictures of the way she left it. Do you have pictures of the way she left it?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou were there 27 months, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. What is this a picture of?\n\nDefendant:\nUh, the kid used to put stickers on the wall, and there were—\n\nJudge:\nIs that a wall?\n\nDefendant:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what is that? What’s that dark mark?\n\nDefendant:\nIt pulled the stickers, and it pulled the paint with it.\n\nJudge:\nOh, look at that. Took the whole chunk out. What was that? What was on there?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt was one of those command strip hooks.\n\nJudge:\nWell, you didn’t put it up right. Those things work like a charm.\n\nDefendant:\nThere were three or four of them.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. And then what is this?\n\nDefendant:\nThis is just her garbage that she put by the garbage.\n\nJudge:\nIs that her carpet she put out?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Maybe she just didn’t want it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI didn’t want it.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So it would appear to me that you owe the oil. That’s $275. It would appear to me that you owe the carpet cleaning. It would appear to me that you owe the painting because there were several places where drywall is ripped out, and somebody has to fix that. And I don’t think that $200 is an unreasonable request for that.\nJudge:\nThe big chunk of money, the biggest chunk of money, and the problem that we’re having is the $2,600.\n\nDefendant:\nThat’s for lost rent.\n\nJudge:\nRight. Because you say she broke the lease.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI gave my notice, your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. When did you give notice?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI told them in January that I would be leaving at the end of February.\n\nJudge:\nAnd when was your lease supposed to end?\n\nDefendant:\nApril.\n\nJudge:\nSo you left two months early.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWas there a written notice?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, it was verbal.\n\nJudge:\nDo you agree that she gave you verbal notice in January?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but the lease required written notice.\n\nJudge:\nDid you attempt to re-rent the apartment?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but we weren’t able to find a tenant in time.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you start looking?\n\nDefendant:\nFebruary.\n\nJudge:\nAnd when did you find a tenant?\n\nDefendant:\nApril 1st.\n\nJudge:\nSo the unit was vacant for March and part of April?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nNow, did you keep her security deposit when she moved out?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, we applied it to the unpaid rent and damages.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Here’s where we are. You did break the lease early, but you did give verbal notice, and the landlord attempted to re-rent the unit. However, in most cases, a landlord has to show that they made a reasonable effort to mitigate damages.\n\nDefendant:\nWe did, your Honor. We listed the unit immediately.\n\nJudge:\nRight, and you found someone by April. Now, based on the lease agreement, she was responsible for rent through the end of her lease term. However, landlords can only claim lost rent if they made a reasonable effort to re-rent the unit. Since you did re-rent it within a reasonable timeframe, I’m going to allow one month of lost rent as a fair claim.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI don’t think that’s fair. I left the place in good condition.\n\nJudge:\nYou still had a lease, and you left early. That means the landlord had the right to hold you responsible for the time it was vacant. But I’m only allowing one month instead of two because they found a new tenant fairly quickly.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nHere’s my ruling. The security deposit was $1,500, correct?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou are entitled to keep the $275 for the oil, the $100 for the carpet cleaning, and the $200 for the painting. That totals $575. You are also entitled to one month of rent for March, which was $1,300. That brings us to $1,875. Since that amount exceeds the security deposit, I am ruling in favor of the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I don’t get any of my deposit back?\n\nJudge:\nNo. The costs exceed the deposit amount.

{"id": "419", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says that his landlord had it out for him because she didn't like his friend. But the defendant says the plaintiff and his friends smoked lots of pot and damaged the place. It's the case of \"Smoking The Joint.\" Thank you. You're welcome.\n\nJudge: Okay, Ricardo Torres, you are suing Karen Reyes for $650, the amount of your security deposit that you are saying she is wrongfully withholding. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Around the month of September, I was looking to acquire a room, and I was hanging out with one of my friends, which so happens to be her neighbor. And, um, I see her bringing out the sign that says \"Room for Rent,\" so I asked my friend if he knew Karen, and he said yes, that he would let her know that I was interested.\n\nJudge: So you're interested, and you decide you're paying $450, and then what happens that you start paying $650?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, I acquired, uh, she had a bigger room in the same apartment.\n\nJudge: So then you're there for how long before the problem begins?\n\nPlaintiff: I was there entirely for about seven months.\n\nJudge: Okay, now at some point you decide to leave. Which is what month?\n\nPlaintiff: March 30th.\n\nJudge: March, okay. Now, when you leave, you tell her when? That look, I'm not staying.\n\nPlaintiff: I told her about two weeks prior to that.\n\nJudge: Because?\n\nPlaintiff: And then she got mad because she felt like it wasn't enough notice.\n\nJudge: Yes. All right. Do you have a lease?\n\nDefendant: My lease is under my name.\n\nJudge: Oh, do you have a lease with him, is what I meant, because you're a landlord to him.\n\nDefendant: Yes. We didn't make a lease because he was just renting a room at that time.\n\nJudge: I understand, but when you say your feeling is he gave me no notice, he gave me... okay, how much notice do you say he has to give you?\n\nDefendant: Thirty days.\n\nJudge: Says who? Says where? You don't have a lease. What are you talking about?\n\nDefendant: One of the agreements when he rented the room.\n\nJudge: Verbal? It was an agreement?\n\nDefendant: Stop and listen. A verbal agreement or a written agreement?\n\nDefendant: A verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you agree with her verbally that you would give her 30 days' notice before leaving?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Now you have a problem with that. See, when there is no lease, written lease, there's still a lease. You can have a verbal lease, but the law fixes what the terms are, not you. If you want terms outside of that, then you have to get them in writing and get both sides to sign it. The law where you're from, in the Bronx, he doesn't have to give you 30 days' notice. I don't get it, but that's how it is. So, yeah, if you want 30 days' notice, it better be in writing somewhere. Is it in writing anywhere? In an email? A text? Anything?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: No. All right. But according to you, there's more. When he leaves, he ends up leaving the place damaged. Was he a good tenant while he lived there?\n\nDefendant: No. I actually had to always, um, let him know the rent was due on the first.\n\nJudge: That was one thing that was verbally said, that was agreed on? When was it always due?\n\nDefendant: The first.\n\nJudge: It would be the first. It'll be the morning, and you have to ask him in the afternoon because you have to give the rent to the owner?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So when you say he would pay late, you mean late on the first?\n\nDefendant: Late on the first. Sometime the second.\n\nJudge: Okay. Were there any other problems?\n\nDefendant: Um, he used to smoke around the house. He used to do spray paint in the house.\n\nJudge: He used to smoke... cigarettes?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Marijuana?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can you tell him to stop?\n\nDefendant: I told him. That was one of the number one rules because I knew he was smoking, and that was one of the number one rules. I told him no smoking allowed in the house because I have a three-year-old asthmatic child. That was one of the rules. He said fine.\n\nJudge: So why didn't you get rid of him when he was violating it? I was waiting. Why would you put your asthmatic child in that?\n\nDefendant: To be completely honest, uh, overall, even though that was that one little problem, he told me he didn't smoke in the house. I was never around the house, to be honest. I was always working and in school.\n\nJudge: What about your kid?\n\nDefendant: He was in school.\n\nJudge: So it was only basically the nights when he would be home?\n\nDefendant: Every night when you're home, your kid can't breathe. No, never. Not every night. He couldn't breathe, obviously. He had his asthma machine. But, yes...\n\nJudge: Where's the machine? Because this guy's smoking in the house. Why don't you just get rid of him?\n\nDefendant: I was trying to tell him, you know, I asked him nicely.\n\nJudge: So now, but according to you, he damaged the place?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see the pictures of the damage.\n\nDefendant: Everything has been fixed. I don't have any pictures. Everything was fixed.\n\nJudge: So can a landlord get a tenant’s case in 2017 for smoking pot? Yes. Okay. Well, lady, do me a favor. Pay the man his $650 and learn how to be a landlord. Verdict to the plaintiff.

Tell me what happened on June 2nd of 2011.\nPlaintiff: I walked out of my driveway to go to the dumpster which is across the alley from my home, home to put some trash in the dumpster. As I got to the end of the uh, as I looked to the end of the alley, I saw uh Tiffany Walker um on a scooter at four years old um riding alone on the scooter.\nJudge: A regular scooter or an electric scooter?\nPlaintiff: Electric scooter.\nJudge: Okay, she's four?\nPlaintiff: She's five now.\nJudge: She's five now, but she was four then?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Um, I proceeded to put my trash in the dumpster uh and walk back to my property. Right before I approach my property, I noticed the, the um Tiffany Walker uh, she, I flying down the alley. I didn't have a chance to move. Next thing I know, boom, she ran right into my ankle and split my ankle open. I have uh my evidence here, my pictures. I split my ankle open.\nJudge: Okay, let's see. Did you go to the hospital?\nPlaintiff: Yes I did.\nJudge: And what did they do to you at the hospital?\nPlaintiff: I had to get stitches and I had to get h a tech shot.\nJudge: How many stitches did you get?\nPlaintiff: Um, I think it was a total of six that they gave me. Here's all of the pictures.\nJudge: Do you have the medical record?\nPlaintiff: Yes I do. I have all of my medical record.\nJudge: What did you do after she hit your ankle? What did you do?\nPlaintiff: Um, when once she hit my ankle I ho-\nJudge: Did that knock her off the scooter?\nPlaintiff: No, it did not. She was crying saying \"I'm sorry.\" She didn't get knocked off the scooter or anything. She um said \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" I hopped in my house. I immediately uh got on the phone. I called my daughter who is my witness here today. And um, I was crying cuz I was in a lot of pain and I told her, asked her if she could come and take me to the hospital. The reason I call my daughter is because she's in the medical field. She advised me to, she would be right there but to call 911 and to call the paramedic and that's what I did. The paramedics arrived and so did the uh police uh department. They arrived uh when the police got there. He asked me what happened. I told him that there my neighbor's four-year-old daughter was on a scooter riding unsupervised and she um lost control of the scooter and hit me. Uh, the police, the police-\nJudge: Is this a picture of the kind of scooter we're talking about?\nPlaintiff: That, that is one that I took uh at, at when I went to Walmart just to show, but there's a picture of the actual scooter that I took that he, that they had on the bike porch and I took a picture of it from my yard.\nJudge: Okay, go on.\nPlaintiff: Um, so when the police officer arrived, he uh asked me what-\nJudge: Was your daughter riding that scooter for real? Excuse me, was your daughter riding that scooter for real? Cuz she's, if she's four years old, how could you have her on a motorized scooter?\nDefendant: She's been riding since she was three. She's been riding four-wheelers, dirt bikes.\nJudge: Why would you have- but why would you have her alone? Was she alone?\nDefendant: She wasn't alone. She was with my son. I was- I was in-\nJudge: How old is your son?\nDefendant: My son's six. But I was-\nJudge: So she, the three-year-old was- the four-year-old was supervised by a six-year-old?\nDefendant: No, I'm just saying she wasn't riding alone. I was there supervising him. I was in my backyard.\nJudge: So why are you telling me that the six-year-old was supervising?\nDefendant: No, I was saying he was there. He was there.\nJudge: You were not- where were you?\nDefendant: I was in my backyard.\nJudge: Okay, but she's not in your backyard riding. She's in an Alleyway riding. So the answer to my question is that the four-year-old was being supervised by a six-year-old?\nDefendant: I guess so.\nJudge: I mean, you're lucky she didn't rip her face off in the concrete and take a sp-\nDefendant: What is it you like? She been riding since she was-\nJudge: This is just irresponsible parenting. I mean, as turns out it's just- no, no offense but it's her ankle that got cut, but it could have been your daughter who like lost half her- she could have been seriously injured. Why would you-\nDefendant: The scooter only does 10 miles an hour. How much damage you think you could do to a four-year-old's face in 10 miles hour? She rides her bike faster than the scooter. Both of them can ride their bike faster than that scooter goes.\nJudge: Well, I don't think she should be riding her bike alone in an alley of four either. Oh my God!\nJudge: Welcome back to the People's Court. Harvey Levin here. So uh, is it too young to put a 4-year-old on a motorized scooter? What do you think?\nHarvey: Absolutely.\nJudge: Why do you say?\nHarvey: Well, if they're being supervised with a 6-year-old, I think that's really-\nJudge: But even if they're being supervised by an adult, is it too young to put a kid like that on a sco- on a motorized scooter?\nHarvey: Uh, maybe not with an adult present. Um, actually uh, being a Psychology major, I know that the child does not uh have the correct motor skills to be able to operate um anything that has a motor on it.\nJudge: Well, you wanted to get that Psychology major in really bad, didn't you?\nHarvey: Yeah.\nJudge: I can tell you did.\nJudge: Going, going inside the courtroom.\nPlaintiff: So uh, the police officer arrived. When he um came to my home, he asked me what happened. Uh, I told him what happened uh, that the neighbor's four-year-old daughter was in the alley alone. There was no-\nJudge: How did you first learn that she had been injured?\nDefendant: Right after that, right after it happened they came home and told me.\nJudge: Whose they?\nDefendant: The children, yeah.\nJudge: Okay, and then what did you do?\nDefendant: I did nothing really.\nJudge: They tell you that they've injured the neighbor and you don't walk over?\nDefendant: They didn't tell me they injured the neighbor. They told me that she walked out. They didn't tell me that anything happened. I didn't- I didn't think anything happened.\nJudge: What did your children tell you?\nDefendant: They, they told me that she walked out in front of Tiffany. Drew said he stopped, my son, he stopped on the side and Tiffany tried to turn. I guess she moved at the same time and that's why Tiffany-\nJudge: That's not enough to get you to go see if the neighbor's okay?\nDefendant: We, we have problems. I don't, I don't- I don't talk to her.\nJudge: Excuse me, tell me about that.\nDefendant: Well, I've been living there two and a half years. My kids are in the motorcycles, four-wheelers from day one before we moved there. They, we all have everything. So when I moved there, it was always okay at my last address to let him ride in the alley. When I moved there, like the second day she called the cops, told him not- at that time my son was riding his dirt bike in the alley, told, told the cops that my son was riding a dirt bike. From that point to this point, I've had the cops calling me about everything about-\nJudge: About what?\nDefendant: The kids continuously riding in the alley, my son, over and over again, but it's your fault for calling the police. It's never, it's my son, my son has a, has a little friend, 6 years old. They were riding their bikes up and down the alley. He turned in her driveway and turned around and came back out. She called the cops because that happened.\nJudge: Okay, would you like to see the pictures of her ankle?\nJudge: Apparently something happened, right?\nDefendant: I know something happened. I feel like it's her fault, so-\nJudge: But you feel it's her fault?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: And it's her fault because she had the temerity to walk to the dumpster, which is what the Alley's for?\nDefendant: Excuse me, no, she because she had nerve to use the alley and the fashion in which it was intended, which is to house the dumpsters and put the-\nDefendant: Well, not- not, that's not what I'm saying. I feel like it's her fault for not looking before she walked out into a rightway that's used by-\nJudge: You weren't there. How do you know what happened?\nDefendant: Cuz that's my son, that's my son and my daughter.\nJudge: Son is six. Aside from the fact that he's not here to testify, he's the- the reason, the reason I'm believing this is because according to her story, she saw my daughter way down the alley. She saw her drive down the alley for no reason, just lose control and crash into her. Yeah, how-\nJudge: I mean, I don't understand how, why you don't understand how a four-year-old could lose control of a motorized scooter and run into somebody.\nDefendant: And that's the problem.\nJudge: See, that's exactly the problem. That you hear that and you say, \"I don't understand how that could happen,\" because if you were an appropriate parent, you could understand how something like that could happen and you wouldn't allow a six-year-old supervisor four-year-old on motorized scooters in the alley. That's not okay. It's not okay.\nJudge: Show me your medical bills please. Do you have a scar?\nPlaintiff: Yes I do.\nJudge: Would you- yeah, I'd like to see it.\nPlaintiff: You want-\nJudge: I'll come down. All just hold on before. See? Yeah, I can see it. I think you've got your strap right on it.\nJudge: Are you out of pocket the $2,554.89? Did you have to pay that? That is-\nPlaintiff: That is, that is the amount that uh is in collections right now.\nJudge: Okay. Um, and if I must say Judge, they are talking about putting a lean on my property. I am a homeowner.\nJudge: They going to put on lean on your property because he's going to pay you. He's going to pay you. There's a cost to being that free and letting your children roam. We have laws, okay? How many kids do you have?\nDefendant: Four.\nJudge: Watch your kids. You owe it to everybody else in the neighborhood, but you also owe it to your kids.

If we think you don't get that much more under the ruling, I guess I don't see why the previous point isn't right, that this is just game over.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, let me answer that by coming back to a prior concurrence in another case, because that concurrence -- and I'm operating under the assumption that we're working with the same precedent here -- that concurrence specified at page 105 that the terrorism bar contained discrete factual predicates. There were six or seven types of activity that there --\n\nJudge: But you know a gang here, like -- the premise of the question was not just that you knew the general statute. I understand you think that's not enough. But if you knew further that it was because of international gang membership, membership in an international gang that conducts violence and would likely conduct violence in the United States, why isn't that enough? That's different than just a statutory citation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because in almost all of these cases, Your Honor, there's going to be factual information, like DHS tells individuals in the domestic context, that can be provided without damaging national security. So, for example, the State Department lists in its foreign affairs manual the 10 factors that officers are supposed to consider. Whether they --\n\nJudge: Mr. -- Mr. Lawyer, can I take you back to the Chief Justice's question?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Certainly.\n\nJudge: And I don't think you can answer this question by referring to regulations. It's a constitutional question. And his question as I understood it, and I have the same question, is how do you weigh the liberty interests that you are asserting against the government's interest in denying visas to people who would present a danger when they get to the United States? How do we weigh that? If the respondent’s husband were a citizen, it wouldn’t matter whether he was a member of MS-13 or any other gang or whatever the government suspected him of being involved in criminal activities. She could live with him unless he were in prison, right? So it's an absolute -- it's a -- it's a very, very extensive right. Now you're translating it into the -- the situation where it's -- it's the opportunity to come here. How do we -- you know, how do we figure out how much she gets?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I think that has everything to do with the text of the statute that the government cites when they make that decision, separating the couple. So, in this case, as -- as the Court knows, it was this very broad language. It was -- it was -- I will concede that the terrorism statute also has some broad language.\n\nJudge: But, again, I don't think you can answer this constitutional question by citing statutes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, but --\n\nJudge: There's a -- you say there's a balancing. And you've got on one side a right that would be very, very weighty were they both U.S. citizens living in the United States. And then you're willing to dilute it so that it's only this big when the person is -- is -- wants to come into the United States.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And -- and I think the Court has addressed a similar context in the prison-type cases. Previous cases have recognized an underlying substantive constitutional interest, for example, in not being forced to take psychotropic drugs or not being removed to a mental facility, and yet it -- the way it balanced those interests was by providing a minimal level of procedural due process. And I think one of the points that is important to consider thematically here, Your Honor, is consular officers work very hard. They have very heavy caseloads. They're working under very difficult conditions. And what we're asking for is for them to give us enough information to help them make a decision that's going to foster the government's --\n\nJudge: So, Mr. -- Mr. Lawyer --\n\nJudge: But what if a -- just let me --\n\nJudge: No, go ahead.\n\nJudge: If I could follow up. What if an American citizen wants to have a child who is a non-citizen admitted to the United States? Would the same thing apply there? Or an American citizen wants to have a non-citizen parent admitted or an American citizen who doesn't believe in marriage wants to have a non-citizen admitted to the United States so that person can live in an intimate relationship with that person in the United States? What about all those situations?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the only person that's going to have both the -- and I want to take a half step back in answering that and try and define the interest precisely as well. The only person who's going to have an interest directly deprived is going to be a spouse. You have to have both an underlying liberty interest, which we get from the Constitution, and you have to have a direct deprivation, which we get from the statute. It totally distinguishes the facts here from previous cases, where the home care patients had no statutory role to play whatsoever in the certification process, et cetera. But -- so the point I'm trying to make is that -- and the Court understands that immigration law is quite complicated, I don't want to go on too long on this, but citizens can only petition immediate relatives and citizens have to be adults to petition immediate relatives. So the Court -- so all those other floodgates concerns are exaggerated because the only person who's going to both be statutorily involved enough to have been directly deprived and have an underlying liberty interest in marital cohabitation --\n\nJudge: Well --\n\nJudge: Mr. --\n\nJudge: Well, is there a liberty -- do those people have a liberty interest? And if they do, then how can it be deprived by statute? How can it be taken away by a statute?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, for example, a grandparent and a grandchild, they certainly would have an underlying liberty interest. But they wouldn't be able to petition each other. So my point is that you have to have both these elements. And -- and that's going to be my answer to all the floodgates concerns that Your Honor posits because you need to both -- and there is no -- the Court has not recognized a substantive --\n\nJudge: It's not a flood --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- liberty interest in adult cohabitation.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That's it, period.\n\nThere are collateral consequences, but, as I noted in my intro, those collateral consequences can be challenged separately.\n\nFor instance, on every noncitizen who's granted voluntary departure, they must post a monetary bond.\n\nWe keep the bond.\n\nIf they want the bond back, they simply say: I want my bond back. DHS will adjudicate.\n\nHere, DHS has already said: You violated your -- this is in Footnote 4 of our brief.\n\nYou violated the voluntary departure period.\n\nTherefore, we're keeping your bond. They can --he could challenge -- I don't -- he could challenge that before the agency's administrative process and then seek APA review.\n\nHe could, while he's in the country, for instance, seek to adjust status with DHS. DHS would probably say: Can't adjust status, you're barred.\n\nThen you get judicial review of that through normal APA review.\n\nWhat's happening here is a jurisdictional provision that is designed to review only final orders of removal is being used to review something that has nothing to do with a final order of removal.\n\nJudge:\nBut, Mr. Yang -- Mr. Yang, you -- you --you, in making that argument, seem to be relying on Nasrallah and suggesting that only orders that relate to the removability qualify as affecting the validity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nJust --\n\nJudge:\nAm I wrong about that? No?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nI -- I haven't quite finished the --the categories of things --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nSorry.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n--that were -- were captured.\n\nThere is the final order of removal --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n-- as Nasrallah explains. There are things that affect its validity --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n-- which then merge into the final order.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nIn addition, you can raise issues together with the final order of removal.\n\nAnd there's -- there's another category which we think is included.\n\nReview of a final order should include rulings that affect how to implement the final order.\n\nFor instance --\n\nJudge:\nOh, there we go.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nRight.\n\nHow to implement the final order.\n\nJudge:\nThere we go.\n\nYeah.

I mean, I thought you were a good textualist, Mr. Yang.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nWell, when I start --\n\nJudge:\nAnd it says that we have --we have authority -- the court of appeals has authority to review final orders of removal.\n\nIt -- it -- that's it.\n\nThat's what it says.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nThat's true.\n\nAnd it says that judicial review of all other questions -- this is a zipper clause in (b)(9) -- are available only in judicial review of the final -- of a final order under this section.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nIf it's so obvious, how come you didn't raise it below?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nThat I --I can't -- I can't speak to.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nNeither can I.\n\nJudge:\nMr. Yang, not only did you not raise it, I thought you affirmatively represented to the Tenth Circuit that there was jurisdiction in this case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nNo.\n\nWe said there wasn't but for a different reason.\n\nJudge:\nYou said there wasn't --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nWas not --\n\nJudge:\n-- but for not -- not for this reason.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n-- for a statute -- statutory prohibition on --\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nSo what --what do you do about the fact that Nasrallah itself recognized that evidentiary rulings merge into final orders?

{"id": "703", "dialogue": "Judge: Now one wrinkle to that, though, is I don't think the life insurance proceeds -- the only permitted use for them was the redemption, and the government makes something of that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct, and that's why I didn't pick up on the word \"earmarked\" in your question --\n\nJudge: Right. Right. Yeah. And --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- because money is fungible.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And so I think our analysis would be the same if you were talking about $3 million that happened to be some other non-operating asset.\n\nJudge: It's still a $3 million liability.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It would still be offset. And, indeed, in this case, the life insurance policy was not for $3 million. It turns out it was for $3.5 million. We're in all -- we're all in agreement that the remaining $500,000 is an asset, a non-operating asset that should be on the company's books. And so all we are doing here, I think, is giving effect to the broader framework which not just Congress but the Treasury and the IRS has set up here, which is a framework that says that when you are in the hypothetical world conducting this analysis, you assume that the hypothetical buyer and seller take all relevant facts into account.\n\nJudge: You -- you said --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And --\n\nJudge: Keep going, I'm sorry.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I think that the problem with the government's approach is that the government's approach requires you to do one of two things: either to disregard the offsetting liability or to assume -- and I think when you look at the government's italicized hypotheticals, all of them effectively do this -- to assume that your hypothetical buyer is somehow going to be able to capture the life insurance proceeds. That was the flaw with the court of appeals' reasoning because the court of appeals posited a situation where you had a buyer not just of the 77 percent of the shares but of the entirety of the company. Of course, if a buyer could get their hands on both Michael's shares and Thomas's shares, presumably the first thing that buyer would do is to extinguish any redemption obligation, not that that redemption obligation would make any sense in that hypothetical, and to have the benefit of the $3.86 million in corporate value and the $3 million in life insurance proceeds.\n\nJudge: Something you said that I think is critical to your position is that the net worth before, on the day of, on the day after, a month after, after the life insurance and the -- and the redemption has occurred or whenever after that, is -- is constant.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, and that is different from a voluntary redemption. Much ink is spilled both in the government's brief and -- and in the briefs of the amicus law professors on the fact that when you're dealing with a voluntary redemption -- let's say a publicly held company decides on the next day to redeem shares, at that point it is true that you are going to have a diminution in the net worth, which ensures that the remaining shareholders' stock remains relatively constant. That actually turns out not to be true when you're dealing with publicly held companies because often the stock will move up or down in response to such an announcement, but I think that basic principle is one that we don't disagree with. But everything in the government's brief presupposes that a voluntary redemption and a contractual obligation to redeem shares are treated exactly the same way. And I think the problem is that if you're a hypothetical buyer looking at the company, a redemption obligation is like any other debt. You see that on the corporate books. And that is $3 million that is going out the door. Now, to be sure, this is a hypothetical buyer. And so we are presupposing that the buyer is not attempting to buy the shares that are subject to the redemption obligation. That would, again, be impossible under the terms of the buy-sell agreement, and even if they could, they would be entitled only to $3 million, and we're disregarding that figure.\n\nJudge: On -- on the professors' -- Professor Chodorow and Professor Hellwig's amicus briefs, obviously they've spent a lot of time thinking about this issue. They're against you. Do you want to -- maybe you just covered it in your view, but where do they get it wrong? Maybe your point is the voluntary redemption is where they -- where they get it wrong, but I'd like some more explanation because they -- they clearly have studied this.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I -- I think that that is -- the fundamental flaw is that they really presuppose a voluntary redemption, and so many of the principles that they set out and, indeed, the four principles that the government sets out are principles that we have no objection to in that context. In this context, by contrast, again, it's that a hypothetical buyer would not somehow disregard this redemption obligation. The hypothetical buyer would take it into account and recognize that the funds that are coming in are going out the door again. And to be clear, this results in no windfall whatsoever to anyone, other than the benefit to Thomas that's going to be taxed. I think when the government says that the purposes here are not legitimate, there's nothing in the case that we disagree with more. The reason that closely held corporations engage in these transactions, as the Chambers amicus brief explains at some length, is precisely because this is a way of ensuring continuity of operations without engaging in disruption. If you don't have the life insurance proceeds here, most of these companies, which are typically very small, are going to have to dip into operating assets or otherwise engage in some sort of transaction to ensure continuity. If you have an heir who doesn't want to run the company or if the heir is someone outside the family, you have a very real risk that that person will not be interested in running the company or that you'll have a disruption of operations.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "564", "dialogue": "Judge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI think our position is that there are certain times in medicine, history has shown, where the states in their traditional role as regulators have -- have had to intervene.\n\nAnd that's not because --of course, the parents are trying to do the best they can and get the best treatment for -- for their kids, but we've had multiple instances in -- in somewhat recent history where we have stuff like lobotomy, eugenics, that had wide -- widespread acceptance among the medical community, and the state had to intervene as a regulator to protect the children.\n\nJudge:\nMr. Rice, just to let you kind of finish what you started to say to Justice Kavanaugh, you agree that the parental rights question is not before the Court, so it would be open to parents to continue to press that point in other cases?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWe agree.\n\nAnd we think Chief Judge Sutton got it right, but we agree.\n\nJudge:\nCan I just ask you about -- I don't understand at all the similarly situated argument that you make, and I hope that you can help me because I don't know how you can say both that girls and boys are not similarly situated at step one, when this law is being evaluated, and it's not making a sex-based classification. It seems to me that recognizing their lack of similarity, as you do, in making the argument is making a sex-based classification. So --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYour Honor, I think our position is that if you're in the point where we're treating giving testosterone to a boy with a biological deficiency as the same thing as giving testosterone to a biological -- a healthy biological girl who wants to transition, then there has to be some threshold inquiry that recognizes the biological differences between those two -- those two --\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nBut, when you're doing that, you're making a sex-based classification.\n\nI mean, the very argument carries with it the characterization that we're trying to identify here.\n\nYou -- you start by saying it's different to treat a boy who's using this medication for a particular reason from a girl who's -- okay, so that's a sex -based classification.\n\nHaven't we dealt with step one, now we should be going on to step two --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\n-- intermediate -- intermediate scrutiny applies by -- by the terms of what you're arguing.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI -- I --I don't think that we agree that we've checked the box at step one because there is no medical treatment that boys can receive that girls cannot, so we -- we disagree with the notion --\n\nJudge:\nDidn't we already dispose of that kind of reasoning with our equal protection cases that looked at things like interracial marriage, where we said, even though it applies to both, it's still making a racial classification? Even though whites can't married -- marry non-whites and non-whites can't marry whites in the statute, right, so both are equally disadvantaged, we said that's not an argument for why you shouldn't have a heightened scrutiny or why the statute is not making a race-based classification.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nAnd that's not the argument that we're making, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nSo what is your argument?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWe are not arguing that -- that you can discriminate and draw lines so long as you do so both against boys and against girls.\n\nWe're arguing there is no sex-based line.\n\nIf you're a boy and you go in to get puberty blockers, you can get the puberty blockers if you're going to use them for precocious puberty.\n\nYou cannot get the puberty blockers if you're going to use them to transition.\n\nThat is not a sex -based line.\n\nThat is a purpose-based line. So our fundamental point here is not that you can discriminate against both sexes -- both sexes in equal degree.\n\nOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here.\n\nAnd the only way to get to a sex-based line is by equating fundamental --fundamentally different treatments that defy medical reality and defy -- defy how the statute itself sets out what is a treatment.\n\nJudge:\nAnd the treatments are different because of the biological sex of the person, right? I mean, that's what you've said.\n\nThe purposes are different because of the biological sex and why you're going in to get them?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nNot at all.\n\nI mean, with puberty blockers, the purpose -- nothing turns on --on sex.\n\nTake puberty blockers.\n\nThere's nothing that turns on sex as to --to whether there's a sex-based classification there. Everything depends on what is the reason that you are using those puberty blockers for.\n\nI'm happy to take more questions if the Court has them.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Thomas?\n\nJudge:\nA number of times you've mentioned off-label uses of -- of these hormones.\n\nThe --what are some of the other off-label uses that are not legal in Tennessee?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo, for example, Your Honor, testosterone, we have a separate law that --that prohibits the use of testosterone for hormonal manipulation intended to increase muscle mass strength or weight without medical necessity.\n\nWe have -- like every state, we regulate medicine and we regulate the use of drugs.\n\nYou cannot use drugs in the State of Tennessee if it's not for a legitimate, viable medical purpose.\n\nHere, through this law, all that we have done is make clear that these treatments, which are irreversible often, have significant effects on minors and often leave them with bodies that are infertile and permanently damaged, that you have to wait until you turn 18 to receive those type of treatments.\n\nJudge:\nA number of times you've tried to say that --what classification that the State of Tennessee has advanced in this legislation.\n\nWould you spend a few minutes on that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nSo, again, we think that our law fundamentally draws a distinction based on medical purpose.\n\nI'll go back to puberty blockers.\n\nIf a boy wants puberty blockers, the answer is yes if you have precocious puberty, no if you're doing this to transition.\n\nIf a girl wants puberty blockers, the answer is yes if you have precocious puberty, no if you're doing this to transition.\n\nThat -- that is fundamentally a different treatment, and what is turn --what is dictating under this law is the use for which you are putting the drug.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "998", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I ask before you—before you go on, I'm wondering whether some of the problem here might be that we are not really focusing in on the fact that there are different kinds of experts in different kinds of testimony.\n\nAnd so to the extent that this rule says that it relates to an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition, and it was generated in the context of a dispute about testimony related to the psychiatric or, you know, physical condition of a particular defendant, I'm just wondering whether the problem might be that this is really directed at not this kind of testimony.\n\nThe kind of testimony that comes from an expert who hasn't examined this defendant, doesn't know anything about this defendant, and is talking about framework or, you know, general modus operandi, whereas this rule seems to be targeting the kind of expert who has examined or knows something about this defendant's mental state.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that's correct as a historical description of what Congress had in mind here when it enacted 704(b), but I think the logic of that intuition supports our position in this case, not Plaintiff's, and that is because when Congress enacted Rule 704(b) against the backdrop of robust, public debate about what appropriate testimony—what appropriate expert testimony—should be offered in criminal trials involving the insanity defense, it was clear to everyone at the time that Congress was not eliminating all expert testimony in insanity trials.\n\nJudge: No, of course not.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The—the text of the rule—\n\nJudge: I mean, isn't—isn't the line—I thought in the text had to do with whether it's an element of—of the offense or—or the defense.\n\nSo, for example, in Hinckley, an expert could still get up and say and opine on Mr. Hinckley's mental state. To the extent he has schizophrenia, he can say that.\n\nAnd what they can't say is: And, therefore, Mr. Hinckley—or the—or the—any other defendant—did or did not have the mental state required to either convict or to make out an insanity defense.\n\nThat's the line, isn't it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. And I think that is just an articulation of our position in this case.\n\nAnd—and—to return to our earlier exchange, and I think this again goes to your question as well—\n\nJudge: And so—and so—so if that's the case—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —everyone understands—\n\nJudge: If that—if that's the case, counsel, what's the difference between saying:\n\nA) Mr. Hinckley didn't understand right from wrong.\nB) A hypothetical person who meets all—looks just exactly like Mr. Hinckley couldn't have understood right from wrong.\nC) All persons with the—with the characteristics of Mr. Hinckley do not understand right from wrong.\n\nWhat is the difference between those three statements?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If—if I've understood the examples that you have offered, those are all just variations on the expert taking the stand and saying that the defendant, in fact, met the legal standard. And, again, if I could step back—\n\nJudge: And so they should all be—they're all impermissible, aren't they?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think those all could be impermissible, if—if I've understood the three examples.\n\nBut, again, earlier I think one of—one of—one of our exchanges was about, well, isn't it only—the fact that it is coming into court at all shows that it's being offered to prove the defendant's mental state.\n\nAnd I think the Hinckley example shows that can't be the correct understanding of Rule 704(b).\n\nEveryone understands when you're calling your examining expert in a trial involving the insanity defense to offer that expert's diagnosis of the particular defendant's mental state, the reason it is relevant is because you want the jury to draw some inference about whether the defendant does or does not meet the insanity defense—\n\nJudge: So—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —the—the legal standard for insanity.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's prohibited on 704(b) grounds.\n\nJudge: If we think about the insanity argument, I mean an expert can come up to the stand and say a person with these sorts of behaviors or sorts of symptoms, I would say that that person has schizophrenia.\n\nThat's fine, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nAnd then could the person then say, I think that all people with schizophrenia have the necessary capacity to form an intent as to this crime?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think that that would be objectionable on 704(b) grounds.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I doubt it would be reliable, but it wouldn't be objectionable on 704(b) grounds.\n\nAnd—and—and—\n\nJudge: Because that to me—okay—is—is what the Hinckley controversy was about and why Congress passed this rule, that it didn't want the expert to go from the step of saying: Looks to me like this person has schizophrenia, to the conclusion that, okay, once we say that, we can say that this person has the necessary intent because all people with schizophrenia can form—you know—have the necessary intent or not.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, I think the problem with the particular testimony that Congress was targeting in Rule 704(b) is that the expert is drawing an explicit link between the defendant and the legal requirement that the jury has to find.\n\nThat's what Congress said, no more of that.\n\nJudge: Well, that—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It created a public—\n\nJudge: —that is what the expert in my hypothetical is doing, because he's saying this defendant has a certain kind of disease and I'm going to tell you what people with this disease—you know—whether they're capable of distinguishing right from wrong or whether they're capable of having some other necessary intent for the crime.\n\nSo he's saying, as a fact of the matter, in his professional opinion, that 100 percent of the people with this disease are going to have this intent.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, well, I think you have just—that's a variation on the syllogism that we identify in our brief at pages 28 to 29.\n\nIf the expert says everyone in this category—if you are in category X, it follows that you have mental condition Y, and also I as an expert have diagnosed the defendant as being in category X, you have just broken down one impermissible opinion into two steps.\n\nAnd we do think 704(b) would keep that out.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Am I oversimplifying this, or is there a reason to apply Barker to a situation that is not about timing?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think you're looking at it correctly, Judge. While the timing question in $8,850 tracks the Barker test, our claim is different.\n\nJudge: So why is it different?\n\nJudge: I didn't understand that.\n\nJudge: Yes. Why is it different?\n\nJudge: The only reason you're asking for a retention hearing is to get the car back sooner. That’s a timing question. Barker established one timing rule, and the claimants here want another, more generous one. This isn't about process for process’s sake—it’s about people wanting their property back sooner. So isn't this still a timing issue?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: You can view it as a timing question in a broad sense, but that doesn’t mean the issues are the same. Consider the criminal context as an analogy. The Barker speedy trial right is about reaching a final determination quickly, while a separate right under Gerstein ensures a probable cause determination within 48 hours. If a trial happened within 48 hours, the probable cause hearing might be unnecessary, but that doesn’t mean the rights aren’t distinct.\n\nSimilarly, here, there’s one interest in getting a timely ultimate determination—that's what was at issue in Von Neumann and $8,850. But there's also a separate interest in retaining property during the time it takes to reach that determination. If a final ruling came in 48 hours, we wouldn’t need to worry about an interim hearing. But in reality, it takes much longer.\n\nJudge: Counsel, it seems odd that we’re debating which precedent applies rather than focusing on what the Due Process Clause requires. It’s a strange framing of the question.\n\nAlso, while I recognize that some jurisdictions use civil forfeiture as a funding mechanism, where recovering property requires navigating difficult bureaucratic hurdles, that doesn’t seem to be the case in Alabama. Your client waited 13 to 18 months before filing for summary judgment. Why not file on day one? It’s an innocent owner defense—they knew the facts of their ownership. What delayed them, and how is that delay attributable to the state?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I believe this is the right case for the Court to decide how to approach the question of whether a hearing is required. Whether we’re talking about the facts in Alabama, Wayne County, or hypothetical cases like you mentioned, the core methodological question remains the same.\n\nJudge: But even if a hearing were required, couldn’t your client have secured one by filing a summary judgment motion immediately? If so, what are we doing here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: There’s no guarantee that a summary judgment motion filed on day one would have been considered on an expedited basis. There’s no evidence that the court would have acted quickly.\n\nJudge: But there’s no evidence either way, is there?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Under Mathews, this raises the question of whether additional process would have had value. If, on remand, the state could show that summary judgment motions in Alabama are routinely granted in a matter of days, then perhaps an additional hearing wouldn’t be necessary.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "724", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit holds that Rule 704(b) prohibits only explicit opinions that the \"particular defendant had the state of mind required to convict.\" The government appears unwilling to endorse that full test. It seems to agree, contrary to Ninth Circuit precedent, that Rule 704(b) forbids an expert from testifying that people in the defendant's position always have the requisite mens rea.\n\nSuch testimony never explicitly mentions the defendant, of course, but as the government seems to recognize, it is clearly in the rules of -- in the words of Rule 704(b) an opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite state of mind. In other words, it establishes a class of individuals, including the defendant, and it assigns a mens rea to that class.\n\nAgent Flood's testimony here was no different. He testified that in \"most circumstances,\" people like the defendant know they have drugs in the car when they cross the border. The only difference between that testimony and absolute class-wide testimony is that he posited that people like the defendant usually, instead of always, have the requisite mens rea. But any such distinction is immaterial.\n\nImagine an expert took the stand and said: I believe the defendant in this case probably or maybe 80 percent of the time -- or maybe there's an 80 percent likelihood had the requisite mens rea. Obviously, Rule 704(b) would prohibit that testimony. And the testimony here is exactly the same. It expresses an opinion, a probabilistic opinion instead of an absolute opinion, but an opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite mens rea.\n\nSo that leaves the government's final objection, that Rule 704(b) should not be construed to prohibit what the government calls inferentially relevant testimony. And we agree with that proposition. The rule that I'm advocating today has been employed by the Fifth Circuit for over 20 years, and it makes clear that modus operandi evidence, for example, things like drug traffic organizations use couriers to transport drugs across the border, that they -- that drugs are extremely valuable, are perfectly legitimate.\n\nThe rule in the Fifth Circuit is that testimony from which a jury might infer mens rea is perfectly permissible, but testimony that assigns a mens rea to the defendant or people in her class is not okay. And that's what Agent Flood did here, and for that reason, we'd ask the Court to reverse.\n\nJudge: You put quite a bit of weight in your argument on the preposition \"about.\" And that was a stylistic change, certainly non-substantive. Do we normally put that much emphasis or that much weight on stylistic changes to statutes?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think what I would say, Your Honor, is the Court obviously puts a lot of weight on the text of the statute. And so I start with the current text of the statute that is current law.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, even with that, it says \"about defendant.\" It doesn't say \"about\" someone else. So you're saying that even if it's indirect, it's about this defendant?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Let me say two things, Your Honor. First, to finish my answer about the word \"about,\" what we say is that preposition is important, just like the prior preposition \"as to\" before the stylistic amendment --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- because it makes clear the Ninth Circuit's clear statement rule requiring an explicit opinion is too narrow. So that's what the preposition \"about\" does. Now you also asked me about \"the\" defendant. And our position there is very simple.\n\nIt is that that word covers either a direct statement about the particular defendant or a statement about a class of people, including the defendant. I don't think the government disagrees that the rule covers a statement covering -- I'm sorry, that the rule covers a class of people including the defendant as long as it's stated in absolute terms.\n\nSo, if I understand the government's position correctly, it agrees you need not mention the explicit defendant. If you talk about a class of people that includes the defendant and say those people always have the requisite mens rea, I think the government agrees, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, that Rule 704(b) applies.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought the --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And all we're saying -- sorry.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought the argument there was that if you say \"all defendants,\" all people in this class do this, then it obviously would include the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that's exactly right, Your Honor. So the only move left from there is to say, if the expert were to testify people like this almost always, virtually always, 99 percent of the time, probably, in most circumstances, all of those are still opinions about whether the defendant had the mens rea.\n\nThey're just not absolute opinions. But they're still stating an opinion about whether a class of people including this defendant have the requisite mens rea. And I think that's why the text of the rule, opinions about whether the defendant had the mens rea, covers this exact case.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "502", "dialogue": "Judge: You've referred a couple of times to the necessity defense, so could you tell me how that would work?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. Under Oregon law, the necessity defense is effectively the lesser of two evils. If a person says they had no legal alternative other than breaking the law, then their actions were involuntary in some sense. However, it is a very narrow defense and applies only in specific situations.\n\nJudge: Suppose there is a homeless person with no available shelter beds and no place to go. They must sleep, and it's cold outside, so they use a blanket. If a police officer finds them and the person says they had no other choice, would the city still pursue a penalty?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If they received a citation, they could assert a necessity defense in court.\n\nJudge: But are you instructing officers not to issue citations in such cases? Or are you saying citations should be issued, and then the courts will decide?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Officers have discretion in these situations, and they are supposed to connect individuals with services first. These laws are a tool to get people the help they need.\n\nJudge: That doesn't answer my question. Is the city telling officers to issue citations in those circumstances?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, it is a matter of discretion.\n\nJudge: Is there any directive telling officers to act consistently with the necessity defense, ensuring that those in dire need are not cited?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There is nothing in the record showing that officers were instructed about the necessity defense.

{"id": "12", "dialogue": "Judge: Do you happen to know how many shelter beds there are in Grants Pass?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I believe the only shelter beds, at least at the time the record in this case was compiled, were at the Gospel Mission.

I didn't quite understand it in your brief because I thought individualized findings had to do with the class action, but that question hasn't been certified here.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, but I think our basic point is that a person does not have an Eighth Amendment defense or claim unless they truly do not have another place to reside. By speaking of individualized findings, what we were --\n\nJudge: So --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- saying is that it depends on whether that person has some other place, such as a relative's home.\n\nJudge: I accept all of that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: I guess what I'm asking you is -- and this is what I didn't understand from your brief -- are you saying that there can't ever be a class certification of homeless people?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: That you have to have individuals? Or are you saying that the injunction is too broad if it doesn't provide for remedies that require the person to prove a certain --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The --\n\nJudge: -- number of things before --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- they're entitled to the injunction?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah. Yes.\n\nJudge: I wasn't sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, the Eighth Amendment claim is a personal one and, in this context, depends on whether the person has another place to sleep. So the person cannot benefit from the Eighth Amendment claim without showing that they have no other place to stay.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. If the town next to Grants Pass, 10 minutes away, has just completed building a homeless shelter with many vacant beds, does that change the analysis? Would there still be a right to sleep contrary to the ordinances in Grants Pass, if someone doesn't want to be taken 10 minutes away where there's a shelter?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That goes to the question of whether the beds are available. If they are just across the town line, it would be appropriate to take into account that there's a homeless shelter there, even though it's not in the City of Grants Pass. Often, two towns might cooperate to have one homeless shelter.\n\nJudge: They might, but often the next towns don’t always cooperate. So what if it's 30 miles away? Is the shelter available in that case for your purposes, or are you going to tell me it just depends on all the circumstances so municipalities won’t have much guidance?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it depends on the accessibility. One of the fundamental points here --\n\nJudge: The accessibility is that when an officer in Grants Pass finds a homeless person and says, \"You violate our ordinance, but I will give you a ride down the road, 30 miles, to a new homeless shelter,\" and the person refuses, can that person be given a citation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think probably not, but let me explain why.\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Obviously, there are questions at the margin. But one principal issue is that the city is seeking to banish or expel its own residents—people whose children may go to school there, who may pay taxes there. If the 30-mile-away shelter requires the person to leave their community, that implicates --\n\nJudge: How far does that go? Let’s say there are five cities around Grants Pass, all with homeless shelters. And yet, a person says, \"I've been a Grants Pass resident for a long time; I don’t want to go to one of those shelters.\" Can that person be given a citation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that would be a serious problem because the city’s ordinance would be requiring its own residents to leave.\n\nJudge: You would say it would be a problem to give them a citation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, I think so, because the city would be implementing a policy of banishing people from Grants Pass.\n\nJudge: Banishment is a strange word when you're talking about something 10 minutes away.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, again, the question is whether you can still realistically be part of the community where you grew up. The records show that most homeless people in Grants Pass are from Grants Pass.\n\nJudge: Counsel, many people have mentioned this is a serious policy problem. The solution, of course, is to build shelter for those who need it. But municipalities have competing priorities. What if there are lead pipes in the water? Do you build a homeless shelter or take care of the lead pipes? What if there isn't enough fire protection? Which one do you prioritize? Why would you think these nine justices are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We're not suggesting that building homeless shelters is the only solution. Time, place, and manner restrictions are a sensible approach. Oregon state law requires that. For example, a city could have a provision that prohibits sleeping on sidewalks because it obstructs movement, camping near a school, or sleeping downtown, but might allow sleeping in a designated park that is patrolled for safety.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And I'm trying to understand why the lower court was wrong, and I think I have a theory, and I'm hoping you can help me determine whether or not I'm right about this.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: I'm wondering whether the lower court—whether they were just taking what is a basic principle related to probable cause in another context. The other kind of Fourth Amendment claim that one might bring is the unlawful seizure, false arrest, etc. There, you have no probable cause. And we would say that if there are three or four different charges being brought and your claim was unlawful arrest, when you proved lack of probable cause with respect to only one of those three or four charges, we would say: Too bad, you still lose, right? So it's sort of like the same idea that the lower court was latching onto because it—there are cases that say that, but it seems like they're in a different context. They're not malicious prosecution theory. It's the unlawful arrest theory. So it's like probable cause is doing different work depending upon the theory. Am I—does that make any sense?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's exactly right.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So that's exactly how the lower court justified this rule.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It said the same rules apply to false arrest and malicious prosecution. But both at common law and in this Court's Fourth Amendment cases, there has always been a distinction between the warrantless arrest context, where, as Your Honor notes, it doesn't matter if the officer had one charge or ten charges or zero charges in mind, what matters is if there's probable cause out there somewhere, and the legal process cases like Gerstein and Franks and County of Riverside, where you're required to specify the charges, and that's for a couple of good reasons that I'm happy to explain.\n\nJudge: And, I mean, is one of them because the malicious prosecution context is really about the culpability of the process server? It's about the person who is initiating process maliciously? It's not really about whether you were committing bad behavior—so, in other words, you could have a person who actually is a criminal, right, he's committing crimes, but for Charges 2, 3, and 4, but if Charge 1, there was no basis for it, baseless, and maliciously added on to the thing, that person would still—added on to the indictment, that person would still have at least theoretically a claim for malicious prosecution with respect to that charge?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's exactly right. And that's reflected, again, in this Court's Fourth Amendment cases. So, to take an extreme example, Gerstein says that if you don't have process, right—no warrant, no hearing—it doesn't matter if you're actually guilty of absolutely everything. It's still a Fourth Amendment violation because we care about the process. The Fourth Amendment says what makes a seizure of any duration reasonable is that someone neutral and detached weighed in and signed off on this. It's not just the police officer's discretion. And what the \"any-crime\" rule would do would basically move this back into a police officer's discretion if they could just lie to the magistrate about the set of charges they have on that side.\n\nJudge: So what are we disputing here? Both sides agree that the lower court got it wrong. I guess I'm trying to understand why we're continuing on.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think—\n\nJudge: Like, what is—what is left of this case if the fundamental issue has been essentially resolved? Should we have appointed someone on the other side of the question that was presented here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I don't think so because, you know, I do think Respondents are arguing for an affirmance on a sort of waiver plus this other element theory. I think that this just means it's an easy opinion to write. So just last week, in Sheetz, this Court said, when there's radical agreement that the court below erred in applying a categorical premise, we leave all the kind of additional nuanced arguments for remand. I think this Court should follow the same course here.\n\nJudge: Well, radical agreement is a good thing if it exists, but I'm not quite sure there is radical agreement here. I thought the argument on the other side, which is presented in Respondents' brief and also in one of the amicus briefs, which I don't have with me, is that the lower court had a prior decision in which they essentially adopted the Solicitor General's position, and what they did here should be understood in light of that. Isn't that the argument on the other side?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think the other side is making two arguments. One is the one that Your Honor articulated, which is that somehow the lower court secretly was applying a different rule. But, as the United States says at page 23, that description conflicts with the language of the decision below.\n\nJudge: Yeah, okay, so there's a dispute about what they did here, whether they were following—I’ve forgotten the name of the earlier lower court decision.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Howse.\n\nJudge: Okay. Whether they were following that or not. So there's not really radical agreement as much as one might like to have it.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think that there is disagreement about how the \"caused a seizure,\" \"resulted in a seizure\" element works in the nuances, right? What counterfactual you run, how exactly—whether it's the legal process could or the bogus charge would have or the bogus charge could have. But that's a separate element from lack of probable cause. And I think everyone agrees that the decision below, which said, because probable cause existed on at least one charge, his malicious prosecution claim failed, full stop, right? That's the holding of the decision below. Everyone agrees that's not correct. That's not the rule.\n\nJudge: And just to clarify on the \"caused the seizure\" point, your position—say we don't reach it—on remand would be it doesn't matter if it actually caused the seizure, it doesn't matter if these misdemeanor offenses would have led to the same amount of the three days in detention? That would be your position, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I'd articulate it slightly differently.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I would say that the tainted legal process surely caused the seizure.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That's about real-world facts.\n\nDefendant\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo, if you want to amend a complaint to say: I made a mistake, I said that I was from Florida and the defendant was from Illinois, but I realized that the defendant actually moved to Florida two years ago, so we're both from Florida, the amended complaint would control there.\n\nDefendant\nRight.\n\nAnd then, on Footnote 6, let me just -- I know you're going to disagree that it controls.\n\nIf -- if it does control, I mean, if it is binding, it goes against you in this case, correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nOf course.\n\nAnd then I win under Grable or Merrell Dow.\n\nDefendant\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd, you know, I just wonder, so you look at Footnote 6.\n\nTo me, Footnote 6 is like somebody said: Hey, but how about Cohill? And then they said: Oh, yeah, Cohill, so we have to put in Footnote 6.\n\nAnd -- and so the fact that Footnote 6 is there suggests a certain kind of reading of Cohill.\n\nAnd, you know, what Cohill was about that it -- was this question of do you have to dismiss a case or can you remand the case back to the state court? But Cohill's logic does cut against you, I think, fairly heavily here because, as I read Cohill, what it does is say something like this: You know, the supplemental jurisdiction business, ever since Gibbs, we've understood it as a completely discretionary area of jurisdiction.\n\nYou can keep the case.\n\nYou can dismiss the case.\n\nIf you can keep the case and you can dismiss the case, surely you should be able to remand the case as well.\n\nAnd that's the essential logic of Cohill.\n\nIt's like everything is discretionary in this area, why shouldn't this be too?\n\nBut that logic really does cut against you because it suggests that everything is discretionary in this area, including keeping the case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah, a couple of responses to that, Judge.\n\nWhatever amount of discretion I think existed in the Cohill era I don't think can continue through binding statutory text.\n\nSo we're no longer operating in a common law realm. We're operating in a realm where Congress chose to act.\n\nWe can debate whether Congress chose to codify whatever the common law rules were hook, line, and sinker.\n\nI would suggest from Allapattah that it codified binding statutory text, and we should follow the text.\n\nSo I don't think we can just go with free-wheeling old principles now that Congress --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, how about if I think that the text doesn't really help either of you?\n\nThe -- you know, you're saying text; you're saying text, and, in fact, neither of you really has a very strong argument about text and we have to decide this case on other grounds.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "462", "dialogue": "Judge:\nI think that the concern raised, though, is when the agency has said -- has approved the project and a court comes in and says -- in this new, as you say, suite of statutes era, and says even though the agency approved the project, even though the project and all the effects comply with all the substantive environmental laws that have been passed over the years, which regulate very extensively, obviously, we, court, are going to come in and second-guess. So I -- I don't think your answer focused on that particular problem and the deference given that -- maybe it's just extra deference given the -- the overall situation now.\n\nMaybe \"extra\" is the wrong word but just -- just appropriate deference.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo I think that where an agency recognizes that there is an environmental issue and that it will be dealt with in the mitigation process -- or, I'm sorry, in the review process by other agencies, which could be state or federal agencies, that rationale might well be -- be sufficient all by itself to -- to satisfy NEPA review, but what we're -- what we're discussing here is a different question, which is whether the ring fence around NEPA should be drawn so tightly that the agency doesn't have to ask that question at all. I mean, as I said a moment ago and I think this really is one of the most important pieces of this case, that how much the agency has to do under NEPA is different from saying that certain effects are beyond the scope of NEPA so that the opposing counsel’s aggressive view of harmless error can come in and over -- and fix an agency's flawed decision-making on grounds that the agency itself did not give. That -- that, I think, is -- is the core of the point, that even -- even where some agency has -- some other agency has responsibility, the first -- that agency is going to be at the table in the NEPA review. The first agency may well be able to rely on the -- on the agency with expertise in the NEPA review, and the flip side of that -- and this is made explicit in the 2023 amendments -- is that where the first NEPA review answers these questions, the second agency can look back to the first NEPA review and say we're all done here.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWe don't need another one.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, can I just give you a chance to answer what I think is the hardest part for you? And that is, if -- if the environmental impacts come from the cargo that is to be carried on these trains and the Board cannot, because of the common carrier mandate, really consider the cargo or discriminate on the basis of the cargo, then how is it that these environmental impacts are useful to the Board's decision-making in the way that NEPA requires?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo there -- as we -- as we've been discussing, there are three sets of -- three general sets of impacts.\n\nAnd I don't think that, for example, the wildfire set of impacts on the -- along the downline stretch, I don't think that's driven by the cargo, so let's bracket that for the moment. I think that in many cases, where you're building a railroad and the railroad will carry whatever -- whatever all comers want, whether it's passengers or freight, then the Board would be justified in saying this is a -- you know, this is a common carrier line.\n\nIt would be totally speculative to ask what cargo it will carry. In this case, it's not speculative at all because the entire purpose is to carry one set of cargo.\n\nAnd if you look at the -- at the record, you will see that --\n\nJudge:\nWould the Board be justified in saying we know what this cargo is, and because we can't discriminate on the basis of our common carrier mandate, there's no impact on our decision with respect to NEPA or whatever, and so, therefore, we don't have to study it?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo I think probably in the context of a project like this one, where the Board's mission is to weigh the transportation merits against the environmental consequences and the transportation merits are heavily weighted with the oil and gas -- the oil development in the basin, the economic value that it will create, and the -- the ability to unlock this important natural resource, we're -- we're -- we're not saying that the Board would conclude that the environmental consequences are too grave to -- to permit the railway as a matter of law or something like that. But we are saying that what environmental consequences would result foreseeably from carrying one cargo to particular destinations in very large quantities, that's foreseeable, whereas, as the Board said about the other things that -- that might go along on this rail line, we don't know what they might be.\n\nIt would be speculative -- it would be speculative to wonder what they might be, but we do know that there will be no trains carrying anything else -- let me say that more precisely.\n\nThere will be no trains carrying cargo other than oil and only cargo other than oil.\n\nEvery train leaving this basin is going to be carrying waxy crude oil.\n\nThere might be a little, you know -- one car tacked -- tacked on for something else if there were a -- a market for it. And so, under those circumstances where the rationale for the project is to permit unlocking more waxy crude oil development and where the -- where the Board's consideration of the benefits of the project is tied to the -- that oil development, it -- it follows that the Board would at least consider what the environmental consequences of doing so would be.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel. Justice, any questions?\n\nJudge:\nI do see that there are different questions here.\n\nYou mentioned the train accidents and the wildfire or pollution.\n\nNo one's ever -- I don't think Petitioner has ever said the agency should not study those things.\n\nThose are directly caused by the train, the project.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nOpposing counsel said that this morning, that it's --\n\nJudge:\nExactly.\n\nAnd so, really --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- you know, it's 88 -- outside the 88 miles.\n\nJudge:\n-- that's a different challenge as to whether they did it adequately or not, which is what the D.C.

This Court said that in Woodford versus Ngo.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is everything that the case --the case isn't proceeding.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when it does proceed, if there is no collateral estoppel effect, preclusion isn't barring the -- the jury from performing full on their fact-finding role.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what -- that is what the Seventh Amendment preserves and only what the Seventh Amendment preserves.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, historically --\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Gorsuch?\r\n\r\nJudge: So, if -- if it were impossible to re-file, exhaustion not possible, would that change the analysis?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: Because then there would be preclusion effectively by the district --by the magistrate judge's order, wouldn't there?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If for those prisoners that can't come back because there has been either a dismissal with prejudice or because their -- their prison system doesn't allow for any -- any kind of leeway, any discretion, for those prisoners, there still is not a violation of a Seventh Amendment right.\r\n\r\nLooking back historically, there is no Seventh Amendment right to be preserved and --\r\n\r\nJudge: So there's -- so preclusion really has nothing to do with it then on your theory.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It --it has something to do with the inquiry for those prisoners that can come back because --\r\n\r\nJudge: I'm asking about those who can't.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: For those --\r\n\r\nJudge: You said same result --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- despite preclusion.\r\n\r\nSo something else has to be doing the work.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: What -- what --\r\n\r\nJudge: What is that something else?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: What's doing the work for the prisoners that can't come back is that their claims --they have not met the exhaustion requirements that Congress set forth.\r\n\r\nCongress can set forth what they have to prove in front of a jury, and Congress likewise can set forth what they have to meet in order --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, now that's interesting.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: --to get their claims --\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nSo that's essentially saying Congress can choose to get rid of the jury.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought just last term, in Jarkesy, where Congress expressly said no jury trial right, and we said no.\r\n\r\nWe said nice policy you have there.\r\n\r\nWe've got the Seventh Amendment here.\r\n\r\nNo good.\r\n\r\nNow why would we interpret the PLRA, which is silent about juries, to have a rule that you never get a jury? That -- I agree, I think that has to be your argument.\r\n\r\nIt can't be this exhaustion thing because you want the same rule whether they're precluded or not precluded.

Mr. McDowell.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court. On the first question presented, the 30-day filing deadline in Section 1252(b)(1) is not jurisdictional.\n\nThat provision fails this Court's clear statement test, and Stone is not a binding jurisdictional ruling.\n\nOn the second question, the petition here was timely because it was filed within 30 days of the Board's CAT order.\n\nIn Section 1252(a)(4), Congress provided for judicial review of CAT claims, and precedent confirms that courts may review CAT orders together with removal orders.\n\nIt follows that a CAT order becomes final at the same time as a removal order so that challenges to both orders can be raised together in the same petition for review.\n\nUnder amicus's position, many CAT claims would be unreviewable, but when Congress wanted to preclude judicial review in the INA, it did so expressly.\n\nIt is unlikely that Congress would have precluded review of many claims indirectly by way of a generic 30-day filing deadline.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Can you give us an example of an instance in which a claim, claim B can be considered with -- or appeal B can be considered with appeal A, but appeal B actually expands the time limit for appeal A?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think the best analogy is the one that was pointed to, which is that a conviction cannot be appealed until after the sentence, even though the sentence doesn't affect the validity of the conviction or merge into the conviction.\n\nAnd --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nLet's try the civil context.\n\nCan you think of any other provision?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I suppose there the way it would work in a -- in a remedial scheme, a remedial decision as opposed to a liability decision, the -- the remedial decision wouldn't affect the liability decision, but we would still under the final judgment principle not allow an appeal of the liability ruling until after the remedial decision is done.\n\nAnd I think the same basic logic applies here, because as precedent points out, a CAT order does not affect the validity of a removal order, but our position is that the removal order doesn't become final until the end of CAT proceedings because that's when the agency has finished its work on the case and disassociated itself from the case, which is the basic final judgment principle that always applies in judicial review in the courts of appeals.\n\nJudge: Mr. McDowell, can you give us some examples of -- you say that adopting amicus's view would leave certain CAT orders unreviewable.\n\nCan you give us some examples?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I think under his position, I think the CAT order in this case would be unreviewable because Petitioner didn't file the petition for review within 30 days of the Section 1228 removal.\n\nJudge: I think your friend, though, in this case would say, well, he could have done.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So our point is that if you're referring to the premature protective petition scheme idea, I think that that -- there are two potential legal problems there.\n\nOne is the zipper clause, which contemplates a single petition for review at the end of the case; whereas the premature filing of a petition supplemented by a later filing related to the CAT claim, I think, runs counter to that idea. I also think that if the Court were to adopt amicus's reading of the statute, one potential upshot of that is that Congress intended to foreclose review of these claims. And if Congress wanted to foreclose review of these claims, we don't see how courts and litigants could adopt a work-around scheme to get around that.\n\nBut obviously our front-line position is that Congress did want review of these claims.\n\nJudge: I think your friend on the other side would say, well, they can file these protective appeals and courts of appeals can hold onto them and -- and then when the CAT order matures, you're good to go.\n\nWould courts of appeals have to keep those notices of appeal on their docket? Could they --could they -- is there a risk they might dismiss them? I'm just not sure -- I -- I've not held a notice of appeal on my docket as an appellate court judge on the Tenth Circuit for, what, a year, two years while the CAT order is ongoing.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And I think that's --\n\nJudge: I just don't know. I haven't encountered that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think this points up another problem with this idea, which is that I don't actually think it's a particularly effective way of preserving judicial review because these procedures lie within the discretion of the courts of appeals.\n\nAnd so some courts of appeals may deny a motion to hold a case in abeyance.\n\nSo I think we would end up with a patchwork system where some circuits are generally preserving review of these claims; others are not.\n\nAnd there might be even variation within circuits.\n\nWe also see some other practical problems with the system.\n\nOne is that it leads to a flood of meritless prophylactic petitions which really aren't challenging the removal order itself.\n\nThey're just a placeholder for a later decision that may actually go in the alien's favor.\n\nThe second problem is that it creates a trap for the unwary because many people in this system are unrepresented and won't know that they have to file this sort of counterintuitive protective petition.\n\nAnd then, finally, it does create administrative burdens for the courts and for the government.\n\nAnd what we've seen in practice is that many of these protective petitions end up being abandoned at the end of the day because the person gets withholding relief or because they just don't want to pursue the petition.\n\nSo it really is just a waste of resources in many cases.\n\nJudge: Could I speculate and say you're right, if we accept amicus's argument, basically CAT orders won't be reviewable because -- in those places where the courts don't want to stay the appeal of a petition for removal.\n\nThat would happen for aggravated felons, and some people might say, well, that's a good thing.\n\nCongress didn't want them to delay deportation any longer than necessary.\n\nSo I could see some people saying. Don't worry about those guys.\n\nOkay. But doesn't the Board in a fairly significant number of regular asylum cases, regular petitions for removal where the person's not an aggravated felon or someone else who's done something other than be here illegally, doesn't the Board often split those decisions?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It does --\n\nJudge: And --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It does, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So it affirms the petition for removal.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: But it remands.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's correct.\n\nJudge: For the CAT claims.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\n\nJudge: And under amici's position, those people who are not aggravated felons, those people then are deprived totally of the zipper clause, correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "712", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWell, Mr. Unikowsky's argument as I understand it is that the exhaustion rules in Alabama make it impossible for him to pursue the due process claims that he has under 1983.\n\nSo would you respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nTwo points.\n\nOne, as Justice Gorsuch was alluding to, that is a new argument that was not presented to the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\nIt was not passed upon by the Alabama Supreme Court. It's not in the cert petition, and it's not properly before this Court.\n\nTheir only argument is that even the most perfect agency adjudication, if it has an exhaustion rule, is preempted.\n\nAnd we think that, as Justice Kagan was alluding to with Felder, that that rule has already been rejected by this Court.\n\nBut looking at this as-applied challenge to Alabama's law, we don't think that it is the case that it functions as an immunity. Mandamus is still available.\n\nThere is still the potential for a futility argument, one that was not raised below.\n\nAnd so it's simply not the case that it is impossible to get an adjudication here.\n\nJudge:\nI'm not sure how it is possible given that, as I read the court's decision below, you have to bring the due process argument to the agency, and I don't see any procedure to do that within the agency.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, Your Honor --\n\nJudge:\nThere's nothing that -- there's no mandamus within the agency. I don't know how the mandamus court would have jurisdiction because it requires exhaustion.\n\nSo you're in a loop that I'm not sure how this claimant gets out of.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, I don't think mandamus would require exhaustion.\n\nThe point of mandamus would be to break the sort of logjam that Plaintiffs are complaining about here, but they didn't take advantage of mandamus.\n\nJudge:\nWell, Alabama -- Alabama ruled very broadly.\n\nIt didn't say that Mr. Williams, for example, who had a final judgment that he was attacking, had a claim that could be heard in court.\n\nAnd you seem to concede in your briefs that he did.\n\nHe got his claim thrown out because he didn't file a notice of claim.\n\nThen he brought a due process argument saying that the notice he received was inadequate or the time limits were not proper under due process.\n\nAnd the Alabama court dismissed his action as unexhausted.\n\nThat sounds to me as if the due process claim has to be exhausted within the agency.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, Your Honor, if -- if he had exhausted it and it was final, he had the ability to file a direct appeal to the circuit court.\n\nJudge:\nHe did.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo, Your Honor --\n\nJudge:\nAnd the court -- he did.\n\nThe court did what it did.\n\nAnd, all of a sudden, he goes up to the Alabama Supreme Court and it dismisses it as unexhausted.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, I think it's important to remember how this was actually litigated before the state courts.\n\nTheir primary argument, if you go back to their briefs before the state courts, was that this exhaustion requirement didn't apply to sort of procedural challenges whatsoever.\n\nThere was no 1983 claim --\n\nJudge:\nWell, please just tell me what form -- where is it in this process that tells litigants, if we're not acting, you can go to the appeals council and file something and get them to order the agency to do something, and then, if the agency doesn't do it, maybe you've exhausted and you have a futility argument to go seek mandamus or to go do something in state court.\n\nThis is a Kafkaesque type of process that's going on here.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, I don't think so.\n\nAlabama case law makes clear that mandamus is available and that you may be able to raise futility arguments.\n\nJudge:\nIt's discretionary mandamus, isn't it?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nCorrect, but we -- we presume that state courts --\n\nJudge:\nAnd I don't know how --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- are going to follow the federal Constitution.\n\nJudge:\n-- I actually don't know how mandamus operates with respect to the exhaustion requirement.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, and that just points out the waiver problems that I was addressing earlier.\n\nNone of this was briefed up below.\n\nNone of this was argued in the blue brief either.\n\nAnd so what we are dealing with here is this categorical rule.\n\nAnd we don't think that even Patsy supports this categorical rule.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWell, General, on -- on that question, you started the day but with the -- the text of federal law does not preempt, you know, and that's a fair argument and a good argument.\n\nIt's just the argument that was in the dissent in Felder.\n\nJustice O'Connor made exactly those same points, but it was a dissent in Felder.\n\nAnd in the majority in Felder, it made clear that the exhaustion requirement by Wisconsin's law was problematic. It said it \"doesn't involve lengthy or expensive administrative proceedings, but it forces injured persons to seek satisfaction from those alleged to have caused the injury in the first place.\n\nSuch a dispute resolution system may have much to commend it, but that is a judgment the current Congress must make.\" In other words, the language in Felder does seem -- contra Justice O'Connor's dissent, the language in the majority in Felder does seem to suggest that exhaustion requirements generally -- and we can talk about how to define those -- but generally are preempted even though there's no text.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, a few things on that point, Your Honor.\n\nFirst is Felder did not just say Patsy ruled and then, in a two-page opinion, end the case.\n\nThere was a detailed, nearly 15-page preemption analysis there.\n\nAnd the Court made clear there were really two key problems with the Wisconsin law.\n\nOne was that, in purpose and effect, it minimized liability.\n\nAnd so there's your clear conflict.\n\nYou have a federal law designed to impose liability and a state law designed to minimize it.\n\nI think that is the through line from Felder to Howlett to Haywood, is those are immunity laws.\n\nAnd, second, the Court said that the law in Wisconsin frequently and predictably defeated the 1983 claim.\n\nNow \"defeat\" means that you're going to exercise jurisdiction over it and then dismiss it with prejudice because it is an affirmative defense that the defendants were handed by Wisconsin, and that did result in dismissals with prejudice.\n\nJurisdiction -- like the law at issue in Alabama, jurisdiction's not an affirmative defense.\n\nYou would never say that an amount in controversy requirement is an affirmative defense.\n\nAnd it doesn't defeat the right.\n\nIt simply says we're not going to consider it.\n\nAnd so there's no way for Alabama to alter the 1983 right by merely --\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "754", "dialogue": "Judge: I have a problem, which is I think I don't have to go as far as my colleague. You could continue what you're doing. We have two prior decisions telling the government a notice to appear is inadequate if it doesn't have the time and place. Despite that, and despite the fact that there's ample proof that it can be done, it hasn't been done. It continues to issue these TBA notices to appear. If we rule in your favor, we're giving you an incentive to continue that practice because you can do it continuously. You don't have to pay any attention to the statute. You can continue doing TBAs and continue your practice. As my colleague said, those people who show up, you give them a compliant one when they show up. Those people who don't, you remove them in absentia, and they can't ever come back and complain about your process. That's really the incentive here.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, I have two responses to that. First, I want to talk a little bit about our current practices. We have made very significant progress in the years since the prior rulings in reducing the number of TBD NTAs that are still issued. There are technological and operational reasons why we're not down to zero yet, and I'm happy to talk about those if Your Honor is interested. But I do want to assure the Court that we take very seriously the obligation to comply with this Court's decisions and to comply with the statute. The bigger problem is, assuming we could issue NTAs that had time and date information going forward, it does not do anything about the hundreds of thousands of cases that have already been closed where removal orders were already issued—\n\nJudge: So let's go to the practical problems. You started by saying there's an entitlement to reopen. There isn't. It is the right to make a motion to reopen, but it's still discretionary for the Board of Immigration Appeals to decide whether to reopen. Is that correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is the way that we read the statute. That's not the way that some courts, in particular, the Ninth Circuit, have read the statute. They have suggested that if a non-citizen files a motion and they can prove that they got the defective NTA—\n\nJudge: Well, that's a separate legal issue. The way the statute is written, it is not mandatory to reopen. They can take into account what happened in one of these three cases where a litigant showed up. And I don't know, did you forfeit that argument in—was that the last case that's before us, the Mendez-Colin case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In the Mendez-Colin argument?\n\nJudge: Yes. He showed up a number of times and then left, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct, and we did not make a specific waiver or forfeiture argument if that's what Your Honor is referring to.\n\nJudge: That—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We highlighted the facts of his case for two reasons. The first is because it shows—\n\nJudge: But you could have made that argument?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I suppose we could have, Your Honor. But it wouldn't, I think, address some of the problems with the other side's position, in particular—\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —the other side's—\n\nJudge: If you had raised that argument, do you have any doubt the Board of Immigration Appeals would have said you forfeited because you had notice of these proceedings and your rights and the time and place?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there are two problems with relying on waiver or forfeiture in this context. The first is it still allows these motions to be filed. And if even some significant fraction of the hundreds of thousands of old in absentia orders are injected back into the immigration system, that could have a very significant impact on a system that is already dealing with a backlog of 3 million cases. The second problem is that waiver or forfeiture actually heightens the perverse incentives that the non-citizens’ rule creates. Mendez-Colin would have been better off just never showing up. And so their rule creates a circumstance where non-citizens are encouraged to flout the rules of the removal process by failing to appear.\n\nJudge: But if you comply with the statute, they won't be in that position. This is about past people who have already chosen to abscond after they know about hearings. They can't unring the bell.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And that's our significant concern, Your Honor. There are a huge number of these past people who have gotten in absentia orders after failing to appear, and we don't have any way to remedy that going forward. And if the Ninth Circuit's rule stands—\n\nJudge: I mean, I appreciate the force of the point, Counsel, but there are so many people because the government was out of compliance with this statute for so long. And so, at a certain point, it's just—you can't sort of ask us to read the statute against what the statute says because we've created a world in which kind of we've long since forgotten what the statute says.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, respectfully, Your Honor, that's not what we're asking. We're asking you to apply the statute as it's written, and that is a statute that permits in absentia removal when a non-citizen received notice under either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2). And all the non-citizens here got the paragraph (2) notice. They haven't contested that they received notice of when and where to show up.\n\nJudge: I think that's what most fundamentally I find a little bit discomfiting about your argument, this idea that there are two forms of notice, take your pick. If one is good, who cares about the other? I mean, it seems to me that if you read the statute fairly, it's quite clear—and this is what we said in our two prior cases—you know, (a)(1) is the notice. That's the notice. And what (a)(2)—it tells you what you have to put in it, all the things that you have to do. Here are the charges. Here is your right to counsel. And here is when you're supposed to show up. And what (a)(2) is about is Congress understood that there were going to be times when you were told to show up on March 15th and then it turned out that March 15th was impracticable or impossible for any of a number of reasons, and it was a mechanism to say, okay, we don't mean March 15th; instead, show up on August 15th. But that's what the function of (a)(2) is. It's not some completely distinct form of notice that you can say, hey, look, we did that one.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "500", "dialogue": "Judge: So you're saying, in other words, that your view— I just want to make sure I understand it—doesn't affect any other limitation; it just interprets the word \"accrual\"?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Is that a fair summary of it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's— that's— it's— it's an— it's an application of an accrual statute.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And, again, this Court dealt with that in Darby versus Cisneros.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: If— if I could go back, counsel, to what you suggested about accrual would operate the same way in an action where there was an as-applied defense in an enforcement action, you know, I don't think it could. 2401(a) just talks about civil actions commenced against the United States. It has no application to—to—to places where there's an enforcement action and this functions as a defense.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So there are different types of contexts for as-applied. If—if—if you are denied a permit, for example, you usually take that to court in—in federal district court and you sue the United States. And so, on its face, 2401 would apply in that context.\n\nJudge: So the distinction there is between an enforcement action against you by the government, in which case you'd have the ability to—to—to make your challenges, but, if you sought an as-applied challenge affirmatively yourself, you might be barred? Is that—is that—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that's right.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I just want to—I just want to point out what the government is asking for is—is several carveouts. It's asking for a carveout for how general accrual rules have had—have worked since the 1830s. It's asking for a carveout for how this Court has actually interpreted the phrase \"first accrues\" from Gabelli. It's actually asking for a carveout of how this Court has applied 2401 in the past. We think Crown Coat supports us, but the Court had applied 2401's predecessors in the 1900s. The Chamber brief outlines several examples where—where—where \"first accrues\" is applied just how we want. And—and so what the government is asking for is a special rule just for it. And this Court rejected the special—that exact same argument in the Franconia case when it was leading—\n\nJudge: What do you do with the \"first\" in the actual statute? I mean, you seem to be asking us to read the statute as if it says a complaint is barred from the time in which the plaintiff is first aggrieved. But that's not what it says. So how is it that every new company that is created in the aftermath of the creation of a rule can claim that this is the first time that the cause of action has arisen under the APA?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Because, under accrual-based statutes, the—the—the—the claim is plaintiff-specific. So, if you look at, like, the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act—\n\nJudge: All right. But you're just assuming away the question at the beginning by saying this is an accrual-based statute. What I'm suggesting is that it's not. Just because it says the cause of action accrues doesn't make it an accrual-based statute in the way that you are interpreting, and I don't understand how it can be when it says \"first accrues.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So the way we interpret \"first accrues\" is that the first time you suffer a harm, that is when your statute of limitations starts running.\n\nJudge: Right. But isn't that reading words into the statute in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense? You're suggesting that this statute is the first time anybody is harmed by the United States, they have six years, anybody, for any reason.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's how 2401 reads and is applied. And to be clear, it applies to not just APA claims. It applies to FOIA actions. It applies to government decisions that are not—that are not covered by Title VII. And the government's rule doesn't make sense in those contexts. You can imagine an agency that had an unlawful employment policy, and under the government's rule, the first employee that was harmed by that policy, that would start the statute of limitations for everybody at the same time, including—\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?\n\nJudge: The government says that late-arising objectors like Corner Post can get relief by petitioning for a new rulemaking. Why isn't that sufficient for you?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So we don't think that's a—a—a—a—a viable path to judicial review for a couple reasons. First, the government gets to decide when it rules on a petition for rulemaking, and it can sit on it for years. But even the government acknowledged I think in PDR Network that this is not a guaranteed path to judicial review. Typically, a denial of a petition for rulemaking gets very deferential review that doesn't allow the—the plaintiff to actually get at the merits of the underlying regulation they're trying to—they're trying to—trying to challenge. And—and—and—and we know what would have happened in this case if we filed a petition for review. The—the Board itself issued a—a—an NPRM after we—after the Court granted cert and is not going to revisit the part of the rule that we want it to revisit, and so it wouldn't have mattered even if we did.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch, any—Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJudge: Just so I'm clear on the earlier questions, in an as-applied enforcement action against you, I think you and the government agree that you can always raise a legal challenge to the—the rule or the regulation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's correct. That's—that's how lower courts have interpreted it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Second question, and this is looking down the road and is really a tangential issue, but it interests me. So what relief can you get here—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So in—in—\n\nJudge: —if you can't get vacatur of the rule?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If we can't get vacatur? We—we can't imagine a situation where our client can get relief from this rule absent vacatur.

{"id": "504", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 24-656, TikTok versus Garland, and the consolidated case. Lawyer of Defendant.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, and may it please the Court: Under the Act, one of America's most popular speech platforms will shut down in nine days.\n\nThat shouldn't happen for three reasons.\n\nFirst, TikTok incorporated as a U.S. company speaking in the United States.\n\nThe Act requires it to go dark unless ByteDance executes a qualified divestiture.\n\nWhether you call that a ban or a divestiture, one thing is clear: It's a burden on TikTok's speech, so the First Amendment applies.\n\nSecond, the Act is content-based from beginning to end.\n\nIt applies only to social media platforms that have user-generated content, except for business, product, and travel reviews.\n\nWithin that content-based universe, it singles out a single speaker for uniquely harsh treatment, and it does so because the government fears that China could, in the future, indirectly pressure TikTok to disseminate foreign misinformation and propaganda.\n\nFinally, the Act can't satisfy any standard of scrutiny.\n\nThe government has no valid interest in preventing foreign propaganda. And its fallback that it seeks merely to prevent covertness makes no sense since that could be addressed with a risk disclosure.\n\nThe government's real target, rather, is the speech itself, its fear that Americans, even if fully informed, could be persuaded by Chinese misinformation.\n\nThat, however, is a decision that the First Amendment leaves to the people.\n\nGiven that, the government's data security rationale cannot independently sustain the Act.\n\nIt is also grossly under-inclusive and ignores the most obvious less restrictive alternative: simply banning TikTok, Incorporated, from sharing any sensitive user data with anyone.\n\nIn short, this Act should not stand. At a minimum, you should preliminarily enjoin it, which will allow you to carefully consider this momentous issue and, for the reasons explained by the President-Elect, potentially moot the case.\n\nI welcome your questions.\n\nJudge: Exactly what is TikTok's speech here?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: TikTok, Your Honor, uses an algorithm that, in its view, reflects the best mix of content.\n\nWhat the Act does is it says TikTok cannot do that unless ByteDance executes a qualified divestiture.\n\nThat's a direct burden on TikTok's speech, much less of a burden than the one that this Court struck down in the Simon & Schuster case, where all the author had to do was take a certain amount of proceeds and put it into an escrow account for a short period of time to satisfy a civil judgment.\n\nJudge: So why does a restriction on ByteDance, which is not a citizen, is not located in the U.S., a restriction on TikTok?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because what the law says to TikTok is that, TikTok, you cannot use the algorithm that you prefer to use unless ByteDance executes a qualified divestiture.\n\nSo the law, therefore, falls directly on TikTok itself.\n\nIt imposes a burden on TikTok's speech, again, a much more significant burden than the one that was struck down in Simon & Schuster.\n\nThere --\n\nJudge: So you're converting the restriction on ByteDance's ownership of the algorithm and the company into a restriction on TikTok's speech.\n\nSo why can't we simply look at it as a restriction on ByteDance?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because I think the burden falls directly on TikTok.\n\nAnd I can use a hypothetical that helps illustrate the point.\n\nSuppose that China used its leverage over a media owner's international empire, including their Chinese businesses, to force a major U.S. newspaper to write whatever China wanted on the front page.\n\nSurely, the government couldn't come in and say, you need to either sell the newspaper or shut it down.\n\nThat wouldn't just violate the owner's First Amendment rights.\n\nThat would also violate the newspaper’s First Amendment rights because they are ultimately the one that's suffering the burden under that law because they have to go dark and close up their books.\n\nJudge: Counsel, you began by saying this is a U.S. company operating in the United States.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: But the ultimate company that controls it, ByteDance, was found by Congress -- and I'll quote this -- \"to be subject to Chinese laws that require it to assist or cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work\" and to ensure that the Chinese government has the power to access and control private data that the company holds.\n\nSo are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, Your Honor, I don't think you are supposed to ignore that at all, but I also don't think that it changes the analysis for a couple of reasons.\n\nLook, TikTok --\n\nJudge: Well, just hold on a second.\n\nWell, as I said, you began by saying this is a U.S. company operating in the United States.\n\nAnd it seems to me that you're ignoring the major concern here of Congress, which was Chinese manipulation of the content and acquisition and harvesting of the content.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\n\nAnd I'll start by saying that TikTok, Incorporated, is a United States subsidiary operating in the United States with its own set of free speech rights.\n\nI --\n\nJudge: Do you dispute the fact that ByteDance has ultimate control of TikTok in its corporate organization?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Your Honor, I do dispute that, but I also don't think that it matters because, even if China could exercise overwhelming power against TikTok versus ByteDance, I don't think it would change the analysis.\n\nAnd I can take that newspaper hypothetical and ratchet it up a little bit to help illustrate the point.\n\nLet's suppose that the Chinese government had actually taken the media owner's family hostage and it was using that leverage in order to force them to publish whatever they wanted.\n\nSo China effectively has total control.\n\nI still don't think that Congress could come in and tell them either sell the paper or shut it down because that would violate both the owner's and the newspaper's rights.\n\nMaybe what they could do is come in and say you need to disclose the fact that you're under this amount of coercion so that the people who are looking at the paper understand it and can make their own assessment.\n\nBut I think the First Amendment rights of both the owner and the newspaper would be directly implicated, notwithstanding that China, in that scenario, has effectively total control over what gets printed.\n\nJudge: Counsel, let me break this down.\n\nI understand your argument that there is a First Amendment right that the U.S. company has.\n\nI'll go that far with you, okay --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'll take it. (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: Because we're affecting their ability to talk in whatever way they choose.\n\nA newspaper could choose, without any influence or threat against its owner, to promote Chinese policy, and our First Amendment would permit them to do that if they chose it independently, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Now the question becomes -- so it's not -- that's just a given, that they have a First Amendment right.\n\nThe next question is, assuming they do, what's the level of scrutiny --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: -- we apply? Isn't that what the issue here is?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That is certainly one of the issues, Your Honor.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "705", "dialogue": "Judge: If the state wants to use his property for a railroad, it doesn't really matter that a person doesn't want to sell. The state has the ability to take—the only thing that the state does not have the prerogative to do and the thing that the landowner has a right to have is payment.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So to say, well, look, you can sue for an injunction, but you can't sue for payment just doesn't understand the nature of this right.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, so our first-line argument is, you know, the way the United States did it for a hundred years is correct. But if the Court disagrees with that, if the Court says, you know what, actually—\n\nJudge: So, General, I kind of agree with that. Your best argument is like what happened between the time of the Constitution and, you know, someplace in the late 19th century. But suppose that I'm not such an originalist and I don't really care about that.\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure. All right. So that's the answer I'm going to say. So, if a court says, we read First English and it requires not just substantive relief, it requires some sort of judicial proceeding, which we don't think is consistent with the history, but let's assume, Texas does it. Texas provides a cause of action for which they can bring a federal takings claim. So even if that is true, which we don't believe as our first-line argument is correct, Texas still wins. They—\n\nJudge: What if Texas didn't do it, though?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—so that's where we get interesting.\n\nJudge: But I'm not—and I just want to be clear—I'm not talking about the hypothetical you gave where Texas announces in advance—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —we're going to take and we're not going to pay. Let's say that Texas takes and just this one property owner can't get the money, Texas is being intransigent about it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: And Texas says: And, by the way, our state cause of action—we have no state cause of action for you to use in our courts to get the money, no private bills. We don't do that. There's no state—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: —law remedy. What then?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: All right. So, you know, if a state goes rogue, that's how we're thinking about it, because we know from Knick all the states don't do that, but let's assume some state says, we're just not going to do that. Well, you have injunctive relief. I realize that might not be a perfect relief—\n\nJudge: Doesn't work in this hypothetical.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It doesn't work because of that. Then the answer is exactly what the Constitution says. Congress—Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment says, if a state is violating the Constitution, which would be happening in this scenario, that's precisely what Section 5 is for. Congress has never done that—\n\nJudge: So they have to wait for Congress to enforce it through legislation? Would there be some sort of due process violation or an argument that the state has to provide some sort of forum?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, that's what I'm trying to say. If you read First English that way to say that not only is it there's a substantive obligation, but there has to be some sort of judicial forum for—for, you know, vindication of that—\n\nJudge: Not a judicial forum.

Sure.\n\nJudge: —your argument about that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Okay.\n\nJudge: You're—you're really saying that the state could shut down and give no administrative forum, no legislative forum, no judicial forum, and because the Fifth Amendment doesn't create an implied cause of action, then the property owner would have to say, Congress, can you please use your Section 5 power?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The answer would be first try to get an injunction.

{"id": "85", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay. So, if a willing buyer shows up—who owns the life insurance policy?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The company is entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance. And that is hugely important when you're applying this test because the fundamental problem with the government's view—our view is that 77 percent of $3.86 million is $3 million.\nThe government's view is that 77 percent of $6.86 million is $5.3 million.\nA willing buyer would never, at that moment, if buying Michael, the decedent's, shares, pay $5.3 million.\nWhy? Because a willing buyer would not be able to capture those life insurance proceeds by swooping in before the redemption.\nThose life insurance proceeds belong to the company.\n\nJudge: Well, the value has to go someplace. The 3 million goes someplace. Does it go into the value of the remaining stocks? And if it is there, why isn't the appropriate valuation 6.86 million?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The $3 million of the life insurance proceeds are used to redeem Michael's shares under the terms of the parties' agreement.\nNow, as a practical matter, the problem here and the fundamental issue that all of us are wrestling with is that what we know is that you can't use the $3 million as simply the valuation.\nWhy? Because, as I noted at the outset, we didn't satisfy the requirements of Section 2703.\nAnd, therefore, you have to engage in this counterfactual inquiry, and the problem with the counterfactual inquiry that the government wants this Court to engage in is, again, that it requires you to disregard the redemption obligation.\nNow it is true that one consequence of our interpretation is that, as to Thomas, the surviving stockholder, Thomas in some very real sense benefits from the increase in value by virtue of this transaction.\nWhy? Because Thomas goes from having 22 percent of the company to a hundred percent of the company.\nBut, under our approach, as under the government's approach, that is taken care of by the eventual application of the capital gains tax.\n\nWhat the government wants you to do is to effectively take those life insurance proceeds into account twice—once when calculating the estate tax because the government wants you to tax this higher amount, $5.3 million—and, again, no hypothetical willing buyer would ever have paid that.\n\nCrown would never have redeemed the shares for $5.3 million.\nAnd I'm happy to explain why.\n\nBut then the government also will subject Thomas eventually to the capital gains tax on the increase in the value of his shares. And that, in our view, is the fundamental problem with the government's approach here, and that is why this is effectively double taxation.\n\nAnd to just spell out for another sentence or two why the $5.3 million valuation—\n\nJudge: But, if I can just stop you there because it seems that the fundamental problem with your approach is that Thomas's asset has quadrupled in value, and it's quadrupled in value without him putting a single cent more into the company.\nAnd there might be some taxation effect in the end of all that, but—not sufficient to make up for the fact that it's a tell that your way of calculating the thing is wrong that somebody can come away with four times the value without putting a single cent into the company.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, with respect, I completely disagree with that, and let me explain why.\n\nIt is true that Thomas is in a very real sense practically the beneficiary of the life insurance proceeds.\nWhy? Because those proceeds extinguish the offsetting liability on the books, the offsetting redemption obligation.\nAnd so this is a context in which Thomas does come away with the benefit of those proceeds because he is the sole owner of a company that is worth $3.86 million.\n\nNow the government complains around the edges about the fact that it's the capital gains tax—the capital gains tax only operates upon realization, there is a stepped-up basis when someone dies and passes the stock along, and so forth.\nBut those are all features of the capital gains tax system.\nThat is not a bug with our position.\n\nAgain, our position is the rational one precisely because the tax system captures that increase.\nAnd, of course, under our approach, Michael's heir is still, of course, paying the estate tax.\nMichael's heir is paying the estate tax on stock at around $3 million, coincidentally roughly the amount that was contained in the buy-sell agreement, which I think confirms that that amount was a rational amount here.\n\nBut the problem with the $5.3 million, again, the government's view is—let's take Crown.\nThe government's view is presumably that if there had been a proper arm's-length agreement here, Crown would have been willing to pay $5.3 million to redeem this stock.\n\nThat would have required Crown to use all of the life insurance proceeds here, the entire $3.5 million, and also to dip into its operating assets in order to redeem those shares.\nThat illustrates why the government's position here is irrational.\n\nNow, to be sure, I think there is a—\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- conceptual --\n\nJudge: If Thomas had done what he needed to do, he would have—both owners would have insured each other.\nThey would have paid the price and gotten the shares.\nWhat you did was to off that to the corporation and give the corporation a benefit that entitled Thomas to own the company a hundred percent.\n\nI think that's where the question comes up.\nThe value of the company is the value at which someone's going to own a hundred percent shares of the stock.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, it wasn't—\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "539", "dialogue": "Judge: If I could contrast what -- the case that I just gave Justice Jackson, the Fifth Circuit decision in ABC, which goes through a long complaint and says at the end of it, a hundred pages, 14 confidential witnesses, all of that together doesn't actually state a claim because it's not particularized, and you match that up against the Ninth Circuit, it is, you know, as clear as day that these are two very different approaches. This Court in Twombly confronted a similar situation, and the district court dismissed a case for failing to state a claim.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: The Second Circuit reversed.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Stevens made exactly the arguments you are in dissent, and he said, look, you know, the law is as clear as day.\r\n\r\nBut this Court remand -- didn't just remand, it reversed and said the Second Circuit was wrong, we need to set a standard for the entire country to avoid lawsuits from going on.\r\n\r\nAnd I think Twombly is a very good example of how the Court's setting that rule matters. This Court has never defined particularity since the year 1926.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right, counsel --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: This case provides a good explanation.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- one last thing on your expert rule.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge: Your expert rule sounds very much like Justice Alito's concurrence.\r\n\r\nIs it?\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\r\n\r\nWe -- we don't -- we certainly don't have any objection to Justice Alito's concurrence in Tellabs, but we don't think, as our reply brief says, it matters here. So, Justice Sotomayor, you were talking about all the employees' statements.\r\n\r\nAll the employees' statements taken together never get to where they need to go, which is a strong inference that shows that --\r\n\r\nJudge: I'm -- I'm -- I'm totally dubious of that, but your other side can get you the factual argument on that because I've read through the allegations, and the employees were talking about constant sales reports that tracked every item that was being sold either to a gamer or to a cryptocurrency marketeer, and they were talking about the exact nature of the documents that were being created and the fact that there were many, many more sales than the 150 million that he was claiming.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: So -- so, Justice Sotomayor, with all respect, the district court went through allegation by allegation of these former employees and decimated each one, showing none of them were particularized.\r\n\r\nI understand what they've done is throw a bunch of spaghetti at the wall, and it's very hard for me in a half-hour argument to deal with that kind of shell game.\r\n\r\nJudge: Could we go to the --\r\n\r\nChief Justice: Counsel, one thing that concerns me about both sides' presentation, it's a little black and white.\r\n\r\nI gather you wouldn't be terribly upset about a complaint with a lot of direct evidence and, you know, some expert reports that sort of help shore that up.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm assuming the other side would be fine if -- if it -- you know, the balance was -- was the other way. Now, if I think that the positions on both sides are a little too absolute, how do you find sort of the sweet spot in terms of when the PSLRA is satisfied? I mean, it can't be just a little bit of direct evidence because that statute was intended to do something.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems to me you can't insist on only the direct evidence before a complaint goes forward. So, if -- if I don't think it's black and white, how do -- what -- how do I decide where the balance is?\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Mr. Chief Justice, you adopt the rule that's in our brief, which is not that you need direct evidence.\r\n\r\nCircumstantial evidence can do that just as well.\r\n\r\nIt's just got to be particularized, and at the end of the day, it's got to meet that Tellabs holistic inquiry of showing scienter is at least as cogent and compelling as not. So I think, at a minimum, it's going to require what specifically did the CEO know and when did he know it. This case is a perfect illustration.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence Justice Sotomayor is pointing to is from outside the class period, from before the class period.\r\n\r\nAs our brief explains, in May of 2017, which is the beginning of the class period, that's a watershed moment.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because, at that moment, the company introduces a crypto-specific chip, the Crypto SKU. And what their own complaint says -- the only time they allege an internal document is at Joint Appendix 59 to 62, and that document boomerangs on them.\r\n\r\nIt shows, once that new chip was introduced, crypto sales to -- to miners, to GPU sales, dropped dramatically, down to 27 percent from 62 percent. So the complaint essentially eats itself. This is why particularity is so important, why Congress insisted on it, that when questioned, because when they have a bunch of data -- a bunch of allegations from before May of 2017, that tells us nothing about after that.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of like looking at BlackBerry sales data before the introduction of the iPhone and saying, look, we can project BlackBerry sales after the iPhone's -- after the iPhone's introduction.\r\n\r\nOf course not. The whole thing the company was doing here, they were acknowledging that crypto miners were buying their products.\r\n\r\nThey said, look, we couldn't track exactly how much.\r\n\r\nThey introduced a whole product to deal with that.\r\n\r\nTheir allegation is this CEO lied and lied about the dependence on crypto. I mean, it's a really weird way to lie to say we're going to introduce a whole new product to deal specifically --\r\n\r\nJudge: But, Mr. --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- with this market.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- Mr. Katyal, your -- your description and your discussion and your argument sounds to me like summary judgment stage kind of discussion.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you -- you seem to be suggesting that this is the evidence that they have related to your, you know, client's misconduct and it's not enough. And I would appreciate that if we were at the summary judgment stage.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is, at the pleading stage, the allegations being made, how you are saying what I understood your rule to be as stated in your question presented is there the contents of the documents have to be alleged with particularity.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm still stuck on that as a -- the only way in which a plaintiff can sufficiently allege scienter in this kind of circumstance.\r\n\r\nI don't know why that is.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\r\n\r", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "587", "dialogue": "Judge: General, both the opposing counsel and I think one of the other judge's questions suggest that, well, you might have the ability to say that each one of these features has a historical precedent, but that there's something special about the combination of all of them, and that you can't point to a historical precedent which has every single feature that this scheme has.\n\nAnd you said to the other judge that the Customs Department comes awfully close, but I want you to step back a little bit and just talk to me about, you know, how should we be thinking about that question?\n\nIs it more important that all the parts have been used, or is it more important that the entire thing has an exact precedent? Is part of the lesson of history here that there's been enormous variation in the kinds of appropriations that Congress has made? How should we think about that feature of our history? Take it away.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think it is absolutely correct to say that there has been enormous variation in how Congress has exercised its appropriations power over the course of history.\n\nObviously, with respect to each of these challenged features, we think we have a wealth of evidence regarding standing appropriations or appropriations up to a particular cap. But I don't want to lose sight of the fact that if the Court were to approach this issue looking at the combination of features, this is not novel.\n\nAnd I want to try to unpack a little bit why that's so, because the other judge had asked me a couple of questions about the source of the funding and, in particular, about the idea that maybe the line that got crossed here or the relevant difference in how the agency is funded is because it draws its funds from the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nAnd I think the reason why that doesn't work and why it shows that this is not unprecedented is that the whole theory behind that premise is that that's a constraint on other agencies. Market forces will limit the overall pot of funding the other agencies have. But that's not accurate as a descriptive matter with respect to things like the Federal Reserve Board itself, which regulates and assesses money on the Federal Reserve Banks required to stay in the system. They can't leave.\n\nAnd if the overall value here is to determine whether the agency has some limiting check on the overall amount of funds, this agency is far more constricted because it has a statutory cap actually imposed by Congress rather than regulated entities.\n\nAnd I think, if the Court is looking at all of the features together, maybe some things subtract out Congress a little bit, but the cap adds in Congress in a very powerful and major way that I think distinguishes this appropriation for purposes of congressional control.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "753", "dialogue": "Judge: So I'm a little—trying to understand the government's argument about fundamental rights and the way in which Mandel works. In your colloquy with another judge, I think you said that there is not a fundamental right to have her spouse live with her in the United States, and that's sort of—that's the government's framing and the way in which you are approaching the first question. Is that—am I wrong about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would—I’d phrase it slightly different, that there is no liberty interest in getting your spouse admitted into the United States, notwithstanding immigration law restrictions.\n\nJudge: All right. But as—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, she has a liberty interest in living in the United States and in living with her spouse, but we don’t think that that is a—a liberty interest that allows her to overcome immigration determinations.\n\nJudge: No, I understand that, but I’m just trying to see how your argument maps onto what the Court actually did in Mandel. And as I read that case, as I look at it, the first thing they're asking is whether these professors had some sort of right to receive information and ideas as protected under the First Amendment. They weren't saying at the level that you're saying now do they have a right to have this particular person—or do they have a liberty interest in having this individual come to the United States as their first question.\n\nIt looks as though the way this opinion is structured, the Court starts off by saying, in a variety of contexts, this Court has referred to a First Amendment right to receive information and ideas, and then it goes on and talks about that. And then it gets to the point that you're talking about when it says, \"Recognition that First Amendment rights are implicated, however, is not dispositive of our inquiry.\" And then it goes on to do the rest of the inquiry.\n\nSo I think the parallel structure here would be the recognition that there is, as we’ve said in so many cases, a fundamental right to marriage, to include cohabitation, to raising your family. Those things exist. And that's implicated by the government's decision not to allow a person to come in—the spouse to come into the United States. And then you go on to determine whether or not, even though you have this right that's implicated, the other aspects of the test.\n\nWhat’s—what’s wrong with thinking about it that way? Because I—I hear you shifting the fundamental right at the beginning in answer to the question.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I think that’s in part because this is a due process case and not a First Amendment case, and so the Court is looking for a liberty or property interest that is directly impinged by—\n\nJudge: All right. And have you—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The government's action here. And—and precedent tells us that the fact that it is directed at a third party—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —is a distinction for due process purposes.\n\nJudge: But there was no underlying interest in that precedent. I mean, didn’t we say there was no right to live in the nursing home of your choice? Whereas we have recognized the fundamental right to marriage and raising a family and that kind of thing. So I think that precedent might be a little bit off in that way.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, but, I—I mean, I don’t think that that analysis carries the day here because the Court would—would never apply that analysis for purposes of the removal proceeding or any of the other proceedings here. The—The Court would not say that she has a due process right to participate in her husband’s removal proceeding because it might take him out of the country.\n\nAnd so the—the fact that there—there is this long tradition of no judicial review of these types of decisions about what noncitizens will be admitted into the country, we think, creates a high bar here and that—\n\nJudge: So you’re saying there’s no—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —there needs to be a specific liberty interest that is directly affected. And we don’t think that it’s a—a—a liberty interest that’s just in getting information or an explanation. We think it would be a liberty interest in actually having him in the United States.\n\nJudge: So is it your position that there isn’t a liberty interest in—it has to be more specific than the liberty interest in cohabitation with your spouse to begin with that would then trigger some sort of due process in this situation, and whether or not the government is satisfied, that is another question?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. Ultimately, this—the point here is that being able to live with your spouse in the United States is not the same thing as being able to get your spouse admitted to the United States.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lee.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over eight years ago, the government violated my client’s right to procedural due process by denying her husband's visa without providing a reason why. My client has a constitutional liberty interest in living with her husband.\n\nWe do not claim that this interest gives her the right to immigrate her husband regardless of his inadmissibility, but the importance of cohabitation to marriage means that the government is required to provide procedural protections when it burdens the underlying right.\n\nThe statute also informs what process is required. There’s nothing unusual about this. When government action burdens a substantive right, the Court often relies on procedural protections to balance the implications of that burden against the government's countervailing interest.\n\nThe statute likewise here shows why my client was herself deprived of that liberty interest and undermines the government’s argument that she was a mere bystander.\n\nUnder the immigration law, the citizen petitioner must initiate and advance her spouse’s application from start to finish, and the very purpose of the consular process for spouses is to benefit the American citizen spouse. Given this interest, judicial review is required.\n\nThis Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens can be implicated by visa denials, and when they are, that review is necessary.\n\nProcedural due process, therefore, requires notice sufficient to allow a meaningful opportunity to respond. A mere citation to a broad statute that encompasses any other unlawful activity forced my client to guess at the reason for the denial and provided only a mere gesture at due process, which this Court said was insufficient in a prior case.\n\nThe information my client ultimately learned came after the one-year deadline to respond had passed and after the government had informed them that its inadmissibility finding was permanent.\n\nWe now ask that my client be given the chance to respond to that information now.\n\nAnd I welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lee, I know others may want to talk about a prior case, but we confronted this liberty interest in another case, and I can’t think of any decision from this Court that said that such a liberty interest actually exists. Would you give your best account of how you get to this liberty interest?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes. So there is a liberty interest in marital cohabitation which arises under the Constitution. This is something which the Court has addressed in multiple occasions in the past.\n\nIn a prior case, for example, cohabitation was at the very heart of that case. That was a couple that was married in Washington, D.C., and the anti-miscegenation statute in the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibited them from living together as man and wife. The state court of appeals there said that the—\n\nJudge: I understand that. That’s a different case.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Defendant's Lawyer.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiff does not face an imminent injury from the absence of accessibility information at the website of a hotel she has no interest in visiting.\n\nPlaintiff faces neither an informational injury nor a stigmatic injury. She does not face an informational injury because she has no use for the information she seeks.\n\nShe's not interested in going to the hotel, so she has no reason for information about whether it is accessible. Nor does she face a stigmatic injury. This Court has held that a person is injured when she is personally subject to unequal treatment.\n\nBut that requirement is not satisfied by a plaintiff who searches for hotel websites on the internet to check whether they comply with her interpretation of the ADA.\n\nFinally, the Court should decide the question presented in this case. The circuits are divided. The question is important. The arguments are fully aired. And if the Court doesn't decide the question here, it may not have another opportunity to do so.\n\nThe Court should not bless a legal strategy of filing large numbers of lawsuits, settling almost all of them, and abandoning the rare case that threatens to create adverse precedent so as to facilitate the filing of another round of lawsuits.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: But Plaintiff says that she has withdrawn her suit. So why should we decide this? It seems as though it's finished.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, Plaintiff has withdrawn her suit. I mean, she hasn't promised not to bring new suits in the future. And if she doesn't, another plaintiff presumably will.\n\nPlaintiff's position is that any person with a disability with accessibility needs in America who visits a website can bring a lawsuit, so, presumably, another plaintiff will come forward and start bringing the same claims.\n\nJudge: Well, do you admit, though, that it would be easier to simply moot this out and wait on a suit that is still pending for another round to discuss standing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm actually not really sure it would be easier because I think that even if the Court does what Plaintiff asked, it would still be a significant precedential decision.\n\nI mean, the Court would essentially be blessing the legal strategy over our objection of filing large numbers of lawsuits and abandoning them at the last minute, and that, I think, would create a template for future plaintiffs to rely upon.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, I don't understand. You admit that this Plaintiff is not entitled to monetary relief.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: The hotel is owned by a different entity now, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: And so you would need a new Plaintiff and you would need a new Defendant --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor --\n\nJudge: -- to get a precedential -- to get a decision that's not advisory, because what you're saying to us, the issue is important.\n\nThis Plaintiff gets nothing. The Defendant has to be different because it's a different entity running it.\n\nSo tell me why it's not moot and tell me why we wouldn't be just giving an advisory opinion.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, if there was ever a live controversy, it's definitely moot at this point. We're not disputing that, Your Honor.\n\nWhat we're simply saying is that there was never a live controversy in the first place and the Court should therefore so hold.\n\nIn other words, the Court should say that whether it's moot is sort of immaterial because, from day one, there wasn't a case or controversy.\n\nJudge: I -- I'm sorry, I don't know why you haven't answered my question.\n\nWhy isn't this purely advisory once there's no longer a live controversy between the parties before us?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think it's an advisory opinion at all, Your Honor.\n\nBoth parties agree that the correct disposition of this case is to hold that there's no Article III case or controversy.\n\nWe simply disagree on the reasoning for that.\n\nJudge: Well, there's prudential doctrines. Standing is one of them. Mootness is another.\n\nBut I'm -- I'm unaware of any case where this Court had a standing and mootness issue and decided standing rather than mootness first.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not sure there's been a case in this particular configuration that's arrived at the Court before, but I don't think that there is a dispute in this case that the Court has the jurisdiction to decide either of the Article --\n\nJudge: Well, yes, we can decide either --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- and so I'm asking you in what case have we ever done this before, decided standing, which is a substantive question, when there's no live controversy before us?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I don't think the Court has decided on this particular constellation of facts a standing issue.\n\nBut, again, both parties agree that there's no case or controversy.

Well, I think it says on its face that it doesn't create liability that doesn't otherwise exist under this title.\n\nAnd the government concedes that the trustee, I think it said it six times, the trustee has a cause of action to which sovereign immunity has been waived under 544.\n\nIt's just contesting whether it went to the incorporated elements.\n\nAnd there's no logical distinction how 105 is not implicated to that waiver, but somehow it's implicated to the waivers extending to the elements.\n\nIt also just says otherwise existing under this title or non-bankruptcy law, and everyone concedes that the trustee has a cause of action but for one defense and one defense only, and that's sovereign immunity, which is the very defense that 106 waives.\n\nAnd I wanted to get to the 544(a) point because the government does not dispute that 106(a) does absolutely no more work under 544(a) than it does under 544(b), meaning 544(a) incorporates state law.\n\nAbsent a second waiver of immunity, which the government says accurately exists under -- I don't know if it's 28 U.S.C. but 2610, the -- the quiet title, there is no state law where a bona fide purchaser or bon -- a bona fide creditor could avoid the lien.\n\nSo both under (a) and (b), the government has its two-waiver theory.\n\n106(a) is just kind of irrelevant.\n\nAnd in terms of the idea that this applies to 59 sections, if you could put your shoes, pun intended, in the form of Congress, who overruled the Supreme Court's decisions in two of them, you're asking Congress to go back again.\n\nAnd in Hoffman, you said to Congress: You were too scattershot because you didn't list the code provisions.\n\nIt just would have applied to a hundred.\n\nHere, Congress listed all 59.\n\nAnd another thing that's interesting just about making Congress do this again, the government doesn't dispute that its position would make Congress have to go through and add a second waiver on all the provisions to which the state law is incorporated -- and we identified many --and they don't dispute that one of them is 547(b).\n\nAnd that's the very same issue in Hoffman.\n\nSo, if you rule against us, you're really telling Congress after all, they still need to go back and do it a third time and maybe a fourth time because, in the government's view, the state sovereign immunity will always creep in.\n\nJudge:\nBut, Counsel --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes?\n\nJudge:\n-- I guess I --I mean, I understand the need for two waivers here, but isn't that a function of Congress's policy choice to incorporate state law as the requirement of 544(b)?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's --\n\nJudge:\nYou seem to be accepting that Congress was, in 544(b), allowing for the trustee to stand in the shoes of the actual creditor, but you started off by saying the trustee can do more, essentially, by virtue of 106(a) than the actual creditor.\n\nAnd I feel like those two things are inconsistent.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWith respect, no.\n\nSo, as Justice -- first of all, the waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to 544 just on its face textually applies to the elements, to the same extent grammatically, logically that it applies to the claim.\n\nYou can't waive a claim without waiving the elements.\n\nBut, in terms of what Justice Gorsuch said, there's two very important caveats to this actual --\n\nJudge:\nNo.\n\nNo, no, no, I'm sorry.\n\nSorry.\n\nBefore you go to the second part, I don't understand that.\n\nI mean, I thought the waiver of sovereign immunity was a threshold issue that didn't tell us anything about the merits of whether or not you win the action underlying it. So we have this initial question, can you even bring this action? And then, when you bring it, the court goes on to adjudicate the merits, which is what the elements go to.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight, without regard to sovereign immunity, which is 106.\n\nIn the government's view, Congress --\n\nJudge:\nBut there's a -- there's a theory in which sovereign immunity is just doing the work of allowing you to bring the lawsuit to begin with.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nOnly to lose.\n\nJudge:\nWell, sometimes that happens.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAlways it will happen because no law, tribal, foreign, federal, no law anywhere waives sovereign immunity with respect to fraudulent transfers.\n\nJudge:\nBut 544(b) is bigger than the government.\n\nSo, you know, there could be other --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, 106 only relates to the government.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYou're just saying 106 was a way -- 106 application to 544 in all of its applications, (a) and (b) was a waste of time because sovereign immunity will always be incorporated under state law.\n\nAnd the point I was trying -- which is just a -- with respect, it's a dumb statute.\n\nWhy would Congress waive immunity only to see that there's no way to bring it, unless --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nMs. Dubin says that (a), they -- those -- those claims go forward all the time.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThey can't go forward, which she concedes, without a second waiver of immunity.\n\nAnd there's only two.\n\nThere's the federal government and then the four states' generic waiver -- four states --\n\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, there's an action against the --the people who engaged in the fraudulent transfer.\n\nSo 544(a) -- (b) is not useless.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt's useless as to governments.\n\nJudge:\nWell, but why does that matter?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nBecause 106 is a statute.\n\nJudge:\nIt's not -- it's not useless.\n\nYou agree that under 544(b) incorporates some state law defenses, like the statute of limitations.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAll of them.\n\nAnd this is my second point.\n\nJudge:\nThat's all of them.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo, to state law --\n\nJudge:\nExcept you're saying all of them --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nExcept for one.\n\nJudge:\nState sovereign immunity?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo, because that's waived by 106.\n\nIf I -- that would be even weirder to have Congress --\n\nJudge:\nThat -- that brings us to the constitutional question.\n\nBut, if 544(b) requires an actual creditor, correct, who can bring the claim, so if there's no creditor who can bring the claim because the statute of limitations has passed, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nCorrect, that the actual creditor requirement assumes that all state law elements are met --\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nThank you, Counsel.\n\nJudge:\nMs. Counsel, if I might just turn us to 544(b), where I think, you know, the rubber meets the road, and the view on -- I think it's common ground that you -- the trustee steps into the shoes of -- of the creditor.\n\nAnd then the question is, what does this voidability language mean?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "914", "dialogue": "udge: This case-by-case approach—I understand some of my colleagues' concerns about it. But I go back to the text, which permits the states to do this and says \"unless,\" and it's the \"unless\" that's creating this problem. But the presumption is that there's no preemption, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s correct. And the point I was making about discrimination is that even if you assume the worst-case scenario—that this all becomes so complicated that banks decide it's just not worth trying to establish preemption under \"prevents or significantly interferes with\"—they're still left with substantial protection against discriminatory laws.\n\nJudge: All right. Can we go to the inherent issue raised in co-counsel’s question? He said you're costing the banks money, and that's a greater burden than it was in a previous case. Now, you point out another case where it also cost them money. Do you have an argument as to why his reasoning—that the previous case sets a sort of maximum or minimum—is incorrect?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the previous case didn't cost the bank money in the sense of forcing it to make outlays, but it cost the bank money in the sense of making it more difficult to attract customers and thereby earn money. The bank officers testified that it was harder to get consumers to sign up for savings accounts if they couldn’t use the word \"savings\" in their pitch. They had consumer surveys showing that consumers were more likely to recognize the word \"savings.\"\n\nJudge: No, I understand that, but—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it would be an artificial distinction to draw a line between state laws that require a bank to make an outlay and state laws that simply make it more difficult for the bank to earn money.\n\nJudge: Well then, answer why this isn't a significant interference. How do you measure that when it's costing the bank money?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: One thing you would want to look at is to what extent the bank could earn money on the escrow account and what relationship that potential earning has to the interest it was required to pay out. When people defend the use of escrow accounts, it's never on the ground that they are a good way for banks to earn money. Instead, they argue that escrow accounts protect the bank’s collateral against risks like failure to pay taxes or failure to maintain insurance.\n\nJudge: So, in essence, you're almost saying this would be an easy case to prove? If they can earn 5% and only have to pay out 2%, there's no substantial interference?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That would be right.\n\nJudge: And if they can’t earn any money on this and still have to pay out, that might be?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, then you’re at least trying to determine whether that mandatory outlay is significant.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: Next question. This significance test—it's not common in preemption inquiries. Usually, we need an answer that applies everywhere and for all time. If economic conditions change, does that mean a law could be preempted one day and not the next? Would different states with the same law have different preemption outcomes depending on their economic circumstances? That seems like an odd way to approach preemption.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would point to prior cases that discuss similar preemption standards. If a state law explicitly regulates core aspects of an industry, like rates or services, it’s preempted outright. But when a law regulates something else that indirectly affects an industry, courts have had to engage in pragmatic inquiries.\n\nJudge: But you’re not giving much reassurance about the concern that this could lead to different rules in different states or different rulings depending on when a case is brought.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That is something Congress signed up for. But it's actually a benefit to the banks. If Congress had prioritized administrative ease above all else, it could have just relied on the antidiscrimination standard. Instead, Congress provided an additional standard that allows banks to argue that a state law significantly interferes with their operations. They can choose to invoke it or not.\n\nJudge: Moving on. The statute references prior cases. It states that \"where Congress does not expressly condition the grant of power upon state permission, the Court has ordinarily found no such condition applies.\" It then references another case and states that the federal statute explicitly grants a national bank an authorization, permission, or power, and contains no indication that Congress intended to subject that power to local restriction. How do you interpret that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That was in response to an argument made by the state in that case. The conflict was clear—the federal statute said national banks may sell insurance in small towns, but the state statute said they cannot. The state argued that the federal law only allowed banks to do this if state law permitted it. The Court rejected that, saying that’s not how federal authorizations usually work. If the federal law says banks can do something and state law says they can’t, federal law prevails.\n\nJudge: One more question. You said earlier that banks could do this without material impairment. Is that still your position?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. We have not seen any evidence suggesting that a bank could not comply.\n\nJudge: If compliance results in higher costs for banks, leading to decreased availability of credit or higher interest rates, is that a material impairment?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Out-of-pocket expenses alone wouldn’t be enough. The banks would have to prove that the burden meaningfully deters them from offering their services.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "451", "dialogue": "\nJudge: Yes, I would, and -- and let me make two other points.\n\nOne is that for a noncitizen in immigration proceedings, even on the government's view, basically, every deadline up until this final order follows the traditional rule.\n\nSo, if you're a noncitizen going through immigration proceedings, you know my brief is due on a Saturday; that means it's due on a Monday.\n\nI need to file an appeal on a Saturday; that means it's due on a Monday.\n\nIt's only this very last deadline that follows a different rule.\n\nSo I do think that would be a trap for the unwary.\n\nAnd the last point I would make is that, yes, I think, when you have everything consistently pointing in the same way not just in the law, but the D.C. Circuit made this point in Sherwood, this rule is not just a lawyerly contrivance.\n\nIt's also meant to capture the way that things work out in the world, in business, in society.\n\nAnd so just one concrete example.\n\nThe motion that was filed in this case was sent by FedEx priority overnight on a Friday.\n\nThat means it gets there Monday morning.\n\nAnd I'm not suggesting that anything in our case turns on the vagaries of FedEx's shipping policies.\n\nIt's just to say that even in business, overnight on a Friday sometimes means Monday.\n\nThis is a principle that applies across the board.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Do you know whether the government, in fact, applies this rollover rule to anything that's not a filing deadline? I mean, you mentioned fingerprinting.\n\nYou mentioned marriage.\n\nBut what is the government's policy as to anything that's not a file -- filing deadline?\n\nDefendant: I think the AILA amicus brief gets into this most clearly.\n\nIt provides examples of immigration judges applying this day in and day out.\n\nI think the -- most of the examples we've collected are actually in the voluntary departure context, but I -- I think there are other examples in that brief as well of situations where this applies.\n\nAnd I should point out this is -- in the voluntary departure context, for example, it's a 60-day statutory ceiling.\n\nSo an immigration judge in an individual case could, for example, set the deadline earlier or set the deadline on a date certain.\n\nThis is just about the rule that applies, absent another indication.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJustice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Justice Gorsuch, anything? No? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: Can I just ask, so it's a trap for the unwary because the filing of the motion triggers the extension, is that right?\n\nDefendant: In our view, the departure deadline and the motion deadline move together.\n\nSo it's -- it's -- the 60-day voluntary departure deadline?\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant: On the government's view, operates differently than every other deadline that's --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nNo, I understand that, but I guess I was -- I was trying to -- I hear Justice Alito raising the point that if a person is told they have 60 days to get out of the country, when we're getting to day 58, 59, or whatever, they should be ready to go.\n\nAnd so are they getting two extra days or, like, what is happening? And I guess your response is that the way that the rules operate, if that person files a motion, that motion then needs to be resolved by the court and the person can stay until that happens.\n\nSo what's really the trap is that ordinarily, when you file a motion, you get to the following Monday if the deadline is over the weekend, and that's the way it works in every other scenario.\n\nAnd yet, here, you'd be filing the motion and it wouldn't.\n\nDefendant: That's exactly right.\n\nI think that captures it, and that's what happened to our client in this case with quite severe consequences if the government's view is adopted.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nMr. Yang.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1229c's maximum 60-day period for voluntary departure is not extended when the last day falls on a weekend or a holiday.\n\nThe requirement to arrange for travel and to depart the United States involves primary conduct in the real world.\n\nNothing prevents departure on weekends or holidays, when many prefer to travel.\n\nAnd unlike contexts involving the timing of litigation-based or administrative acts before courts or agencies, no tradition by rule or otherwise potentially exists for extending statutory deadlines for primary conduct.\n\nBut, first, statutory jurisdiction is lacking in the highly atypical posture here. Section 1252(a)(1) grants jurisdiction to review final orders of removal.\n\nBut, in Petitioner's case, it does not involve review of a final order of removal.\n\nIt does not affect the validity of a final order of removal.\n\nAnd it does not even affect how you would implement a final order of removal.\n\nMoreover, Petitioner has other avenues for judicial review of the timing issue here. He could seek APA review after unsuccessfully seeking DHS to return his voluntary departure bond or to adjust his status in the country. Now, on the merits, Section 1229c's test reflects the default rule that the 60-day statutory minimum means what it says.\n\nJudge: Mr. Yang, did you raise the jurisdictional issue below?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We raised a different one, not this one.\n\nWe raised this issue in our -- in our Op, albeit abbreviated form, but we did in our Op.\n\nJudge: Petitioner argues that this is, in fact, non-jurisdictional and that you waived it.\n\nWould you respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nThis is jurisdictional.\n\nSection 1252(a)(1) provides for review of a final order of removal, and that's the jurisdictional provision because it applies the Hobbs Act.\n\nThe Hobbs Act provision, the -- the jurisdictional provision of the Hobbs Act is Section 2342.\n\nIt provides review in the court of appeals of seven distinct types of orders but not orders in the immigration context, only orders from other agencies.\n\nSo the way, as Mata recognizes, the way that there is jurisdiction here is 1252(a)(1) grants jurisdiction to review final orders of removal and then just plugs that into the Hobbs Act.\n\nJudge: And -- and when you say \"final order of removal,\" what do you think that encompasses?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah, I -- I think there's a few things.\n\nAnd this is -- after the Court's decision in Nasrallah, it is the following.\n\nIt is the final order of removal itself.\n\nJudge: Now what -- what does that mean, \"the final order of removal itself\"?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That --\n\nJudge: Is it --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- just the determination that somebody ought to be removed, or is it everything else that appears in the final order?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Not the latter.\n\nWe made that argument.\n\nIt was rejected in Nasrallah.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "674", "dialogue": "Judge: Correct? But, as I understand it, after this decision and -- and maybe after the previous case before that, there was some question about whether it also criminalized having fires, campfires, and tents.\n\nJudge: Can you talk a little bit about that and what the scope of it is? Does the Constitution then make it impossible for a city to limit the use of fires and encampments, tents, those kinds of temporary shelters?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It really does because the rationale of the previous case, the argument that it's a biological necessity to sleep outside, the respondents argue a blanket is necessary in one state; some might argue a tent and a fire is necessary in another.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The Eighth Amendment really doesn't give us any answers to what cities can and can't prohibit. It's really administratively impossible for cities on the ground, as well as for courts, to administer. So we're seeing --\n\nJudge: I'm sorry. This -- we have nothing to do with fires or tents. That was exempted under the district court's injunction, and the circuit court didn't require that.\n\nJudge: We're talking only about sleeping with a blanket.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think --\n\nJudge: Well, so let's narrow it to what it is.\n\nJudge: I agree there might be other cases in the circuit that are not rational, and I don't mean to throw aspersions at -- at those holdings, but some of them are not permitting time/place restrictions.\n\nJudge: Let's go beyond that. Let's go here. Here, you're not precluded from prohibiting fires. You're not precluded from prohibiting tents.\n\nJudge: What's at issue is whether you are prohibited from keeping -- having someone wear a blanket anywhere in the city.\n\nJudge: Your intent was to remove -- stated by your mayor, the intent is to remove every homeless person and give them no public space to sit down with a blanket or lay down with a blanket and fall asleep.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's not the intent of the law. And I would like to --\n\nJudge: Well --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- address that point because the other side has --\n\nJudge: -- why don't you answer the basic question?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So --\n\nJudge: It's not about fires. It's not about tents. It's about not being -- a time and place restriction about eliminating all choices.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we think that it is harmful for people to be living in public spaces on streets and in parks, whatever bedding materials. When humans are living in those conditions, we think that that's not compassionate and that there's no dignity in that.\n\nJudge: Oh, it's not, but --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: -- neither is -- neither is providing them with nothing --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, we --\n\nJudge: -- to alleviate that situation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This is a difficult policy question, Your Honor. It is. And --\n\nJudge: Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks compassion --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We --\n\nJudge: -- and passes a law identical to this? Where are they supposed to sleep? Are they supposed to kill themselves, not sleeping?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So this is -- a necessity defense, as I mentioned, under state law is available. States are able to address these concerns.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This is a complicated policy question. We believe that the Eighth Amendment analysis, to go back to it, focuses on the low-level fines.\n\nJudge: What's so complicated about letting someone somewhere sleep with a blanket in the outside if they have nowhere to sleep? The laws against defecation, the laws against keeping things unsanitary around yourself, those have all been upheld.\n\nJudge: The only thing this injunction does is say you can't stop someone from sleeping in a public place without a blanket.\n\nJudge: Why don't you answer and then we'll move on to the next round, and you can be thinking about an answer while we move into a different stage of the argument.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Is being a bank robber a status?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. I would say that -- well -- well, if -- if your question is asking would it be permissible to punish being a bank robber, I think that would have vagueness problems probably.\n\nJudge: Well, it would be someone who robbed a bank. That doesn't sound vague.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I don't -- I -- I don't think that it is a status in the sense of precedent cases, which, again, I -- I want to just focus on what we think that case stands for, and it's only its narrow holding about addiction.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the -- there, it was the status of being an addict without any mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So a law like that -- excuse me -- without any actus reus. A law like that is problematic without an actus reus.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it would probably have vagueness problems, due process problems.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: However, the Eighth Amendment, this entire exercise under precedent, is the only time this Court has ever evaluated the substantive criminal law, and it raises all of these line-drawing problems.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the fact that -- I'm not here to defend that precedent as a matter of first principles. We don't agree with it. We think it was wrongly decided.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We're just saying that it is so far removed -- that our laws are so far removed from what was at issue in that case that it just isn't implicated here.\n\nJudge: So, if someone is homeless for a week and then finds available shelter, is that person homeless when he's in the shelter?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Under federal law, the regulations, he is actually considered homeless. That shows the fluidity and the different ways of --\n\nJudge: Putting the regulations to one side, can someone who is sleeping in a shelter be considered homeless?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Some would say yes, that someone who --\n\nJudge: What would you say?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I would say that at that point he is sheltered and homeless. I think he -- he -- that -- that is also --\n\nJudge: All right. Let me make it easier.\n\nJudge: What if he buys a home or finds a home or is given a home?

If they got the sales records or not, you don't know?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We --we do not have those.\r\n\r\nWe would need discovery.\r\n\r\nJudge: The government would probably tell us that.\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice?\r\n\r\nJudge: If I just could go back to the questions that the other Justice asked you, because it strikes me that, from your answer, the Ponzi scheme is actually a bad term for what you're suggesting.\r\n\r\nA Ponzi scheme is like you're -- you're -- you're never going to get caught up.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\r\n\r\nJudge: And it's just dishonesty after dishonesty after dishonesty to try to hide that fact.\r\n\r\nBut you're not suggesting that.\r\n\r\nYou're actually saying that if things had worked out a little bit differently --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- in the market for crypto and --and in the -- and in other markets that the company was involved in, the company is now the company that's sending the stock market into the stratosphere, we would never have known about this.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: You know? So the Defendant might have been making a pretty good bet here.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Exactly.\r\n\r\nAnd --and your answer is much better than mine was.\r\n\r\nRight. Exactly. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I --I think that there's a difference between someone who's carrying on a scheme where it's inevitable that they're going to get caught and someone who's rationally calculating that the market might not catch up to what they're saying.\r\n\r\nJudge: I'm sorry, Justice? Justice?\r\n\r\nJudge: How much money is at stake in this case, in other words, if you were to prevail ultimately in the class?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Not as much as it might seem because -- well, I don't want the Court to get the impression that this enormous delta of -- of sales is what's at issue.\r\n\r\nWhat would be at issue would be we would have to show lost causation and materiality --\r\n\r\nJudge: What are you seeking?

{"id": "1027", "dialogue": "Judge\nWhere is that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nThat would be in Document 1 of the record at paragraph 16, which --\n\nJudge\nI mean, I guess another way of stating the question is we would be deciding the question as if there were a set of facts that are not true.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nCorrect --\n\nJudge\nI mean, she was employed.\n\nJudge\nDo you dispute that she was disabled before she retired? Do you dispute that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nNo, we do -- we do not dispute that she was disabled, but we dispute that any discrimination occurred while she was a disabled -- a qualified individual with a disability because she took -- she became completely unqualified, meaning unable to perform the essential functions of her job, and then she took a disability retirement, and then the City applied its 24-month rule to her. So the only time that the alleged discrimination occurred was when she was an unqualified individual after she had --\n\nJudge\nSo -- so --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- taken her retirement.\n\nJudge\n-- under that view, a person cannot sue for retirement-related benefits discrimination because it seems to me that you're saying that if a person becomes disabled while they are still employed, to the extent that the policy has not yet been applied, the policy concerning the retirement benefits, because they're still employed, they can't sue about it.\n\nAnd then, when they retire and the policy is applied, they can't sue about it because they become unqualified at that point in your view.\n\nSo how do you ever challenge discrimination concerning a policy that relates to retirement benefits and disability?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nJustice, neither the City nor the Eleventh Circuit said that a qualified individual could never sue over discrimination in post-employment benefits.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit, in fact, acknowledged that that is a possible scenario.\n\nThere is a -- a possibility that somebody who is qualified and has --\n\nJudge\nI guess I --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- if they become subject to the policy during their employment --\n\nJudge\nCan -- can you help me understand why the qualified individual designation in the statute has anything to do with this? My -- my instinct is sort of closer to Justice Alito's in terms of qualified individual coming up in the reasonable accommodations context.\n\nThis is not that context.\n\nSo I don't even understand the work that it is doing with respect to setting some sort of temporal limit as to whether or not this person can sue for retirement benefits.\n\nSo I -- I didn't -- yeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nBecause -- it's because the language in the anti-discrimination provision expressly draws a line as to who it's protecting.\n\nIt says no employer shall discriminate against a person who can perform the job they hold or desire.\n\nAnd no other person is protected that you can only -- you're only prohibited from discriminating against a person who presently holds a job that they desire.\n\nSo --\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nAnd she says, at the time that I held the job, I became disabled and that policy applied to me.\n\nIt -- I was subject to it in that period of time.\n\nSo, as Justice says, why would we pretend as though that is not a fact in the case, not here, and decide this on a broader question that relates to people who did not hold the job during the time that they were qualified?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nBecause the policy that she describes, that she claims is discriminatory and she describes in her complaint, on its face only applies to a person who becomes completely unable to perform their job and is, therefore, unqualified.\n\nSo it would be the same if the City had a policy that said, if you become completely unqualified and unable to perform the essential functions of your job, we will terminate your employment.\n\nAnd that is perfectly -- that is not unlawful under the ADA.\n\nBut what she's claiming is, if you wrote down something that is lawful, that is not controversial at all, that if you become unable to perform your job, we can terminate you because you're no longer a qualified individual, but she's saying, I could sue to prevent you from doing something to an unqualified individual that the ADA does not prohibit.\n\nShe -- she's claiming that the 24-month rule only applies to a disability retiree.\n\nAnd a disability retiree is not just somebody with a disability.\n\nIt is defined as somebody who is -- who is permanently and completely unable to do the job.\n\nThat's why she was awarded a disability retirement, because she became an unqualified individual.\n\nAnd only those who take the disability retirement -- if she had been non-disabled and retired with the 20 years that -- that she had served, she would have received no subsidy, health insurance subsidy, whatsoever.\n\nThe City made an exception because of her disability, out of compassion, that even though everybody else who only serves for 20 years only receives -- receives no health insurance subsidy, out of compassion, for those who retire because they are completely disabled and unable to do the job, we will give 24 months of the health insurance subsidy.\n\nJudge\nSo I understand that argument, but that -- doesn't that just go to the merits of her disability claim? Is she stating -- this is Justice Alito's point -- a claim for disability -- or, excuse me, of -- for discrimination.\n\nYou -- you've raised the objection, an objection that has something to do with the fact that she's post-retirement, and that's what's confusing to me.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nIt's because, when she was post-retirement, she was an unqualified individual.\n\nShe was totally disabled and unable to perform the essential functions of her job, which takes you outside of the protections of Title I because Title I only prohibits discrimination against a person who can perform a job they presently hold or desire.\n\nSo someone who neither holds a job, desires a job, and is completely unable to perform the job is -- does not fall --\n\nJudge\nIs that the --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- under the protections.\n\nJudge\n-- same with respect to Title VII?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nTitle VII does not use the phrase \"qualified individuals.\" It refers broadly to the -- to individuals or employees, which is why, in Robinson, this Court said that under Title VII, the -- the use of the word \"employees\" in the anti-discrimination provision of Title VII was ambiguous because \"employee\" was defined as a person employed, past tense.\n\nAnd that could be ambiguous, is employed or was employed.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "282", "dialogue": "Judge: Actually, I'm more interested in the fact pattern that we have here. Your business—you have a rule that's adopted. It's final. It's been challenged. Then you go into business, you begin to operate under these rules, and you claim, of course, that's the beginning of your injury, and then, of course, you say that restarts the statute of limitations. That's what I'm interested in.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So in the—in the—in the regulatory context?\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And so, in the regulatory context, as far as we know, the APA—2401 is the only rule that applies that way.\n\nJudge: Okay. So—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But that—\n\nJudge: —if that's the case, do you have an example that is similar to yours?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the Herr—the Herr family in the Sixth Circuit—\n\nJudge: So that's the only one?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, every—the lower courts have rejected our reading of 2401.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And so there wouldn't be other cases because they would have been time-barred under that rule.\n\nJudge: Counsel, there—there is something about this that plagues at the back of my mind, which is, how can someone be injured who goes into a business knowing its structure? Meaning this is the business that you've accepted. The rule was passed whatever number of years ago. There's no enforcement against you. I understand injury when the government's seeking to compel you to do something or to stop doing something. But there's no injury in my mind when you enter a business knowing its structure and accepting rules that have been final. So explain to me what makes sense in—this has often been called a facial challenge as opposed to an as-applied challenge, and I think that for valid reasons, which is, if you go in, you accept the regulatory conditions of the business, and you're not burdened because you knew it going in.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that assumes that—that small business owners understand the entire regulatory regime that they're entering before they actually go into business. And I think this Court has recognized that it is—that is a tall task to ask of any small business owner like Corner Post. But the first time Corner Post was ever actually injured is the time that they—they did pay the actual debit card fees that—that they had to pay whenever they swiped a debit card. So that's the first time there is any injury. And so accrual-based statutes, this Court has—has, I think, recognized throughout history, are necessarily plaintiff-specific, and that's exactly what we have here. The first time the plaintiff here was harmed is when that plaintiff's cause of action accrues to challenge that particular rule.\n\nJudge: But I think what the previous question suggested is that this is a context in which this would be a quite novel rule. There are no other statutes of limitations that work this way. And with respect to this statute of limitations, the consensus view of all the circuits, until the Herr case came along, which was fairly recently in a little bit different context, but the consensus view of all the circuits was that the statute of limitations began to run when you had final agency action. Of course, what typically would happen, a rule like this, is that there would be that final agency action, many people would challenge the rule, trade associations of the same kind that are in back of this case, that that challenge would go forward. You would get a decision. It would be final. It would create the legal background rule sometimes for an entire industry, and that was the end of the matter. And, you know, what you're suggesting is a very different rule than the administrative sphere has worked under for many, many years.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we don't think so. I—I think that the—the 29 examples that the government points out in its brief of agency-specific repose-based statutes shows that Congress intended to have a different rule for the APA. It has not subjected—\n\nJudge: Well, it doesn't show that. I mean, the APA, you're right, it's different language. It says accrues. Now, you know, \"accrues\" just means arises. There's nothing in the language itself that—that would suggest that your principle is mandated. We do, you're quite right, have a general principle that when we see something that says \"accrues,\" what that usually means is that there's a—a—a full cause of action that can be brought. But this is a very different context in which the rule has operated differently for decades and decades and decades, where no court has ever suggested your solution until, again, the Herr case. And I guess I would suggest there's nothing in the word \"accrues\" that suggests that every court for decades and decades and decades has been wrong.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So in the brief, you talked about clearing the encampment at McPherson Square. Can you just describe briefly, if you can—do police then make individualized inquiries? How does this work?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, what happened there was, I think, the gold standard of the way this should be done, and larger cities have this ability.\n\nThe Park Service cooperated very closely with the District government. The Park Service does not have the sort of social services that a municipality has in D.C., and so that function is split.\n\nThese are special National Park properties, but the National Park Service relies, as the federal government does, on the federal protective service for buildings elsewhere, cooperating with the local government.\n\nThe local government's social service workers or nonprofits went out and interviewed everybody in the encampment in McPherson Square and informed them about the services available.\n\nThere was advance notice given that the encampment was going to be cleared within—I think it was 30 days. People were warned 30 days in advance. They were warned the night before and the day before, so they could collect their belongings.\n\nSome just moved elsewhere, while others accepted the city's offer and went into shelters. That is typically how shelters—excuse me—encampments are cleared, particularly in cities that have provided amicus briefs explaining the problem.\n\nThis is not the scenario we've been discussing, where a law enforcement officer encounters a person for the first time. Smaller cities don’t have that capability, but Grants Pass does have outreach workers who carry on the dialogue. That’s how the encampment was cleared.\n\nJudge: And so, given that experience and the fact that Martin has actually been the law since 2018, we don't really have to speculate as to how this works, right? I mean, this is happening—this is the law right now in the Ninth Circuit.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The Robinson principle is.\n\nJudge: The Robinson principle as adopted in Martin. My understanding is, for example, California says that’s the law, they comply with it, and that’s how it is.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah. They are not asking for Robinson to be overruled. What they are objecting to are the injunctions that go well beyond that.\n\nJudge: Yes, I understand. I'm just responding to some of the questions you've gotten about how this rule works—whether it can work—because some seem to suggest that this isn't already happening on the ground in these places.\n\nShelters and workers are aware of what is available. People are being advised. The principle from Martin, at least in the Ninth Circuit, states that as long as there are more homeless individuals in a jurisdiction than available beds, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute homeless individuals for sitting, lying, or sleeping.\n\nThis is not a new rule. That is the law right now in that situation, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, that’s what Martin says. I don’t want to say that the clearance procedures work perfectly in every case or that they’re always available, but—\n\nJudge: No, I just mean we don’t have to speculate about how the rule works.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Or—yeah, how—\n\nJudge: It's not a new thing being asked for today.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: How it’s supposed to work.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: All I’m saying is that there may be imperfections—\n\nJudge: All right. Let me ask you about whether or not you are asking for an extension of Robinson. That has come up a couple of times, and I don’t see an extension being asked for.\n\nCan you explain whether there’s some sort of extension of Robinson happening today?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: So you’re not suggesting that people should be excused from engaging in otherwise criminal conduct? We've heard an example about people stealing to eat—that would be a case where someone is actively participating in what would otherwise be criminal behavior if anyone did it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the idea, I guess, is that maybe these people need to do it, and so that might be some sort of excuse. That’s not what’s happening in this case, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, that’s correct.

{"id": "818", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Miller.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Maybe I'll begin with Justice Jackson's question about page 51.\n\nWe have six programs here, including the EMS program, which is a major feature of the government's motion to dismiss that is the subject of this case. The third-party revenue spending has to be anchored to those six programs. It cannot be spent on a dental program. We don't see dental there. It cannot be spent just on general health. Even interpreting that term broadly and generously in light of the Indian canon, it still has to be anchored in these six programs.\n\nWith regard to these six programs, when the Indian Health Service awarded a contract to the San Carlos Apache Tribe—and just visualize this, we're talking about 1.8 million acres, about 29,000 square miles, a thousand miles of roadless area, a couple of hours east of Phoenix—the Emergency Medical Service program was severely underfunded.\n\nSo, on page 101, the Indian Health Service demands that the tribe agree to a clause that says, in running the EMS program, it will maintain an efficient billing system to maximize third-party revenues. Why? Because IHS knew that there was no way this program could be run at even a moderate level without third-party revenues coming into the program and going out into the program, coming in from program income and going out into services.\n\nSo that's why this clause is such a pivotal element of the contract.\n\nNow we rely on (m)—(m)(1), and (m)(1) was enacted in 1994, but that was not the first time the concept that program income goes into the contract was invented.\n\nFirst of all, it is a standard government contracting clause in the OMB regulations. You can go to 2 C.F.R. 200.307, I think it's (e)(2).\n\nBut, more specifically, the Indian Health Service, in the sample contract that the Indian Health Service had in the 1980s, required that all program income be spent to provide additional services and benefits under the contract.\n\nSo this was an old concept, not a new concept, that Congress put in there in 1994. Well, why did Congress put it in 1994? I mean, there it was in the sample contract that IHS had because Congress decided that IHS could not be trusted to administer this program at all.\n\nThat was the positive provision, that program income comes into the contract, but there were a lot of negative provisions in the old sample contract. There were a lot of negative provisions in regulations that IHS had adopted, proposed to adopt in January '94.\n\nSo Congress comes in, clears the decks, says we are declaring what the master contract is going to say, we are prohibiting a raft of things that the agency proposed in these regulations, but we are cementing the good things.\n\nAnd one of the good things was (m)(1), that all program income had to go to further the general purposes of the contract.\n\nSo too the question about (a)(2) and (a)(3) and how they relate.\n\nThey require the administration—the overhead has to be in connection with the expenditure of—of—of—excuse me, with the administration of the contract.\n\nAnd the contract, as we just saw, requires the spending of program income.\n\nSo we satisfy (a)(3).\n\nIt's, of course, part of the federal program that we discussed earlier. The federal program includes direct service spending from the secretarial amount and also program income spending.\n\nSo—and IHS spends both tranches of money. The tribe spends both tranches of money.\n\nJudge: You've heard—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So it's indisputably part of the federal program.\n\nJudge: You've heard questions about a situation where the tribe may be spending money on services that go primarily to non-tribal members. What is your principle for limiting that, if there is one?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nWell, of course, as was pointed out earlier, it's not presented in this case, but I will answer the question.\n\nThe issue of the government's obligation with respect to services to non-beneficiaries has been litigated in another setting.\n\nContract support costs are not the only mandatory spending under the Act. There's also leasing that is mandatory spending.\n\nIf a tribe uses a tribal facility to run the federal program, then the federal government needs to pay the leasing costs.\n\nThat issue has been litigated, and the courts have held in the Jamestown case that there's a reasonableness limitation to the leasing costs.\n\nIncidentally, reasonableness comes up twice, once in (a)(2), once in (a)(3). So there's a reasonableness limitation on the overhead also.\n\nSo that's just thing one.\n\nJudge: Well, but that presumably doesn't have anything to do with the allocation between tribal members and non-tribal members.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Oh, no.\n\nWith respect, Your Honor, it would mean in this situation that if there were substantial overhead costs associated with services to non-beneficiaries, then you would discount that element, and IHS would not be responsible for reimbursing it.\n\nAnd I should note that IHS has a mechanism already for doing this.\n\nIHS does this in the leasing arena.\n\nIf I go to IHS and ask for a lease to compensate for the use of a tribal facility, IHS will ask for data, how many non-beneficiaries do you serve?\n\nZero.\n\nThen they cover the whole lease.\n\nFifty percent, which is unheard of, but there are examples, I suppose, then IHS will whack off a part of the leasing cost to be sure that they are only supporting services to Indians because this is an Indian healthcare program.\n\nJudge: Can I ask—on the question of whether the tribe can use this money for something that IHS itself couldn't use the money for? If that happened with the use of these third-party income funds, overhead costs, your answer?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nThank you, Your Honor.\n\nWe don't have a separate appropriation for construction. IHS does.\n\nThat's how they get their construction money—a quarter of a billion dollars, but—\n\nJudge: That is not an answer to the statutory question that was posed earlier. That’s a real-world answer, which is a good real-world answer, but I don’t think it’s a great statutory answer. So keep going.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I agree with Your Honor that if a construction activity serves the general purposes of, let's just take the EMS program, then it's under the umbrella.\n\nLet's consider it.\n\nSo building a garage to house the ambulances or to do maintenance work on the ambulances—yes.\n\nTo build a new facility where the ambulance crews were sleeping because they were decrepit and there were holes in the walls and it was not an acceptable place for ambulance crews to sleep in between calls—yes, reconstructing a new facility to house the ambulance crews, absolutely.\n\nAre those construction activities things that the tribe can do with the third-party revenue money but that IHS cannot do because it needs permission from Congress? Yes. That is a fact.\n\nJudge: Yes is the answer to that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes is the answer to that question.\n\nJudge: Would you ever—\n\nJudge: And the overhead—the overhead for that, just to follow up on that, the overhead for that, or maybe you already answered this, I just want to—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, but thank you for asking the question.\n\nSo the overhead on that, just as if you and I hire a—\n\nJudge: That’s what you’re seeking, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, but there would be no overhead on it, is what I was about to say, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Are you going to include any overhead as contract support?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "332", "dialogue": "Judge:\nSo let me return to Justice Kagan's questions.\n\nYou know, she asked you whether, really, the more natural way to think about this is that it is discriminating on the basis of transgender status rather than -- you know, I -- I feel like trying to make the Bostock-like argument, holding all things equal or that you have to do this by reference to, you know, biological sex, feels like an odd way to solve the problem and kind of that hypothetical I gave you about the drug that just has the transitioning purpose.\n\nSo, if we just head-on confront the question which you raise in the second part of your brief about whether transgender status should be a suspect class, one question I have is: At least as far as I can think of, we don't have a history of de jure -- or that I know of, we don't have a history of de jure discrimination against transgender people, right? It's -- you -- you point out in -- in your brief that in the last three years there have been these laws, but before that, we might have had private societal discrimination.\n\nBut I -- I don't know of, but am I miss -- you know, is there a history that I don't know about where we have de jure discrimination? And my concern about it is this.\n\nAll of the other suspect classes that we've recognized so far do have that long de jure history of discrimination.\n\nAnd, you know, the Equal Protection Clause applies to state action, so it feels like an odd fit to say that in their private lives, people have discriminated against transgender people; therefore, we're going to treat it as a suspect class for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo I think you may be right that the discrimination -- historical discrimination against transgender people may not have been reflected in the laws, but I think there's no dispute that there is a broad history here, and it hasn't just been confined to private actors.\n\nI -- I think that if you actually looked at the facts, there's a wealth of evidence to suggest that transgender people throughout history have been subjected to -- to violence and discrimination and maybe lost employment opportunities or housing opportunities even in contexts where there might be state public employment at play.\n\nAnd, of course, that's especially reflected now in the law, where there has been this, I think, attention and focus on trying to limit transgender people from being able to live and identify consistent with their gender identity in our society.\n\nSo I don't even understand the State to be disputing the historical discrimination point.\n\nBut, if you're approaching this from the standpoint of saying is this a group with a distinguishing characteristic that has no bearing on their ability to contribute and that needs some protection from the courts, I think, if any group qualifies, this one does in light of the current laws and what might come in the future. And our -- our basic argument is, if you can look ahead and say maybe the states will ban medical care for adults who are transgender, maybe they'll ban adoption by transgender people or not allow them to be teachers, you know, that doesn't look anything like the workaday economic regulation that just gets rational basis review. And I think the Court could give effect to that intuition.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, and I don't want to be misunderstood to say that I don't think there's a problem or that there hasn't been private discrimination.\n\nI guess it doesn't seem analogous to me to say race or gender or national origin, those kinds of things, because we did have de jure discrimination to point to.\n\nAnd so I guess what my -- what I'm thinking is, when we are in the business of identifying suspect classes, you know, in Cleburne, we expressed -- and I'm not saying that this is analogous to Cleburne in that respect, but we expressed in Cleburne hesitancy, you know, to identify groups such as the elderly, you know, or the mentally disabled as suspect classes, in part because those are judgments that are pretty hard for courts to make.\n\nAnd at least de jure discrimination of the sort experienced by women, you know, or people on the basis of race gives us something to point to if we're going to be identifying a new suspect class, which we haven't done for a long time.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYeah.\n\nAnd I, of course, take that point.\n\nAnd I should reiterate we don't think the Court has to confront it here.\n\nBut, in -- in the cases involving age and disability, I understand the -- the Court to have approached those issues with somewhat different reasoning, that age is something we all experience, that disability is a broad and diverse group, and that individuals with disabilities have been able to harness the majoritarian political forces to protect their rights.\n\nAnd none of that is true here.\n\nTransgender individuals are a discrete minority.\n\nI think there's no dispute that they are being subject to a wave of legislation across the states today, and -- and I think that this is the kind of circumstance where the Court could rightly recognize that heightened scrutiny should apply.\n\nJudge:\nLast question.\n\nDo you agree with me that the resolution of this case has no impact on the parental rights claim that the Sixth Circuit also addressed?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThat's right.\n\nI -- I think we are not making a substantive due process parental rights claim here, and this Court obviously didn't grant review of that issue.\n\nI will say that I think parental rights are actually relevant to the Equal Protection Clause as well insofar as it's significant to me that Tennessee, in choosing to categorically ban this care, is taking a sharp turn away from how it ordinarily handles parental rights in the medical decision-making space.\n\nJudge:\nBut this isn't -- I guess my point is, even if we decided that this wasn't a sex-based classification that triggered intermediate scrutiny, that would not prevent parents from still asserting the substantive due process right.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes, yes, of course.\n\nI agree with that.\n\nI do think that the sex-based classification under Equal Protection Clause is the most straightforward way to think about what's going on here, though.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nThanks.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Jackson?\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I'm glad that you've clarified that how we characterize this law is really the issue on the table today, not the risks or benefits or the policies that justify it but how we characterize it.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "2", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-824, United States versus Miller.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Bankruptcy Code grants trustees an array of avoidance powers, including the power to avoid fraudulent transfers under Section 548, subject to a two-year federal lookback period. This trustee's claim is time-barred, so he's relied on a different code provision, Section 544(b).\n\nBut 544(b) has no application here. That provision looks to whether a real-world creditor can avoid a transfer under state law with a longer lookback period.\n\nRather than leave that right to one creditor, Congress authorized the trustee to pull it into bankruptcy to benefit all creditors.\n\nBut 544(b) doesn't come into play unless a transfer is already voidable under state law; 544(b) simply allows the trustee to piggyback off that existing vulnerability.\n\nIn practice, that means 544(b) has a two-level structure.\n\nThe trustee must first identify a creditor with the right to avoid the transfer under state law.\n\nIf so, he can step into the creditor's shoes and avoid the same transfer under 544(b).\n\nBut, if not, he has no one's shoes to step into and he can't use 544(b) to circumvent the code's two-year lookback period.\n\nHere, any creditor's attempt to avoid these federal taxes under state law would obviously be barred by sovereign immunity and other obstacles.\n\nThe trustee's parallel 544(b) action should therefore fail on the merits.\n\nPlaintiff's main argument is that Section 106(a) alters that analysis.\n\nBut 106(a) waives immunity at the federal level for 59 bankruptcy code provisions.\n\n106(a) plainly does not waive immunity for a state law claim outside bankruptcy.\n\nAnd 106(a) likewise does --makes clear that it does not alter the substance of the identified code provisions.\n\nRather, it waives immunity so that those provisions can be applied to sovereigns according to their terms. And, here, 544(b) by its terms allows a trustee to avoid a transfer if and only if a creditor could avoid that transfer outside bankruptcy.\n\nNothing in 106(a) alters that requirement.\n\nThe trustee's contrary theory misreads 106(a), and it misses the basic design of 544(b).\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge:\nCould 106 be written in a way that you can get around the immunity problem at the merits level under 544?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think it could be, and I think the way you would do it would be to say something like, in actions under the identified sections, governmental units should be treated like private parties in like circumstances.\n\nThere actually is an analogous bar -- provision like that in the code under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nCongress did write something like that to make sure that the United States could be liable under state tort law under the terms set forth in that Act.\n\nBut I think that sort of bakes in this idea that Congress would have wanted that result, that Congress would have wanted the United States to be liable under a provision like 544(b) on the merits.\n\nAnd that goes to the fundamental premise of 544(b), which is that 544(b) exists in the code in order to mirror liability that exists outside of bankruptcy.\n\nAnd I don't think there's any reason to think that Congress would have wanted to expose the IRS to liability under state law through a provision that only does what already exists outside of bankruptcy.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, what federal causes of action, besides maybe the FDCPA, might a trustee be able to assert via 544(b)?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's probably the best example of what the trustee could assert vis-a-vis 544(b), but, usually, 544(b) isn't used against the federal government, which I think is where -- I take it that --\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- that's where you're going with this.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nBut we don't think that's a problem with our interpretation because 106(a) waives immunity as to 59 sections by section, not by subsection, and the waiver has an important role to play as to 544(a) vis-a-vis the United States.\n\nAnd that's because, under 544(a), waiving immunity allows the United States -- allows the trustee to prime a tax lien against the United States if it's not properly filed.\n\nAnd that can have a huge consequence for the distribution of the estate to unsecured creditors.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I was just -- okay. There's just one more.\n\nJudge:\nLet me ask you that just about states. It's a slightly different question but kind of the same realm.\n\nThe state amici say that if we construe this -- if we -- if we construe it as the trustee wants, it's going to raise a constitutional question about whether Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity under the bankruptcy clause. Is Katz your answer to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think Katz is the answer to that, but I also don't think that anything in this case requires the Court to reach that constitutional question.\n\nI think there are various ways in which the code brings in state law, and as long as it brings in state law uniformly, in general, that is sufficient.\n\nBut, here, the problem isn't that there's some constitutional obstacle to bringing in state law.\n\nIt's that the way in which 544(b) operates is only to bring in state law when that transfer was already vulnerable under state law. So it's a problem on the merits.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nMs. [Lawyer of Defendant], I actually wanted to follow up on the first question that Justice [Judge] asked you, and I -- I understand your response is that the waiver in 106 will still do work with respect to 544(a) even if it does no work with respect to 544(b).\n\nIs that the gist of your answer?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWith a small correction. It does -- definitely does work as to the United States with respect to 544(a).\n\nIt also does work with respect to any sovereign that has exposed itself to state law outside of bankruptcy, and some states have done that under 544(b).\n\nJudge:\nSure. Okay. But 106 waives sovereign immunity for the federal government with respect to all of 544. It doesn't single out (a).\n\nAnd I think the gist of your argument is that, as you read 544(b), 106 is effectively rendered a nullity.\n\nWhat's your response to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSure. So two points on that.\n\nThe first point is that the way that 106 operates with respect to 544(b) is defined by the limitation in 106(a) and the nature of 544(b).\n\nSo 106(a) is a waiver of immunity as to those 59 code provisions that you referenced, but it specifically says in 106(a)(5) that nothing in this section shall create any substantive claim for relief that doesn't otherwise exist.\n\nJudge:\nNo, it doesn't create a new cause of action.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo it says both that it doesn't create any substantive claim for relief and it doesn't create any new cause of action. But, critically, that takes us to 544(b), which is, what does 544(b) do? And 544(b), what it does is it says that the trustee can mirror an existing state law right.\n\nJudge:\nIf I understand what you're saying -- and I'll let you go in a second --", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1005", "dialogue": "Judge: Exactly.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, I mean, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of borderline cases, but I don't think this is -- this is one.\n\nJudge: I --\n\nJudge: And let me just ask you one question about how this scheme works because I agree it's very odd.\n\nIs there some mechanism when you're before this intermediate tribunal where you actually fill out a piece of paper and say, I'm asserting a due process claim in addition to my claim for benefits? How would one even exhaust the due process portion of this?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So I've been wondering that too.\n\nI mean, maybe you can just go back right now to the appeals tribunal and, like, file, like, a 28(j) letter saying, hey, enough time has passed; you know, there's a due process violation.\n\nI don't -- I don't know if there's any procedural mechanism to do that that I'm aware of, but that does seem to be what the state court is requiring here.\n\nJudge: I came into this case thinking that perhaps there wasn't a great deal at stake since a plaintiff like your plaintiffs could always file in federal court and avoid the exhaustion requirement by doing that.\n\nBut what you just said in response to the previous question makes me think that this could be much more important because, if we are going to read into the general rule that state courts can define their jurisdiction, what we have done in determining whether federal statutes are jurisdictional, which is pretty much to say, boy, it's really hard for us to conclude that anything is jurisdictional, then you are really asking for a significant weakening of this general rule which has been a -- a -- a landmark rule for hundreds of years.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So I'm not sure the Court should engage in the sort of statutory interpretation of state statutes that it would engage in for federal statutes.\n\nThat's not the rule we're asking for, all right? We're not quarreling with the state court that, as a matter of state law, this is a jurisdictional statute.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nFine.\n\nAll right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay? What we're just saying is that not all jurisdictional rules are created alike for purposes of federal law, and that distinction might sort of match the jurisdictional versus claim processing type of distinction that this Court has articulated --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- in federal cases.\n\nJudge: And are you saying that, assuming this is a state jurisdictional rule, it cannot or can be preempted? What is -- I thought this case was about preemption, not about the characterization of the state law.\n\nSo, if we agree and assume that the state law is jurisdictional, what implication for whether or not it can be preempted by federal law?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: In this case, I think there's no implications.\n\nIt's preempted regardless of whether it's jurisdictional.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because this Court has held as far back as, like, the Mondou case in 1912 that a state court cannot decline jurisdiction over a federal claim because of a disagreement with -- with the federal policy allowing the claim to proceed.\n\nAnd I think that's what's happening in this case.\n\nThe state has the view that exhaustion is a good idea, and it has imposed that by statute.\n\nBut Congress has decided that that's not the case, that you should be able to bring 1983 claims without having to exhaust.\n\nAnd so the rule --\n\nJudge: And so it's a Supremacy Clause issue in terms of whether or not that has to be the outcome?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\n\nI think the rule of decision applied by the state court in this case is inconsistent with the rule of decision that Section 1983 requires the state court to adopt.\n\nSo I think there's just direct preemption in that way.\n\nWe're not disagreeing with the purpose and objectives analysis in Felder.\n\nWe agree with that too.\n\nBut I think there's an even more straightforward way to get to the same outcome.\n\nJudge: Put aside Felder. What is the problem with just going to federal court?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, we could have gone to federal court, but there's a lot of cases from this Court.\n\nI won't mention Felder, but there's a lot of other cases --\n\nJudge: Well, what is the real-world problem with just going to federal court? Or maybe there aren't any and you're just saying precedent says we can go to state court.\n\nBut do you have any real-world problems with just going to federal court?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah, I think there's a lot of reasons that you would want to go to state court.\n\nSo, first of all, the Pennhurst doctrine sometimes prohibits plaintiffs from bringing state law claims in federal court. Federal courts also often talk -- have abstention doctrines that prohibit bringing the claim in federal court.\n\nThere's a -- there's a brief from two religious freedom organizations that talks about the abstention doctrines in some detail.\n\nAlso, there's practical concerns. Like, in some cases, lawyers would just be more familiar with the local state court.\n\nThe vast majority of unemployment insurance litigation in this state happens in state court.\n\nAnd so, if a lawyer may be more familiar with that tribunal, they may spend their entire career practicing in state court, and if they have a civil rights claim from a claimant, then it makes sense for them to go to state court.\n\nJudge: And you mentioned this earlier, but a procedural due process claim usually requires that you go through the state processes first.\n\nMaybe that's how this case got on the -- on the wrong track.\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: In general, yes.\n\nI think that if you went to federal court and asserted your due process claim without exhausting, you'd usually lose, except in an unusual case like this, where you're actually challenging the inability to exhaust.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nI want to make sure I have your complete answer to the line of questioning I -- I understood was being pursued, I mean -- and I think why you called this Kafkaesque, which is because you're being told you have to go to the state -- your -- your claim is the state doesn't handle these things in a timely fashion, they lose the papers, you can't answer the phone, so why send them back? If you have to go back there, that's -- your whole point is you -- you -- you can't go back there because they do such a -- that's what you're challenging.\n\nAnd I just want to make sure whether -- if you had the most efficient state procedure imaginable, you know, they answer the phone on the first ring and they quickly give -- you a decision, would your argument be the same, that it doesn't matter?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: It would be the same.

{"id": "746", "dialogue": "Judge: So I just want to clarify one thing because I've seen cases in which the indictment has many counts talking about different acts of the defendant and uses the kind of language that points to \"on or about\" a certain date. In some of them, those counts even have overlapping dates and time frames.\n\nAnd so I guess I would expect that it would be those kinds of cases in which the defendant would have a colorable argument that these things happened on the same occasion, and those would be the ones that would be more likely to go to trial, right?\n\nI mean, it's—I guess I'm—I'm suggesting that the trial scenario seems to me to be precisely the one where you would have to bring in all the evidence related to the past crime because if it was just as easy as, you know, these things are on separate dates, the person probably wouldn't go to trial, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I—I do think that—again, we don't have a ton of experience with this.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But I do think that to the extent that the indictments for the prior crimes or the information for the prior crimes, the charging documents, show that they occurred on different days or at least allow a jury to infer as much, I'm not sure that the defendant, in the absence of some plausible argument—and, again, I think that's going to be the rare case, and precedent suggests it's the rare case—in the absence of a plausible argument that they're part of a common scheme, not just a common motivation like \"I'm an inveterate gambler and I need to rob stores to make my money,\" but an actual part of a common scheme, that the defendant's actually going to want to go to trial on that.\n\nBecause, you know, among other things, like, lots of cases plead, and the defendant may not—for—for—may not wish to kind of try the district court's patience with holding separate proceedings on something—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —that's not going to benefit him.\n\nJudge: All right.

If we look at the facts here and we say this is harmless because, fill in the blank, that would then become a rule that I would assume would have to be incorporated into future jury instructions in order to make sure we have some sort of uniformity coming out of this, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It would depend on what— it would depend on what the court said.\n\nI—I don't know that we would invariably, even under the current precedent, insist that the jury be instructed that, for example, different days almost always mean separate occasions.\n\nI think we're comfortable enough with kind of a description of the general inquiry—\n\nJudge: But it doesn't bother the government that you could have a jury that is—you could have different defendants who basically got the same rap sheets coming out differently, unless we have a rule about when it's going to be treated as a different occasion?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That does bother us, Your Honor.\n\nWe always want like defendants to be treated alike.\n\nThat's a basic—a basic animating principle of sentencing law and sentencing in general.\n\nAnd to the extent we can, we would want jury instructions that would tend to reach that conclusion. However, as this court has noted, for example, in past cases, different juries, even instructed the exact same way—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —can come out different ways on similar facts. That's just—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —the nature of the system.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Defense, you may proceed.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the court: The legal standard requires judges to make a classic recidivism determination, a finding about the separateness of prior offenses.\n\nUnder this court's precedents, that legislative choice is consistent with the Constitution.\n\nThis court held, based on centuries-old sentencing practices, that judges can impose sentencing enhancements based on recidivism.\n\nFor decades, the federal courts of appeals have unanimously upheld judicial fact-finding under this standard, and states also have relied on it to enact and enforce similar state recidivism schemes.\n\nBoth the plaintiff and the government seek to upend this practice, but they don't offer a principled basis for doing so.\n\nTheir front-line position is that judges can find only the elements of prior offenses.\n\nBut they concede that precedent authorizes judges to find various non-elemental facts as well.\n\nSo they're forced to make exception after exception to their elements-only principle, and they ultimately land on standards that are inconsistent with one another and divorced from any constitutional principle or precedent of this court.\n\nI think what this court's precedents show is that judges can find facts about prior offenses, whereas juries must find facts about present offenses.\n\nBut, even if the other side's approaches were correct, the court should still affirm because at least the government agrees that judges applying the law can find facts about the dates and locations of prior offenses, and those very same facts are going to resolve most of these questions, as this case illustrates.\n\nIt would make no sense to allow judges to find those facts under one clause of the law but not the other.\n\nThis court should not set aside decades of consensus and impose on all federal and state courts an untested recidivism regime that would gravely prejudice defendants.\n\nI welcome the court's questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, what's your best historical evidence that judges have performed inquiries like the different occasions inquiry here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor.\n\nI—I want to flag upfront that I don't think the—the right question is to ask whether there are direct historical analogues.\n\nBut, to answer your question directly first, I do think that the statutes that have been mentioned about sequencing, going back to the early 1800s, finding that an offense occurred after a prior conviction, that an offense occurred after a defendant escaped or was released from prison, I think those are quite analogous to this standard.\n\nI think, at bottom, in most cases, this standard is essentially asking judges to make a decision about sequencing—about how prior offenses occurred, whether they occurred one after another.\n\nAnd I do think these statutes that, again, go back to the early 1800s are quite similar in that regard.\n\nI do want to say, though, I don't think that that's the right historical question.\n\nI think the way the court should think about the historical inquiry here is to ask, at the time of the founding, was there a settled practice that legislatures had to treat recidivism as an element of the offense?\n\nAnd I think the answer to that question is no, as precedent has recognized.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "378", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-250, Becerra versus the Apache Tribe.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Indian Self-Determination Act requires the Indian Health Service to enter into contracts with tribes to transfer federal health programs that IHS previously carried out for the tribes' benefit.\n\nISDA's basic design is simple. IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have otherwise spent on the federal program and transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange for the tribe's promise to use them to provide the same level of services, and ISDA obligates IHS to add to that core secretarial amount contract support costs to plug specific gaps the secretarial amount does not cover.\n\nWhat the tribes are arguing here is that ISDA also obligates IHS to subsidize the tribes' expenditures of funds that they don't receive from IHS under the contract but, rather, collect from third parties as supplemental revenue.\n\nThe statutory text and context refute that theory, which would upend how the statute has been administered for 35 years.\n\nISDA's provisions addressing contract support costs say nothing about third-party revenue a tribe may earn.\n\nISDA deals with that separate income stream in other provisions, including one instructing that such income shall be treated as supplemental funding to that in the contract.\n\nThe tribes' argument that Congress actually intended for such income to determine what IHS pays under the contract would work a sea change in ISDA's scheme by potentially tripling the federal government's contract support cost obligation and eventually transforming what the statute designates as mere support costs into the primary component of contract funding.\n\nBut there is an even more straightforward reason why the tribes' theory here is wrong.\n\nIt violates Congress's express command that IHS only reimburse costs that are directly attributable to the tribes' ISDA contract.\n\nThat prohibition applies notwithstanding any other provision of law and would independently bar the agency from paying the costs at issue here even if they might otherwise qualify.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Are there limitations on how the tribe can use the outside income—the additional income?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There are two—\n\nJudge: What's that limitation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, there, it says they have to use it to further the general purposes of the contract.\n\nJudge: Well, if that's the case, I guess their argument is then it is a part of the contract?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They have an argument that because all of ISDA Title I is incorporated via a cross-reference in the authority section of the model contract, that that provision is incorporated.\n\nBut that provision also has to be read consistent with the provision of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n\nAnd that governs the same reimbursement income and says tribes just have to use it \"for any healthcare-related purpose\" or otherwise defer to the purposes of that law, which include things as varied as including the presence of tribal members in healthcare professions.\n\nSo it is a very open-ended limitation that is not limited to just providing additional contract services.\n\nJudge: Well, under your approach, a tribe is worse off if the more they undertake in the direction of self-determination, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I would—\n\nJudge: In terms of funding, they are undertaking more healthcare responsibilities and getting a smaller percentage of the money back from the government.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I would respectfully disagree with that, Your Honor.\n\nI believe you're referencing the mathematical hypothesis that the tribes have offered in their brief saying that there is what they call a self-determination penalty.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But that assumes that IHS, when it's running its own program, and the tribes are earning the same amount of third-party income.\n\nAnd there are ways that Congress has built flexibilities into the statute to enable tribes to earn more third-party reimbursement income in the first instance and have greater flexibility to spend it so as to leverage it to build their programs in ways that IHS cannot.\n\nJudge: Well, how is that? I mean, they're getting more Medicare, Medicaid financing that they can then use, but under the interpretation of the government, they're not reimbursed for that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, they're earning more in the first instance, for instance, because tribes running their own programs can unilaterally decide to serve non-Indians and other noneligible beneficiaries.\n\nIHS—\n\nJudge: But what about the tribes that don't want to do that? I mean, I think you said that maybe half the tribes serve non-Indians, but the other half don’t and, presumably, have decided that they don't want to.\n\nAnd then the question would apply in full force.\n\nThey're getting less because they've gone the independent route.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that Congress gave them that flexibility so that they could grow their programs that way.\n\nBut the other ways in which IHS is differently situated is that IHS can't use Medicaid and Medicare proceeds, which are the bulk of the proceeds that we're talking about, to spend on new construction of new facilities.\n\nTribes can.\n\nThat can enable the tribes to grow their programs and bring in more third-party income.\n\nJudge: But is that really so different? I mean, presumably, the tribes also have to make sure they're compliant with Medicare and Medicaid, so, presumably, they're having to put money into the same things.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I believe Congress thought it was a difference when they deliberately exempted the tribes from that requirement and said that they can prioritize other uses of these funds, including program expansion.\n\nJudge: But they have to make sure that the Medicare and the Medicaid monies keep flowing in, and for those monies to keep flowing in, they have to be compliant with the program terms.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, but they have a sort of accounting and prioritization flexibility that IHS does not have.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I had thought that a lot changed after 2010 and the tribes became payor of last resort under Obamacare, and so they've taken on a lot more obligations here.\n\nIs that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The payor of last resort provision means that when there are different available sources of funds, the tribes or the IHS program is—\n\nJudge: Is the payor of last resort?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: So they have to collect it, and then the question is how they spend it.\n\nAnd (m)(1) says it has to be consistent with the general purposes of the contract.\n\nAnd the contracts are specific about what services they provide, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: So the general purpose of the contract is Indian health, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, I agree with that.\n\nJudge: And Indian health, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: And it's even more specifically limited by the particular services that tribes have contracted to provide, like, for example, in one of the cases, EMS services, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I agree with that, but—\n\nJudge: So, if you do agree with that, then what's the problem here?\n\nBecause it would seem that the contract support services that would be required to be paid from the government would be limited, A, by the general purpose of the contract, which is Indian health, and B, by the specific services that the government has contracted to allow the tribes to provide.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I would not fight Your Honor on imposing that limitation if you were to say that there is some additional contract support cost obligation tied to third-party reimbursement.\n\nJudge: Would that take care of all the government's concerns about the money being used for non-Indian healthcare?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "270", "dialogue": "Judge: So I only agree that the existence and formation part of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong. I do not view that part of what they said as what controlled their analysis.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, if you look carefully at their opinion, they have two headings, delegation clause and arbitration or whatever the second heading was. But they have a heading for delegation clause. Under that, the defendant had argued that, well, this is a dispute about the scope of the arbitration agreement, and, therefore, that's the end of the analysis. It must go to the arbitrator.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Ninth Circuit said: Wait a minute, we're going to actually ask whether that scope language was intended to apply to a future contract like this one that says court only, that has a different set of parties.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So -- so all that to say, they did directly address the delegation question before reaching arbitrability. And that's correct under Henry Schein.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And they also, in addressing delegation, the question they answered is, is this delegation clause intended to be applicable to this arbitrability dispute? And that's -- that's one correct question to ask under Granite Rock because arbitration is always dispute-specific.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It's -- we can't just label this an arbitrability dispute and move on. We can't do that because it's also a forum dispute. It's also in substance a dispute about the official rules.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We don't actually agree about the scope of the user agreements. We disagree about the scope of the official rules of the June 2021 sweepstakes. How is that not a controversy regarding the sweepstakes as to arbitrability? It's about the arbitrability of the sweepstakes.\n\nJudge: Do you think --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And that was intended for the courts.\n\nJudge: -- do you think that the Ninth Circuit decided whether the official rules supplant the original arbitration agreement's delegation clause?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. And that -- that's where I think they went wrong if anywhere.\n\nJudge: So that -- so -- so you think that this is not like, oh, they just forgot to put in a sentence. You think that they never addressed that question?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They stopped at the question before it, which is, look, we don' t even have to reach the official rules because we're just looking at the clause, the delegation clause, and we're looking at the arbitrability dispute and we're saying we don't think this was meant to cover this.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And -- and that's an applicability decision that is delegation-specific. That's not preempted by the FAA.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They haven't -- they haven't addressed it at all. They haven't addressed it under state law. They haven't addressed it under federal law.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: There's actually -- they just want to focus on this existence language so that they can go back and down and say, hey, this existence rule no longer exists, and, by the way, that was your excuse to apply state law. Now you have to apply the presumption in favor of arbitrability.\n\nJudge: I think you just gave away your case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, no, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Your -- your -- they came in saying vacate and remand because they didn't address delegation and whether the -- the user agreement -- the sweepstakes agreement superseded that.\n\nJudge: And you're saying the Ninth Circuit didn't do that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right. And -- and in my view, they didn't necessarily have to because they asked whether the delegation clause was applicable to this arbitrability dispute about the sweepstakes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They -- they looked at the delegation clause and they said: This wasn’t intended to cover this particular arbitrability dispute. And so they said it's not delegated.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But, to -- to some of the Justices' point, if we look at just the language of the delegation clause, it's broad enough to cover any arbitrability dispute.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the safer, better way to address this delegation question is were the official rules intended --or -- or did the rules have the effect of modifying the delegation clause as to these types of arbitrability disputes?\n\nJudge: I -- I -- I -- I just -- I'm struggling.\n\nJudge: I -- I certainly see the argument that the second agreement modifies where this thing should go and should be resolved and by whom ultimately.\n\nJudge: But I think you've just conceded over and over again that the first agreement says those questions go to the arbitrator and it's broad in scope and it covers everything, all relationships with the defendant.\n\nJudge: So you want us to vacate and remand for more proceedings in the Ninth Circuit on whether that first agreement modifies the second rather than just going to get an answer from the arbitrator.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I mean, remand is not our -- our first request. Our first request is to affirm the judgment and -- and just make clear that that \"existence\" language isn't the way to go about it.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The way to go about it is ask whether the parties intended the delegation clause to apply to this arbitrability dispute.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And as -- I mean, I could give you a long, economic, strategic answer --\n\nJudge: Well, I'm kind of --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- for why we're --\n\nJudge: -- kind of curious, I admit.\n\nJudge: I mean, this is about a sweepstakes, you know, entry.\n\nJudge: And how much money is at stake? And why are we litigating all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States up and down and up and down over where this goes when, frankly, I would have thought you had a really good shot of getting an arbitrator to say this belongs in court.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I would agree, but -- but that wasn't -- that wasn't the -- we don't want to take this to an arbitrator.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And they don't -- they don't care where it goes. We care where it goes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But they don't care where the -- they don't care who decides arbitrability. They just care where the case ends up.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We've already won the issue in court of where the case ends up, so we don't want it to go to an arbitrator now to review the Ninth Circuit's arbitrability decision.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I'm just answering the question of why are we here.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nJudge: I mean, because you think an arbitrator will be less likely to send it to court? Is that the reason why you're here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, we -- what we have right now is a hundred percent certainty. And if an arbitrator is reviewing it, it's less than a hundred percent certainty.\n\nJudge: How much money are you seeking in your complaint for this sweepstakes entry thing?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So it -- I mean, at the time we filed, we didn't know. At the time we filed, all we knew is that entrants were manipulated into being -- into paying $100 per person or more to -- to enter the sweepstakes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We are left to estimate, you know, how -- how many people were affected by that.\n\nJudge: It's a class action, putative, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Putative.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Is there -- was there something precluding the State of Texas from moving to intervene in this case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, other than, Your Honor, they asked for our participation, I don't --\n\nJudge\nNo, I understand.\n\nI understand what you actually did.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nI'm just saying, you say there's no meaningful judicial review.\n\nAnd I'm just wondering, if there is an avenue for you to become a party with the requisite degree of formality, say, by requesting intervention, was there a reason why you couldn't have done that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nSo I would go back to what Mr. Stewart said earlier, which is, even for states, you have to have an admissible contention.\n\nAnd the argument that we were making was the exact same argument Sierra Club made, and they said that's not an admissible contention.\n\nI would point the Court to 10 C.F.R. 2.335, which is their procedure if they wanted to screen out these types of things, which essentially says, if you think you're operating outside of -- if we were operating outside of the law, well, then you have to file a petition for rulemaking.\n\nThat is not meaningful judicial review.\n\nJudge\nGeneral --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nThat is not how judicial review works.\n\nJudge\nGeneral, I take your point that if this were a rulemaking, you'd be a party.\n\nI get that.\n\nI also understand the instinct that adjudications are sometimes different, though I know this Court has held that objecting shareholders in a class action suit are parties for purposes of appeal even though they haven't intervened.\n\nWhere should we look to understand what the Hobbs Act meant by the term \"party?\"\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSure.\n\nI mean, one, I would say let's look at the dictionary.\n\nBoth parties point the Court to the 1951 Black's Law Dictionary.\n\nLook at the big text, not the little text underneath that they rely on.\n\nLook at the big front-line text that he uses in the 1951 Black's Law Dictionary.\n\nI would say there. But I'd also say whatever you say \"party\" means for Hobbs Act purposes, it has to be big enough to include rulemaking because it's the very same word.\n\nJudge\nYeah, we've never said that you have to intervene to be a party. And that was not the case at common law.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nCorrect, Your Honor. And I would also -- again, this is back on the Tenth Circuit days, you wrote a decision in In re Wolseley --\n\nJudge\nOh, gosh.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- where the court -- where -- I thought it was a wonderful opinion.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd the court explained --\n\nJudge\nI wish I could remember it.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd the court explained the Clark v.

One is 10155(h), which we've been talking about, which is inexplicable under their theory, but also 10131(a)(3), where Congress said in its findings -- paraphrasing here -- we are unhappy with what has happened before.\n\nYou don't see that very often from Congress, but Congress said we are displeased with what has happened before. And then you go on to 10155(h), which says keep it onsite.\n\nJudge\nMr. Nielson, if spent nuclear fuel is not the same as the three constituent parts, why did ISP need a license at all?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nSo I think this is where -- a couple answers.\n\nOne, I agree with -- with Mr. Frederick that the answer is the licensing of the facility.\n\nYou have to have a safe facility, so you have to have some way to keep the very, very, very hot nuclear waste safe.\n\nBut the other is -- is physics.\n\nIf you have a license to take some sort of product or -- or material onto a facility and you have a license to use that facility, but you have no license to take it off the facility, you know, per Newton, it stays where it is.\n\nJudge\nNo, I'm just asking about --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd that --\n\nJudge\n-- I'm asking about the statutory possession requirement.\n\nI thought you had to have a license to possess this kind of material and its -- the constituent parts, and everybody has believed that that equals spent nuclear fuel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "625", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 22-529, Cantero versus Bank of America.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 25b preempts a state consumer financial law only if, as relevant here, it prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise of a national bank's powers. Bank of America argues and the Second Circuit held that this statute preempts any law that controls or otherwise hinders the exercise of a national bank's powers, regardless of whether the law has any significant effect on such powers.\n\nThis test conflicts with the statute for four reasons.\n\nFirst, Section 25b's definition of \"state consumer financial law\" is incompatible with the control test because it would require that every such law be preempted, nullifying the statute and erecting the very field preemption regime that the statute forbids.\n\nBank of America's only retort is to concede that state fair lending laws aren't categorically preempted, a concession it doesn't explain and that disproves its own test.\n\nSecond, the control test ignores Section 25b's express codification of Barnett Bank's \"prevents or significantly interferes with\" standard and, in particular, the word \"significantly,\" which Bank of America reads out of the statute.\n\nThird, a control test can't be squared with Section 25b's provisions for OCC preemption determinations, which must assess the impact of a state law and be based on substantial evidence. These requirements would make no sense if a control test were the law.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most fundamentally, adopting a control test would require reading virtually all of Section 25b to have no real-world effect.\n\nWith no plausible textual argument, Bank of America turns to policy, claiming that its test is needed to avoid mayhem. But Congress disagreed, and Section 25b has a solution to this concern. The OCC can make the preemption determinations contemplated by the statute. That it has thus far failed to respect the statute's commands grants no license to this Court to do the same.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: I'd be interested in you giving us your explanation as to how Barnett Bank gives us guidance as to how to interpret \"prevents or significantly interferes.\"\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure, Justice. So Barnett Bank uses the \"prevents or significantly interferes with\" standard as a kind of distillation of the rule that emerges from this Court's cases.\n\nNow, of course, the conflict that was at issue in Barnett Bank was a stark conflict. It involved a state statute that said banks may not do X and a federal statute that said national banks may do X, and this Court was able to resolve that as a clear conflict.\n\nBut it didn't give much guidance itself in terms of what \"significant interferes with\" means, but it did articulate that as the standard that emerges from this Court's cases. And the first case that it cited was this Court's decision in Anderson.\n\nAnd Anderson involved a Kentucky escheat law, and the Court in that case—there was a preemption challenge that was brought to that statute by the national bank, and the Court in that case said that's not a discriminatory statute.\n\nIt was the first question the Court asked. It doesn't conflict with any statutory text, and so we examine the law's practical effect.\n\nAnd in examining the law's practical effect, it distinguished a prior decision from this Court that reached the opposite outcome. And the only way to explain that pair of cases is that the Court examined the practical effect.\n\nAnd so I think the one thing that we know of the \"prevents or significantly interferes with\" standard and what it means is that it requires an examination at a minimum of the practical effect of the statute.\n\nAnd that's clear from the ordinary meaning of the phrase, and it's confirmed by the surrounding text in Section 25b, including the provision that requires that the OCC examine the law's impact based on substantial evidence—\n\nJudge: And what does it—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —and periodically review.\n\nJudge: —and what exactly does it mean to examine the practical effect? I mean, why don't you talk about this law and say how an analysis of that kind would work with respect to this law and then maybe say anything more general you want, because it seems to provide no guidance at all to courts as to what they have to do.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah, I will answer that question directly, but I will say that because of the way that Bank of America has argued the case and the way that the Second Circuit decided the case, the only question that this Court has to confront is whether the control test is codified as part of Section 25b or whether, instead, courts must look to the practical effect of the law.\n\nJudge: I appreciate that, but one thing that we should think about at least in considering whether the practical effect test that you're suggesting is the one that's codified and is the appropriate one—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mm-hmm. Sure.\n\nJudge: —is what would that—what would that mean? What would it look like? And then we can, you know, consider whether that's what Congress had in mind.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. So it might look like the showing that the national bank made in Franklin National Bank, for example, and I would recommend that you look at the trial court decision in that case.\n\nSo that case involved a federal statute that granted to national banks the authority to accept savings deposits.\n\nAnd New York had a statute that didn't prohibit national banks from accepting savings deposits but disabled them from using the word \"savings\" in their business operation and in their advertisements or any equivalent thereof and reserved to certain state institutions the privilege to use that word.\n\nAnd what the national bank said in that case, it identified real-world evidence showing the tremendous extent to which that law served as an obstacle to it attempting to accept savings deposits in its business operations, and the trial court in that case found what is effectively significant interference.\n\nAnd by the time that case got to this Court, this Court, although it resolved its question before it based on statutory construction grounds, emphasizing the statute, the federal statute's use of the word \"savings,\" I think it had confidence based on the record before it that that word mattered in the real world.\n\nJudge: And if that standard had been used here, what would that have meant? What evidence would the parties have put on, and how would the court have addressed the issue?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the legal question would be whether there's significant interference. And we think that looks to the practical effect, and Bank of America would have to identify what the practical effect is.\n\nI think it would be particularly easy for it to do so here because we have a statute that's been on the books for 50 years.\n\nState banks have been complying with it. Most federal banks, it's my understanding, have been complying with it.\n\nAnd, indeed, there was a preemption challenge that was immediately brought, and it failed, and, presumably, national banks were complying with it after that.\n\nAnd so they could look at the data showing the extent to which this minimum interest requirement has caused banks to not offer mortgage escrow services to—which would be the relevant power—to consumers.\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And to—\n\nJudge: Keep going. Sorry.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And I think it would just be a question of degree at that point.\n\nAnd I would concede that it's not a bright-line test. Congress didn't want a bright-line test. It had before it various proposals that would have been a bright-line test, including field preemption.\n\nThat's administrable, but we know that Congress didn't want that.\n\nAnd on the other hand, the Department of the Treasury submitted a proposal that would have made preemption determinations turn entirely on whether the law is discriminatory.\n\nThat's also administrable, but in the judgment of Congress, that didn't go far enough to provide protection to the banks, and Congress wanted to give banks, as an accommodation, the opportunity on a case-by-case basis to show that there's significant interference.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

For decades, women couldn't hold licenses as butchers or as lawyers because legislatures thought that our -- that we weren't strong enough to pursue those occupations.\n\nAnd some -- some people rightly believe that gender dysphoria may cause -- may be changed by some -- in some children.\n\nBut the evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment, isn't there?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nYes.\n\nI think the evidence is uniform on that, whether you look at the standard of care, whether you look at the view of every major American medical association that has taken a position, many of whom are amici here.\n\nIt's reflected in the clinical practice.\n\nThe nation's leading children's hospitals for decades have been providing this care.\n\nJudge\nSome -- some children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, don't they?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nYes.\n\nIt's a very serious medical condition.\n\nJudge\nI think some attempt suicide?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nYes.\n\nThe rates of suicide are -- are striking --\n\nJudge\nSome --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\n-- and it's a vulnerable population.\n\nJudge\nDrug addiction is very high among some of these children because of their distress, correct?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nIt is a serious condition, yes.\n\nJudge\nOne of the Petitioners in this case described throwing up every day, going almost mute because of his -- because of their inability to speak in a voice that they could live with.\n\nThese are physically challenging situations as well too, correct?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nYes, that's correct.\n\nJudge\nAnd isn't the purpose of intermediate scrutiny, the level of scrutiny that we apply, necessary to ensure that whether it's legislatures or this Court, that we don't make those personal judgments but that we subject the judgments about these issues to a heightened review to ensure that those children who are going to suffer all of these consequences will be made to do so only when it's compellingly necessary?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nYes, in a circumstance where the state has an important interest.\n\nAnd we don't think that that means the states are entirely barred from regulating in this space.\n\nObviously, they are grappling with these issues in a variety of contexts, but you're right to say that when the state is using sex-based line-drawing, a court needs to look at that.\n\nAnd the problem with Tennessee's law here is not that it's just a little bit overinclusive or a little bit underinclusive but that it's a sweeping categorical ban where the legislature didn't even take into account the -- the significant health benefits that can come from providing gender-affirming care, including reduced suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and where the state leaves unregulated entirely access to these treatments in all other pediatric contexts where there's a similar risk/benefit trade-off.\n\nAnd for the families affected by this, Justice, these are -- are difficult decisions.\n\nObviously, anytime you're thinking about a medical intervention, you need to weigh risks and benefits.\n\nBut the State has come in here and, in a sharp departure from how it normally addresses this issue, it has completely decided to override the views of the parents, the patients, the doctors who are grappling with these decisions and trying to make those trade-offs.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nJustice Kagan?\n\nJudge\nGeneral, I wanted to get your thoughts first on why one should think of this as primarily a sex-based classification, because there's another way of looking at a law like this, maybe a more obvious way, which is that it's a classification based on transgender status.\n\nIn other words, there are trans young people on one side of the line and cis young people on the other side of the line, both male and female on both sides of the line.\n\nAnd why what is really going on here -- I -- I -- I understand the formal ways in which this is a sex-based classification, but I'm wondering whether that's not a little bit formal, and what's really going on here is a -- a -- a discrimination against, a disregard for, young people who are trans and why we shouldn't think of the law in that way.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nI think you can conceive of the law in that way, and we certainly do think that this law discriminates on the basis of transgender status, and that, likewise, should trigger heightened scrutiny, both because that's inherently a sex-based classification and because we think transgender status discrimination warrants heightened scrutiny in its own right.\n\nBut I don't think it's unduly formal to look at this as a sex classification, and the reason for that is because of the first operative provision of SB1, which says: You can't have these medications to live or identify in a manner inconsistent with your sex.\n\nThat is quintessentially imposing sex-based rules and expectations on adolescents in the state.\n\nAnd it's true it arises in the context of medical care for transgender youth, but, here, we think it's a very straightforward path for the Court to look at that and say: Well, in any other context, when you say you can't do something inconsistent with a protected characteristic, that's obviously classifying people on the basis of that characteristic.\n\nAnd, here, it wasn't accidental or -- or incidental.\n\nThis is threaded throughout the statutory scheme because the legislature was quite upfront that part of the interest here is in ensuring that minors appreciate their sex and not become disdainful of their sex, or, as Judge White put it in dissent below, that they look and live like boys and girls.\n\nAnd I think that adds on an additional layer of sex classification here insofar as it shows that part of what the State was attempting to do is ensure that adolescents conform their bodies to the State's physical expectations of how males and females should appear.\n\nIt's not at all surprising to think of that as a sex classification.\n\nJudge\nSo is what you're saying is that the two are just embedded in each other, or is what you're saying that sex stereotyping is built into our understandings of trans and cis classifications?\n\nOr, again, is it this more sort of logical analysis that might be found in an opinion like Bostock?\n\nAnd maybe those are not exclusive, but, you know, what's your sense of that?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nSo I think those aren't exclusive.\n\nI think they're reinforcing here.\n\nAnd I guess what I would say is I think this is an even easier sex classification than maybe the one the Court confronted in Bostock or the one the Court would confront if the statute simply discriminated on the basis of transgender status because, here, the legislature actually put the sex classification into the face of the law and made the first-order restriction here one that prohibits inconsistency with sex.\n\nAnd I'd just go back to the kinds of examples we give about dressing inconsistent with sex or pursuing a profession inconsistent with sex.\n\nYou know, I think the Court's recognition that that is a sex classification is obviously right, but it also can build in a layer of conformance with sex stereotypes that might be underlying those laws and that we think equally underlie this one.\n\nJudge\nLet me flip now to what it means to do heightened scrutiny in this area because, as you point out, this law and I think almost all of the similar -- or maybe all of the similar laws that have been passed like this allow this exact same kind of treatment for the opposite purpose, if you will, for, you know, a person -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a person born male who wants to get to puberty already.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer\nRight.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "380", "dialogue": "Judge: I have a few questions. Sorry. On the facts here, this defendant had nine prior felonies over a 13-year period.

You're on notice after even one not to possess firearms, and he had 16 long guns and four other guns in his garage, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's right, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. On the confession of error, I guess I thought of it a little differently than the previous question, because not one way or the other, but all the courts of appeals have rejected the confession of error, right, and ruled still for the government's original position?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's true, Your Honor, but we don't think that those holdings are viable. I mean, in some cases, they've just been waiting for this Court to itself announce that the syllogism I mentioned at the beginning is correct, because the Court expressly reserved the question in Wooden. In some cases, we think they're just reading the Almendarez-Torres exception too far, and in other cases, they're talking about prejudice to the defendant, which, first of all, we don't—we think is itself a manageable problem, but also, if you don't believe me, you—you can believe the defense bar, which is coming in on the Petitioner's side here.\n\nJudge: All right. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. Counsel, just a quick clarifying question. When you were going back and forth about how this would actually be done as a practical matter, you were asked about burden of proof, and I don't think you ever went back to it. I mean, in the old system, when judges were doing this, it was by a preponderance, I assume?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: The sentencing? So do you anticipate, which I took to be the thrust of the previous questions, that when juries are doing this beyond a reasonable doubt, do you think that the problems of proof would make it much more difficult to prove the predicates?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that it will do two things. It may well do two things. And, again, for reasons I've stated, this is kind of predictive. I—I do think it may incentivize defendants to submit this to a jury whereas they might not have before, and I don't know that that's necessarily a particularly beneficial thing as a practical matter because I think very rarely would it actually be the case that the defendant's three prior offenses were not committed on separate occasions.\n\nAnd, second, going before the jury, we might need to introduce different types of proof, or it may be harder to acquire everything that we might need. We'd prefer, as I said, not to have to bring the victim back in to say—\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —yes, I—I can remember, the—the date is stamped in my brain, you know, October 26th, that's a day I'll never forget because that's the day that that man robbed me, particularly if it's 10 years in the past and memories may have faded.\n\nIn fact, this kind of inquiry—or much more overruling Almendarez-Torres—would be a windfall for defendants who have a long rap sheet, as this defendant does here, but who—several of their crimes have been knocked out by various of this Court's or the court of appeals' decisions, and so we have to rely on some of the older crimes, for which it may be harder to produce this evidence or even to find every single state record that we might need, where there would otherwise be no dispute about it because the defendant knows quite well that he actually committed those offenses and what they were about.\n\nJudge: One other question. There were four trials the government has already conducted that were bifurcated. Same jury or was it a different jury?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I believe it was the same jury, Your Honor. I—I—I'm not—I'm not certain, but I don't see any reason why you'd need to swear in an entirely new jury and say, hello, here's the defendant, you know, here's what we've already determined.\n\nJudge: Sure.

{"id": "1031", "dialogue": "Judge: So this Court said in Meyer that the question of the cause of action and the question of the defense of sovereign immunity are analytically distinct. And that's the—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So then there's no implication on the basis of the cause of action.\n\nJudge: No, there can be implication. I know that I'm drawing fine lines, but, logically, there is an implication that Congress intends to waive sovereign immunity if it creates a cause of action that applies only to sovereign defendants or that expressly names sovereign defendants.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So it has to be explicit with respect to—it can't be that they do so by naming all these other entities and adding in government. Is that your point? It has to either be stand-alone just the word \"government\" in the \"person\" definition, or it has to be written \"government\" in the actual 1618n?\n\nJudge: Yes, because that is the only circumstance in which the statutory text that refers to \"government\" would have no effect if the government were able to assert sovereign immunity.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And where have we said that before?\n\nJudge: So I read the Court's decision in Financial Oversight and Management Board to say that. I think that's the only way that you can reconcile cases like Kimel on the one hand and Employees on the other, is to say that Congress distinguishes in this way.\n\nAnd if you look at statutes like RCRA and the MPRSA that we point to at pages 22 to 24 of our brief, Congress has done what we've said it could have done here. Congress has said it's authorizing suit against any person, comma, including the United States. We agree—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: All right.\n\nJudge: —that that gives rise to the implication.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Plaintiff’s Lawyer.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes civil liability on any person that negligently or willfully fails to comply with FCRA's requirements. It expressly defines \"person\" to include any government agency. The term \"person\" is equivalent to its definition, and when FCRA's definition of \"person\" is plugged into FCRA's civil liability provisions, those provisions create causes of action against federal agencies that are clear and specific enough to waive sovereign immunity.\n\nCongress was not required to state that \"persons\" include federal agencies a second time in the cause of action to make its intent clear. Congress knew what it was doing when it amended FCRA in 1996. When it did so, it consistently used the term \"person\" to describe both who would be subject to FCRA's substantive duties and who would be subject to FCRA's enforcement mechanisms.\n\nInterpreting \"person\" to mean something different in the enforcement provisions would make FCRA's substantive duties completely unenforceable against governmental furnishers.\n\nMoreover, Congress knew how to and did choose words to alter the scope of liability where it wanted to do so. Thus, where Section 1681n generally provides for damages against \"any person,\" 1681n[a][1][B] creates a special remedy for certain violations by a natural person. That was an amendment in 1996 as well.\n\nCongress also expressly limited the government's liability in FCRA's sister statute in the Consumer Credit Protection Act. It did not do so in FCRA, indicating that Congress intended no such limitation.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, there's much discussion about Employees, and I'd like you to address that, what the government argued, but I'd also like you to consider addressing whether or not what's necessary to—for the government to abrogate state sovereign immunity, whether that standard is the same as the standard for waiving its own sovereign immunity.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. So, on Employees, I think the best sort of empirical evidence of its continuing force are the five courts of appeals that have addressed this very issue, the question of whether FCRA waives sovereign immunity. That—there's a 3-2 circuit split on that. The government has raised Employees in each one of those cases. Not one single court, not even the two that agree with the government's position, thought Employees was worth discussing. It's too out—I suggest that's because the analysis does not comport with how the Court reads statutes in the modern era.\n\nEmployees, as I read it, was telling Congress how to craft an amendment to make its intent clear. The modern—the sort of the current way the Court discerns congressional intent is to look at the provisions as a whole, the amending provisions, as well as the original provisions, and construe them together. And Employees is inconsistent with that.\n\nThe other thing to point—\n\nJudge: I'm sorry. I—I—I don't understand that, really, looking at Employees, because it relies on the text of the provision and says that because the addition of public employees—employers was in a separate definitional provision, that wasn't good enough.\n\nAnd then the dissent echoes your argument. The dissent says that it's the sheerest sort of ritualism to suggest that Congress excluded the states from 16[b] suits by not expressly referring to the states in 16[b]. In other words, the dissent was saying you're being too textualist, majority opinion, in—in how you're going about this.\n\nAnd the majority said—I read it as establishing a principle—well, we're going to draw the line here. If it's just in the definitional section, that's not good enough for a waiver.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: So Employees started off by looking at the legislative history to discern what Congress wanted to do when it amended the FLSA in 1966.\n\nJudge: The—the principle rested on the text. I mean, I acknowledge that then it went on to the legislative history. It might have had an even looser standard for waiver of sovereign immunity than we now apply. But, even under that looser standard, the Court said no, no waiver.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, the—the textual part of Employees—\n\nJudge: And so a fortiori—\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —you're in trouble if—if we take Employees seriously. At least I want you to respond to that.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. I—I do think the text—the textual part of Employees, which indicated the Court would find it surprising, I think that's the exact quote, if Congress chose to amend the FLSA but did not amend it in this way. Now the Court says that Congress does not have to use magic words and it doesn't have to use a magic structure, I would say, doesn't have to state its intent in any particular way.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But any such distinction is immaterial.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Imagine an expert took the stand and said: I believe the defendant in this case probably or maybe 80 percent of the time -- or maybe there's an 80 percent likelihood had the requisite mens rea. Obviously, Rule 704(b) would prohibit that testimony. And the testimony here is exactly the same.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It expresses an opinion, a probabilistic opinion instead of an absolute opinion, but an opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So that leaves the government's final objection, that Rule 704(b) should not be construed to prohibit what the government calls inferentially relevant testimony. And we agree with that proposition.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The rule that I'm advocating today has been employed by the Fifth Circuit for over 20 years, and it makes clear that modus operandi evidence, for example, things like drug traffic organizations use couriers to transport drugs across the border, that they -- that drugs are extremely valuable, are perfectly legitimate.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The rule in the Fifth Circuit is that testimony from which a jury might infer mens rea is perfectly permissible, but testimony that assigns a mens rea to the defendant or people in her class is not okay. And that's what Agent Flood did here, and for that reason, we'd ask the Court to reverse.\n\nJudge: You put quite a bit of weight in your argument on the preposition \"about.\" And that was a stylistic change, certainly non-substantive. Do we normally put that much emphasis or that much weight on stylistic changes to statutes?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think what I would say, Your Honor, is the Court obviously puts a lot of weight on the text of the statute. And so I start with the current text of the statute that is current law.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, even with that, it says \"about defendant.\" It doesn't say \"about\" someone else. So you're saying that even if it's indirect, it's about this defendant?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Let me say two things, Your Honor. First, to finish my answer about the word \"about,\" what we say is that preposition is important, just like the prior preposition \"as to\" before the stylistic amendment.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because it makes clear the Ninth Circuit's clear statement rule requiring an explicit opinion is too narrow. So that's what the preposition \"about\" does.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Now you also asked me about \"the\" defendant. And our position there is very simple. It is that that word covers either a direct statement about the particular defendant or a statement about a class of people, including the defendant.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think the government disagrees that the rule covers a statement covering -- I'm sorry, that the rule covers a class of people including the defendant as long as it's stated in absolute terms.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought the argument there was that if you say \"all defendants,\" all people in this class do this, then it obviously would include the defendant.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's exactly right, Your Honor. So the only move left from there is to say, if the expert were to testify people like this almost always, virtually always, 99 percent of the time, probably, in most circumstances, all of those are still opinions about whether the defendant had the mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They're just not absolute opinions. But they're still stating an opinion about whether a class of people including this defendant have the requisite mens rea. And I think that's why the text of the rule, opinions about whether the defendant had the mens rea, covers this exact case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So let me say the rule and the reason why I gave you the answer I did. Remember, the rule talks about not just any mental state or not facts that might lead to a mental state, but it talks about the mental state of the crime -- of the element of the crime to convict.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, here, that mental state is knowing, and that's what the expert expressly said.\n\nJudge: Yeah. How about if I say --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- all kinds of those.\n\nJudge: How about if I said something like, in my experience, the organization always informs the courier of the nature of the scheme and doesn't allow the courier to set off until she verbally assents?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. I think, at some point, you get so close that that may well be a statement about mens rea. But what I want to emphasize, Your Honor --\n\nJudge: I guess what I'm suggesting -- and it's really the same point that another judge was making, I think -- is that it just seems at that point a kind of game as to how you frame the testimony so that it falls just over the line, you know, or, instead, you can argue that it's just inside the line, but in the end, the government is going to get this testimony in.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, if you think that's too formalistic, you could, of course, make the rule broader. All I'm saying is that there is a core of Rule 704(b) which is statements about the defendant's mens rea, and that's unquestionably what you have in this case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And how far out that goes and whether it covers your hypothetical would just be a different case on different facts.\n\nJudge: But why is your statement --\n\nJudge: What about --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But it has to mean something.\n\nJudge: What about your own -- oh, sorry.\n\nJudge: Why is it a statement about the defendant's mens rea? That's the part that I'm not understanding.\n\nJudge: So, you know, if the expert in a situation says 80 percent of the time, you know, when these conditions exist, the person knows. Why isn't there still an inference to be drawn as to whether or not the defendant is in the 80 percent or the 20 percent?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because the expert would not -- the expert is just giving a less-than-absolute opinion in that regard.\n\nJudge: No, I understand, but there's --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's still an opinion about whether.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And it's still about people in the defendant's class. Let me put it to you this way, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: No, the question is whether the defendant is in the class. That's what I'm saying. The inference that remains from a testimony that is not a hundred percent.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- is whether or not the defendant is in the class that the expert has identified.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the defendant is certainly in the class, just to use the facts of this case, because the class is people crossing the border with a large quantity of drugs in their car. So the defendant is in that class.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "704", "dialogue": "Judge: I just have one question, and it's about your point about procedural challenges not being the kind of challenges that you could bring. You say that’s part of the explanation for why the government’s parade of horribles on page 39 of its brief is not so horrible. The procedural challenges are out, am I right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s what we think is the best reading of how injury occurs in that context. The Court doesn’t need to reach it in this case because we don’t have procedural challenges.\n\nJudge: So, are arbitrary and capricious challenges procedural or not?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Those are substantive.\n\nJudge: So those would be substantive in your view?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s correct. And you can raise those in as-applied enforcement contexts as well.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: So can I just be clear, injury—you’re saying that injury is an element of an APA claim?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It is.\n\nJudge: Okay. And can I also be clear on the consequences of your decision? Because I worry that if you win, every agency rule in existence today would be subject to some sort of challenge in this way. So I’m trying to understand that argument.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure. First, many of those regulations are already subject to challenge in the as-applied context, as I’ve already said, but we don’t think that there’s going to be any opening of the floodgates because even the government said that parties that can bring this type of claim are relatively uncommon. We think that’s because most parties are harmed the day a regulation is actually issued.\n\nJudge: But why wouldn’t this be extraordinarily destabilizing in the way that was suggested earlier? I mean, we have settled rules that govern all sorts of industries—healthcare, finance—and people have adjusted themselves around them. There are experts who understand how the law works, and companies follow suit. If I understand you correctly, each new company created in an industry can suddenly bring a challenge that might risk invalidation of the entire basis of the industry. Now, whether or not it will succeed, I understand, but aren’t you risking destabilization of the industry in this way?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We don’t think so. We think the experience in the Sixth Circuit is what you’ll see. There was no uptick in challenges to old regulations in the Sixth Circuit, and we would have seen them there in the last—\n\nJudge: Is that possibly because we had other doctrines that prevented it? For example, Chevron existed, and so there were lots of reasons why you might not have seen an uptick. I’m just wondering, in a world in which you could bring these actions, why wouldn’t you have this problem?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think that because most regulations are valid, there’s no argument that they’re unlawful. So you wouldn’t see them. It’s only the ones that have defects that you’re going to see challenges to.\n\nJudge: And going back to an earlier question, we already had a challenge on this very set of regulations, so why is that not enough to satisfy this scenario?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, because our client was first injured by this same rule and has its own challenge to bring under the APA. The American tradition is that everyone gets their day in court, and the APA itself provides for a presumption of judicial review.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Counsel.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. For decades, the courts of appeals have consistently recognized that the six-year statute of limitations on an APA claim accrues at the time of the challenged agency action, not the time when a particular plaintiff comes within the relevant statute’s zone of interests.\n\nIn asking this Court to reject that settled practice, the plaintiff argues that the word “accrues” in Section 2401(a) invariably refers to a time at which a specific plaintiff obtains a complete and present cause of action and that every newly formed entity therefore has six years to challenge any prior agency actions that affect its business or other interests, even if those actions occurred decades ago.\n\nNothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In past cases, this Court explicitly rejected the plaintiff’s one-size-fits-all definition of “accrues,” warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word “accrues,” a court has to consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context.\n\nIn conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congress’s lead.\n\nHere, Congress’s standard practice when it has focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue. It would, therefore, reasonably have expected courts to follow the same approach when applying Section 2401(a)’s catch-all statute of limitations to claims under the APA, and because that’s what the court of appeals did here, the decision below should be affirmed. I welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: So when did the claim accrue for this petitioner?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: This Court has said that a claim can accrue for different purposes or can accrue for purposes of the statute of limitations at a point that’s different from the point at which a plaintiff can bring suit. So the plaintiff could not have sued until some point after it was incorporated, it’s not exactly clear when, but when it had formed an intent to accept debit cards. But for statute of limitations purposes, its claim accrued at the time that regulation was adopted in 2011.\n\nJudge: Is that normal to have two different times?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: In the context of administrative law challenges to agency action, that’s absolutely the standard rule. In other contexts, such as contract or tort law, it’s unusual, but in administrative law, it is typical. It would be strange to apply a different rule here.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I think I must be missing something fundamental. You have an individual or an entity that is harmed by something the government is doing, and you’re saying, well, that’s just too bad, you can’t do anything about it because other people had six years to do something about it. Maybe another person, a business organization or whatever, did do something about it. Your opponent said everybody is entitled to their day in court, and the law doesn’t say “unless somebody else had a day in court” or “unless the government gave other people six years.” What if you weren’t injured in those six years but were injured later? I guess I must be missing something because I don’t understand why this wasn’t settled 60 years ago. It seems pretty fundamental.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I understand that intuition, but the available evidence shows that Congress doesn’t share it. In fact, we’ve identified 29 other limitations periods on challenges that are substantively the same as this one.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But, even in those COVID-19 cases, you know, courts weren't, and we certainly weren't, diving deep into the medical evidence and comparing Europe and America and looking at research.\n\nI mean, this would be, I think, of a different order.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI -- I don't agree, Justice, in the -- in the sense that I do think it is precisely the -- the role of the courts to assess the tailoring and -- and look at the evidence, whether it's presented through expert testimony or not.\n\nIt is not the role of the Court necessarily to say definitively these risks out -- outweigh these benefits or vice versa, but do what the district court did here, which is to look at the assertions of harm, make comparisons to how Tennessee treated all other medical care, and then see whether or not Tennessee had met -- had met its burden under -- under heightened scrutiny.\n\nThat type of tailoring inquiry, I believe, is precisely the -- the role of the -- the Court.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, in the COVID, I have a colleague to my right whom I think very highly of who spoke about the need to -- of the courts to look at that evidence to ensure that there wasn't suppression of religion, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's correct, Justice.\n\nJudge:\nNow, with respect to Justice Barrett's question on COVID, in my mind, it's a little similar -- more similar to the bathroom situation because, there, COVID was a risk not just to the individual and the threat to their own life, but their contact with others could threaten others.\n\nSo it -- the compelling state interest was different than just a pure medical issue, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat -- that's correct. I totally agree, the state interest was different.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nWith respect to treating that issue, you can hear from some of my colleagues that they're worried that -- and there is a plethora of science in this area, both that developed in Europe, and the lower court hasn't really looked at it, no one has -- that courts are ill-suited to that. Why do you think they're not? What -- what about the fundamental role of the Court makes us suited to answer those questions?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I think, first, Justice, the role of the Court is to ensure that when the government draws lines based on suspect classifications, that the -- the states are tested to ensure that they're substantially advancing an important governmental interest.\n\nAnd when it concerns underlying questions of medicine or science, the -- the -- the -- the judges and just -- and just -- judges in the lower courts have every ability to assess the testimony before them, as the district court did here.\n\nThis is not an area where I suggest -- I -- I believe Tennessee is saying that medicine is altogether an area in which suspect classifications have no bearing on the --on the judicial inquiry.\n\nIt is precisely the role of the Court to ensure that the government of Tennessee has -- has substantially advanced an -- an important governmental interest.\n\nJudge:\nI have --\n\nJudge:\nBut -- but --\n\nJudge:\nCounsel --\n\nJudge:\n-- a small question to finish with.\n\nThe regret issue that was raised to the Solicitor General, Respondents cite a figure of 85 percent of children expressing gender dysphoria regret later.\n\nYou use a figure of 1 percent of minors who receive this treatment expressing regret.\n\nCan you tell me where that -- where those figures lie and exactly what the difference is between that 1 percent of children who receive these treatments expressing regret and the 85 percent?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nCertainly, Justice.\n\nAnd so -- so the first point I would say about the 85 percent -- and we addressed this on -- on page 22 of our reply brief -- that's a misleading figure for -- for two reasons.\n\nI think, most critically, it refers to older studies of -- of prepubertal children. And everyone here agrees that the -- the medications that are banned by SB1 are only prescribed to individuals after the onset of puberty.\n\nAnd so, in JA 151 to 153, the evidence shows that once an adolescent reaches the onset of puberty, their likelihood to ultimately desist and identify with their birth sex is very low.\n\nAnd then, as to the question of the 1 percent, the question of regret, which is a different question than what happens with prepubertal children, the record shows there that the rate of regret when people receive this medication after the onset of puberty is as low as 1 percent.\n\nAnd that's in JA 131 to 133. And I think what's important here -- and the Solicitor General mentioned this -- is that is -- that is exponentially lower than the rates of regret of treatments that are expressly permitted by SB1.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nJudge:\nCould we explore what intermediate scrutiny might look like in operation in assessing laws like Tennessee's? So the Solicitor General, on pages -- on page 48 of her brief, lists a lot of things that -- she says: Well, if Tennessee were really concerned about the health and welfare of these minors, it would have taken into account a variety of things.\n\nSo one is waiting periods.\n\nAnother is whether puberty blockers should be exempted. Another concerns things to make sure that the -- the future of these minors is properly respected even though they personally cannot make mature judgments about potentially irreversible procedures.\n\nSo she -- she mentions things like two-parent -- two-parent consent or counseling, readiness criteria, age recommendations, licensing, certification, or reporting requirements for physicians, and other guardrails which are not specified.\n\nSo, if intermediate scrutiny were the regime that would apply, would it not be the case that judges would have to decide which -- whether a particular package containing this much of that and that much of the other thing is sufficient? Wouldn't this be endless litigation based on -- with a decision based on determinations by lay judges regarding complicated medical issues?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo if I could make two points in -- in response, Justice. And -- and the first is going back to the Solicitor General's example of -- of West Virginia, where West Virginia looked at the underlying science and, instead of categorically banning this medical treatment, created pathways with guardrails for individuals to access medical care.\n\nThere has been no litigation over -- over West Virginia's law, and if there were, as if there were in -- in other contexts, the question would remain whether or not the state could make out the showing that this is being treated in such a substantially different way than -- than other forms of medical care.

{"id": "863", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge\nThis Court has said that when -- and this is Thunder Basin footnote 8. Because court of appeals review is available, this case does not implicate the strong presumption that Congress did not mean to prohibit --\n\nJudge\nYeah, but --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\n-- all forms of judicial review.\n\nJudge\nYeah, but if the -- the statute -- what do you say, though -- I mean, it seems to me 1101(a)(47), when it defines final order, really is pegged to the -- the Board's decision one way or the other.\n\nAnd here we have none.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo, Your Honor, I acknowledge that Congress could have spoken more directly to this situation and --\n\nJudge\nWell, it could have spoken to this situation at all, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nWell, I think it could have spoken more directly.\n\nI'll acknowledge that, Your Honor.\n\nBut I think it's clear in light of Section 1228(b), which does speak directly to this situation in two critical places.\n\nSo Section 1228(b)(4)(F) calls an order entered under this -- under that subsection a final order of removal, using exactly the same language that Section 1252 does itself.\n\nAnd that's only confirmed by Section 1228(b)(3), which imposes a stay or a bar on the removal of the alien for 14 days from the date of issuance of that order and ordered that the alien has the opportunity to apply for judicial review, confirming that that order is final when it is issued.\n\nJudge\nIf -- if --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nAnd I think --\n\nJudge\nIf we didn't have Stone, just to shift gears a little bit, would you read 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYour Honor, I acknowledge that the filing deadline likely would not satisfy the clear statement test apart from Stone.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nJust to mention that -- the definition a little bit more, Your Honor, I think the best way to understand this is that it is a statute-wide definition.\n\nIt applies by its terms to the entirety of the INA.\n\nSo it covers Section 1228(b).\n\nAnd I think the best way to read it is to reconcile it with 1228(b), particularly in light of the history of the two provisions.\n\nThe predecessor to Section 1228(b) that originally dispensed with the need for a hearing before an immigration judge was adopted in 1994.\n\nDOJ adopted regulations implementing it in 1995. They did away with the need for any Board review.\n\nSo by the time Congress came to AEDPA in 1996 to add this definition, it already had this part of the statute.\n\nIt already knew this statute called this a final order of deportation, and yet it adopted this definition. I think the best way to read it together with that is to reconcile it, to say that Board -- the period for Board review expires immediately when no Board review is allowed.\n\nBut if you disagree with me on that, I think Section 1228(b) itself answers this question, and it's strongly supported by Section 1231 and what this Court said about administrative finality in Guzman Chavez.\n\nAs the government acknowledges in its reply --\n\nJudge\nWhat do you say about the possibility that some courts of appeals won't allow these protective appeals to sit on their books for years on end?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYour Honor, I think this Court could provide guidance about the situations in which those motions for abeyance should be granted.\n\nThe Court has done something similar in the habeas context in Rhines v. Weber, where it authorized a stay-in-abeyance procedure for district courts so that habeas petitioners could go into district courts and exhaust their -- go into state court to exhaust their claims before coming back.\n\nThis Court could authorize something like that.\n\nI don't think that's necessary here, Your Honor, because I think the meaning of the filing deadline is plain.\n\nBut the Court could provide guidance in that way.\n\nJudge\nCounsel, you say that Stone's rejection of tolling indicates that it's a true jurisdictional holding.\n\nBut tolling can be unavailable in equitable proceedings as well, can't it, when the deadlines are -- are equitable?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nIt is true that some claim processing rules also foreclose tolling, but they don't do it in the way that Stone did.\n\nSo this Court in Irwin held that non-jurisdictional statutory deadlines are presumptively amenable to equitable tolling.\n\nWe see nothing like a rebuttal in Stone of that presumption of equitable tolling.\n\nInstead, we see the automatic and reflexive connection of the Court's holding that the deadline is jurisdictional to the consequence that it doesn't allow for equitable tolling.\n\nThat's the exact opposite of what happened in Beggerly, the case that this Court analyzed in Wilkins and said didn't count as a definitive jurisdictional precedent.\n\nIt had an extensive analysis of equitable tolling.\n\nAnd the Court said if it was a true jurisdictional deadline, it wouldn't have needed that extensive analysis.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we have in Stone; a direct and immediate connection between the conclusion that the deadline is jurisdictional and the consequence that it doesn't allow for equitable tolling.\n\nJudge\nWell, you also argue that the citation of the cert deadline and the appeal deadline is very, very significant here, but those seem to be quite different in the sense that you're dealing with the vertical deadlines of quite some significance.\n\nAnd I wonder whether that is a particularly compelling analogy.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYour Honor, I think it was the analogy that the Court found compelling in Stone.\n\nIt was the analogy that supported the Court's ultimate conclusion that the deadline was jurisdictional and engaged in this extensive analysis, comparing the deadline to file a notice of appeal from a final order of deportation to the time to notice an appeal from a district court judgment, which, as you point out, this Court has recognized as jurisdictional, both before and after Arbaugh.\n\nThe Court also compared the effect of the motion for reconsideration to the effect of a Rule 60(b) motion, which doesn't strip the court of appeals of jurisdiction.\n\nAnd I think that -- the force of that analogy is that it shows the Court understood the filing deadline as a window of time at which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, regardless of any motion for reconsideration, and after which it could not assert jurisdiction, just like in the notice of appeal context.\n\nI think all of that analysis supported what happens on pages 405 of Stone and shows that the Court truly meant what it said when it said that the deadline was jurisdictional.\n\nJudge\nBut just to underscore Justice Gorsuch's point, under our modern jurisprudence, you would agree that it's not jurisdictional, that you're relying on the Stone precedent as the reason why we should hold that it's jurisdictional here?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Instead, their theory is that by simply knowing that some percentage of retailers may be doing something illegal, that somehow puts us on the hook for everything that the retailers are doing.\n\nThis is kind of a common law area. You'd think that they could cite one case that comes anywhere close to that.\n\nJudge\nSo --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nBut they don't cite a single case.\n\nJudge\n-- Mr. Francisco, I -- that's sort of what I'm a little confused about and I wanted to focus on, which is it seems to me that the core of your argument both here and in your brief has been that there's an implausible theory of aiding-and-abetting liability based on what they've alleged and no case in American history supports this theory of liability, as if the question before us is evaluating the viability of Mexico's theory.\n\nAnd what I'm looking at is a statute that I think really makes this case about the scope of the predicate exception, that it's not really, you know, an invitation to assess as a common law matter whether or not we think these facts allege aiding-and-abetting liability. Would you agree with me that the PLCAA statute takes off the table theories of tort with respect to these kinds of manufacturers and, really, the only question is whether the statutory exception applies in this situation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nWell, I --yeah, I think I would agree that we're dis -- we're -- we're arguing about what the meaning of the statute is.\n\nBut the statute can only be triggered if they find a violation that's the proximate cause.\n\nHere, the violation that they've identified --\n\nJudge\nNo, I understand.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\n-- is aiding and abetting.\n\nJudge\nBut that proximate cause analysis is coming up in the context of an exception to the immunity that Congress has set forth, is that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nSure.\n\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nAnd I think that's important because the scope of that exception may not be coterminous with our understanding of aiding-and-abetting liability as a common law principle.\n\nIn other words, you look at Twitter, for example, and you say: Okay, is this -- are what --is what is being alleged here the same as aiding-and-abetting liability as it was set forth in that statute? That was a totally different statutory scheme.\n\nThat statute, JASTA in the Twitter case, was about allowing for these kinds of claims.\n\nAnd so what counts for aiding-and-abetting liability in Twitter may not be what Congress intended for this exception.\n\nI feel like we have to focus on where we actually are in this context in making this determination.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nWell, Your Honor, I think that's where I might very much disagree with the theory that you're articulating.\n\nI think that they do have to show a violation. They've alleged it's aiding and abetting. There's no aiding and abetting in the air.\n\nWhat Twitter purported to do was look at traditional aiding-and-abetting principles --\n\nJudge\nNo, I understand, but Twitter --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\n-- and apply them.\n\nJudge\n-- was a different kind of statute.\n\nWe have said that, you know, when we're doing statutory interpretation, when we're thinking about aiding-and-abetting liability, it may not be the same in every statutory scheme.\n\nAnd I guess what I'm just trying to -- I mean, this is not supposed to be like a -- a --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nSure.\n\nYeah.\n\nJudge\n-- a statement that is necessarily against your position.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the framing of this.\n\nIt seems to me this is a statutory interpretation question about the meaning of what the predicate exception says, knowingly violated a state or federal statute.\n\nAiding and abetting is in the examples.\n\nIt's not even in the actual core statutory statement of what would qualify.\n\nSo shouldn't we be focused more on trying to understand what Congress meant when it was excepting -- you say narrowly --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\n-- a certain kind of claim?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nWell, Your Honor, to the extent I understand what you're getting at, first, I do think that you really do have to grapple with the aiding-and-abetting liability issue and Twitter sets out the framework.\n\nBut, even if you want to take a step back and look at what Congress was getting at more broadly, Congress's entire purpose was to prohibit lawsuits just like this one.\n\nIt was trying to prohibit lawsuits that had been brought by the City of Chicago, the City of Cincinnati, the City of Boston, on theories and seeking relief exactly like this one.\n\nSo, if you adopt my friend's position on the other side, you have essentially gutted PLCAA.\n\nAnd remember what the larger purpose of PLCAA was.\n\nIt was actually to ultimately protect Second Amendment rights by preventing plaintiffs from bankrupting the industry through frivolous lawsuits.\n\nAfter all, the Second Amendment doesn't really mean anything if there's no -- nobody from whom you can buy a firearm.\n\nJudge\nSo -- so, Mr. Francisco --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nSo I'm willing to take --\n\nJudge\n-- just to follow up on this, PLCAA, as you call it, says that -- that you've got to show a violation of a state or federal statute.\n\nAnd we -- Justice Thomas asked you, and I -- I still am not sure we completely identified what that statute is.\n\nI think it's 18 U.S.C. 922, maybe 923.\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nYour Honor, I --\n\nJudge\nWe don't know?

{"id": "420", "dialogue": "Plaintiff Lawyer: -- try --try to take a crack at the --at the question itself because, you know, it may come up in other cases.\n\nAnd -- and I think what the statute says is that the -- the unlawful practice occurs at three points: the adoption, when the person is subject to the policy, and then where the effects are felt.\n\nAnd Congress was specifically focused on claims with respect to compensation and amended the ADA to make clear that -- that this applied to the ADA.\n\nAnd so I think that is Congress telling us that at this very kind of situation where somebody is subject to the policy, that the -- the unlawful practice occurs there.\n\nJudge: Counsel, you say in your brief as part of your argument that if the retirees are not unable to perform, they are able to perform?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: You smile.\n\nI don't think that follows at all.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's not the most intuitive thing, and, you know, I'll admit that when I first read the statute, that wasn't the first thing that jumped out.\n\nBut I do think --and we have lots of other ways to approach the problem, from common usage and grammar and examples that we've given. But I do think, if you're just thinking about it in terms of formal logic, you know, those are opposites.\n\nAnd -- and so the idea is, if you take a sentence and you negate the sentence --\n\nJudge: Well, no, I understand the -- the plain language.\n\nI just --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: -- don't think it makes any sense in a situation where, most likely, because you're in a different factual context, you don't know whether they're able or unable.\n\nSo you wouldn't choose one or the other.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Right.\n\nI mean, another way to take a crack at this is just to say that it's a question that's sort of a non sequitur because what you have here is a sentence that has an embedded premise, right? The -- whoever drafted this sentence was not -- was not very precisely speaking to the question of: Do you have to have this position at the time or not? They were sort of assuming that.\n\nAnd it says, you know, \"can perform the essential functions of the person that such individual holds or desires.\" And then the question is: Do you have to hold or desire the position? And I think the best way grammatically to understand that is that there are present-tense verbs.\n\nYou have to be able to perform the function.\n\nBut then the rest of the -- the part of the sentence after -- with the word \"that\" and after \"that,\" is a restrictive clause, modifying the position.\n\nAnd so the thing you have to be able to perform is the essential functions of the job that you hold or desire to the extent that you hold or desire a job.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Now I don't think you need to reach --\n\nJudge: Counsel, it's a bit -- lacks intuity to think that every retired person who's not seeking a job or holding it is entitled to sue for disability, particularly -- for example, let's give you that while they were employed, they weren't entitled to disability benefits.\n\nAfter they retired, the company started giving it to retirees, to employees and retirees, and then took it away.\n\nYour reading would permit them to sue still, correct?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Well, I think they would -- that suit would fail. I -- I understand the intuition of the question, which is: Have we opened some, you know, big trap door that expands the reach of the statute in -- in --in a way that we should be worried about?\n\nJudge: That's exactly my question.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And -- and, you know, I will note that the -- the other side hasn't identified that category, nor did the amici, but I can -- I can see where that concern comes from.\n\nAnd I think one way to answer the question is to look at the discrimination rule and notice that it still requires that any claim be in regard to employee compensation or the terms, privileges, or conditions of employment.\n\nAnd that -- that's the same language in Title VII.\n\nSo Title VII makes unlawful a -- an act of discrimination with respect to those same nouns.\n\nAnd we're not concerned in the Title VII context that there's some, you know, trap door that opens up a large category of claims. And the reason why is you don't have a claim of that kind unless there is either a prospective employment relationship or some employment relationship that is the locus of that discrimination.\n\nThe same thing is true with respect to the ADA.\n\nSo I don't think our argument opens up some broad category of claims.\n\nYou still have to have that --the discrimination has to concern the terms and conditions or compensation of employment.\n\nJudge: I have one other question.\n\nThe SG, I believe, takes the position that an employer discriminates against a retiree as to employment benefits that she earned while she was a qualified individual.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Why don't you -- why haven't you adopted that?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Well, we do endorse the -- the SG's theory.\n\nThat's what we meant to do in our reply.\n\nAnd -- and, if that wasn't clear, I -- I, you know, endorse the -- the SG's theory, and I think it is an alternative textual pathway that gets you to basically the same result.\n\nAnd you can get there --\n\nJudge: Does that then take us to Justice Alito's question of if the discriminatory effect is felt after retirement? If someone didn't have Parkinson's or a condition before retirement, while they were still performing, would that then lead us to Justice Alito's question?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It -- it could.\n\nNot in this case for the reasons I was discussing with Justice Alito, but, in other cases, yes.\n\nAnd I think there are a number of -- if I may complete?\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nYeah. Please do.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: There are a number of hypothetical scenarios that I think the Court should be concerned about, for example, somebody who runs into a burning building and is instantly rendered unqualified or somebody who develops a disability later.\n\nAnd those -- those cases would be captured by the Solicitor General's alternative theory and also by our part two arguments but not by the narrow theory.\n\nJudge: Thank you.

{"id": "101", "dialogue": "Judge: When a party invokes a delegation clause, this Court unanimously in the Henry Schein decision from a few terms ago made clear that courts have no power and no business answering the arbitrability question for themselves, even in a case where they think the invocation of the delegation clause was wholly groundless. We are a far cry from that scenario here.\n\nI think your hypothetical where there are two contracts that really address totally disconnected scenarios might be closer to Henry Schein, but Henry Schein then, I think, provides the appropriate avenue. And as the Court said in that case, if someone really is frivolously or improperly invoking a delegation clause, arbitrators have ways to quickly move the matter back to court. There may be sanctions available.\n\nThere are other tools—\n\nJudge: Yeah, but at some point, you get into the fundamental principle of arbitration that the parties must have agreed to turn something over to the arbitrator.\n\nAnd it seems to me that if you get a contract that is way out of the—however you want to describe it—the scope, that saying it's up for the arbitrator kind of skips over that pretty important part.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: In this case, there is undisputedly a clear and unmistakable delegation clause of all disputes about Coinbase services.\n\nThese claims are about Coinbase services.\n\nThe respondents say that they used Coinbase services to enter into a sweepstakes when they wished they had mailed in a postcard instead. That is absolutely a dispute about Coinbase services.\n\nIt is covered by the arbitration agreement as written.

But there's not a carveout from delegation.\n\nAnd that makes sense because the purpose of delegation is to set up a streamlined, efficient process for resolving these arbitrability disputes.

{"id": "763", "dialogue": "Judge: The purpose of a post-seizure hearing is to determine who keeps custody of the car, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the focus is, therefore, different? The focus in the hearing would be that there might be a disputed issue of fact with respect to ownership. The government might claim it needs discovery. The government might claim it has some facts that would lead to a judgment that it needs to explore. But the court would then weigh whether or not that is sufficient not to give custody to the car owner pending the hearing, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Judge.\n\nJudge: So summary judgment doesn't answer this question or the isolated question of who keeps custody of the car pending the ultimate judgment, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right.\n\nJudge: Now, whether or not summary judgment is adequate given that difference in the focus of the hearings, I'm presuming that's why you're saying that's not the issue before us. The issue before us is, which of the two tests do we apply to determine whether that's enough or not?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right, Judge.\n\nJudge: I mean, if I could ask about that same kind of thing, what the difference is between the retention hearing and the final forfeiture determination—take a case like this, where your client is raising an innocent owner defense, and I would think that the questions about whether she was an innocent owner are pretty much the same in the retention hearing and in the final forfeiture determination, isn't that correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the substantive question is the same, yes.\n\nJudge: Now, there is a different burden, but if she can prove at the retention hearing under a probable cause standard that she is entitled to the car back, I mean, there's no way the government is going to lose on the final determination, right? I mean, she's proved that she's entitled to the car?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's most likely correct. In theory, by the time of the final determination, there could be some additional discovery or investigation that happens that would change the calculus.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I suppose in an individual case, but most likely—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Most likely.\n\nJudge: The government probably would just give up at that point, right? Under this very generous standard to the government, they've lost, they're not going to keep on pursuing the thing, so she's gotten her car back and the case is over.\nAnd I guess what this suggests is that in both cases, you're really adjudicating the same thing, which is: Am I entitled to my car back right now? So how is it really different? I understand saying this is interim, this is final, but in the end, it's just: Am I entitled to my car back now?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Judge, I think that the substantive question is the same, but there are a few key differences between the retention hearing and the later merits determination.\nFor one thing, I don't know that the premise is correct that the government would just give up if it loses at the retention hearing. Again, there's a different procedural standard later. The government has the opportunity to conduct more discovery. The government also has, in Alabama, as well as 25 other states, a financial incentive to keep pursuing the forfeiture proceedings because they get to keep the proceeds.\nAnd so I don't know that it's empirically correct that the government would simply give up if it loses at the retention hearing.\n\nJudge: I guess what I'm asking is, if we had a case that says, you know, the constitutional rule about forcing a determination about who is entitled to the car is the Barker rule, why is it that we can say: Well, we have that rule, but, in fact, there's another constitutional rule which is much more beneficial to the claimant that's meant to address exactly the same question that we held in $8,850 was addressed by Barker?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think they're different—for one thing, I think they are different questions, as the Second and the Sixth Circuit have explained.\nIn Barker, the only question—it was essentially a case where the claimant was trying to argue a gotcha. There was no argument in Barker—or in $8,850 or Von Neumann—that the government was not ultimately entitled to forfeit the property. There was no innocent owner defense.\nThe claimant's argument there was: Well, but you waited too long in order to actually complete the proceedings and, therefore, I get my car back. And in that situation, this Court said the Barker test applies.\nThere's a different argument where you have an innocent owner defense, where you have somebody coming forward and saying: I should be entitled, as a matter of Alabama state law, to the rights that Alabama state law gives me. I should be entitled to keep my car. And the state can't effect a de facto forfeiture of that car for months or years during the pendency of proceedings.\n\nJudge: But, in both cases, the claimant wants the property back in the interim. And the court, I mean, couldn't have been much clearer in its language:\n\"The forfeiture proceeding without more provides the hearing required by due process to protect Von Neumann's property interest in the car,\" and then repeated it two pages later, \"the right to a forfeiture proceeding meeting the Barker test satisfies any due process right with respect to the car and the money.\"\nAnd those, to me, didn't seem to be accidental comments. I went back to the oral argument transcript where exactly this question was posed about whether that is all the process that’s due, and the court was very definitive.\nSo you've referred a few times to a methodological question. Methodologically, how can we get around, from your perspective, that seemingly clear statement? I know you have factual distinctions, but those are broad, clear statements that have guided courts since.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Judge, I think those statements have broad language that has to be understood in context.\nWith respect to the first sentence that you quoted—\"the forfeiture proceeding without more provides the post-seizure hearing that due process requires\"—that was in part 2 of Von Neumann.\nPart 2 of Von Neumann was the section of that opinion holding that the claimant had no due process interest in the first place. That sentence can't reasonably be understood to say anything about due process where, as here, the substantive Alabama law confers an additional interest that then gives rise to new due process requirements.\n\nWith respect to the second sentence that you quoted, first of all, that was just referring back to the first sentence from part 2, which, again, doesn't apply here. In the third part of the Von Neumann opinion where that sentence comes from, the court assumed that a protected due process interest existed.\nThat assumption doesn't really make a lot of sense doctrinally. You can't have a due process interest in a remission proceeding, which is essentially like a discretionary pardon.\n\nJudge: That was the argument, though, wasn't it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm sorry?\n\nJudge: That was the argument, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The court assumed there that there was a due process interest. But I'm saying the assumption doesn't even really hold because you can't have a due process interest in that kind of a discretionary proceeding.\nAnd beyond that, again, the argument that the Court actually addressed in the Von Neumann opinion was about a final determination. It was about the speed to final determination in a context where there was no substantive right to avoid the forfeiture.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Land sales, land leases, things like that. I don't know exactly how their rule would apply in those circumstances, but I think it's at least plausible to think that it would apply to all of those. I don't know why it wouldn't on its logic. Again, I think that would be destabilizing.\n\nJudge: And, number two, opposing counsel, in answering a previous question, said that procedural challenges would not happen. But in your brief, you suggested they would. Could you tell me why their concession is not convincing to you?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I mean, we said it in our brief before they had made that concession. They hadn't said that until the reply brief. And their complaint includes procedural challenges. If you look at paragraphs 93 and 95 of their complaint, they include arguments that the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation of Regulation II and that the record before the agency wasn't sufficient to support it. So I’m glad that they're willing to give up procedural challenges, but we hadn't anticipated that before.\n\nJudge: Mr. Snyder, I want to emphasize that I'm asking you a hypothetical question. It's an \"if\" question. There is obviously another big challenge to the way courts review agency action before this Court. Has the Justice Department and the agencies considered whether there is any interaction between these two challenges? And, again, you know, if Chevron were reinforced, were affirmed—if Chevron were reversed, how does that affect what you're talking about here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I want to be careful here. I mean, we of course have thought about it. I think what I'd say is that a decision for the plaintiff here would magnify the effect of any other decisions changing the way that this Court or other courts have approached administrative law questions, because it would potentially mean that those changes would then be applied retroactively to every regulation that an agency has adopted in the last, I don’t know, 75 years or something.\n\nJudge: One follow-up question on something you said earlier. This is also about future effects on standing. They asked in this suit to set aside the rule. Your position, the Solicitor General's position, is that that can't be done under the APA. If you can't set aside the rule and you're not a regulated party, how is their injury redressable in this suit and why do they have standing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think our position has been that courts are only able to provide relief to the party before them and that ordinarily—\n\nJudge: How would that be done in a circumstance like this?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think—and I’m a little hesitant to say this—but I think that in this circumstance, it’s possible that the only way to provide this party relief would be vacatur. I’m not certain that that’s right, but I think that’s possible.\n\nJudge: I think that’s probably right, which is why I was surprised when you said what you said, that if you don’t have the set-aside remedy, they probably don’t have standing here.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the reason is that the power that the court has under the APA is to provide relief to the party before it, not more broadly. And it’s possible that in circumstances where the only way to give the party before the court relief is vacatur, that that would be consistent with traditional equitable considerations in a way that providing vacatur in other cases is not.\n\nJudge: Well, that’s a new twist.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don’t intend that to be a new twist.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So to the extent that is—\n\nJudge: Okay.

And that is a -- just a case I've never heard of that says that --\n\nJudge: Well, I mean, states could do it in the future too.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nIt's like a statute with a contingent remainder.\n\nI just don't know of many statutes that are like here's a waiver and we hope that everyone else will -- will -- will get on, you know -- just there's no statute like that that's contingent.\n\nIt's bad enough to try to get a waiver when you have a clear and ambiguous waiver and Congress acted to say, notwithstanding, it's abrogated, and then they list all 59 case -- 59 sections and the government says, yeah, but you need a second waiver if you ever have to rely on state law.\n\nAnd I do think it's significant that no case of a century is talking about a federal defense.\n\nAnd I think their preemption argument kind of shows how strange it is because they're saying Congress wanted the trustee to rely on state law, but we incorporate a federal law defense when, normally, the government -- your cases would just say you look at that as implied repeal.\n\nYou're in a -- you're interpreting a federal cause of action and everyone concedes all elements of state law are met, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nThe only defense that's lacking is the one defense that was waived in the statute, sovereign immunity.\n\nJudge: I guess I'm not sure about the nature of the argument, if -- if you're conceding that there were these four states and that there could have been more in the future and Congress wants zero states, why Congress wouldn't have done exactly this.\n\nLike, well, four states is four states too many.\n\nIt's not 50 states, but it's more than zero states. And who knows, the four might go up to 10.\n\nAnd we're -- you know, so we're concerned about this.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I mean, I just -- I feel bad for Congress that they tried to do the best they could and you're going to say it's not good enough when they said \"with respect to\" in the broadest -- the government doesn't even have an argument that the immunity, the waiver, is not with respect to the state law elements. They don't even have an argument.\n\nThey just say, well, sovereign immunity would block the claim even though sovereign immunity is waived with respect to the claim.\n\nIt -- literally, the statute says sovereign immunity is waived with respect to 544(b).\n\nIt has a claim.\n\nIt has elements.\n\nJudge: But this waiver of sovereign immunity is not supposed to affect the substance.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: It's not supposed to affect the substance unless the claim otherwise exists.\n\nAnd, again, the only thing lacking here is sovereign immunity.\n\nThey're not -- we're not talking about a defect under state law.\n\nJudge: But -- but, Ms. -- Ms. --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We have a fraudulent transfer.\n\nJudge: -- Ms. Blatt, I guess just conceptually, here -- here's what I'm struggling with, and maybe you can help.\n\nIt seems to me that the result of your view is that the trustee can recover money from the estate under this particular circumstance in a way that no actual creditor could because you concede that all actual creditors bringing a lawsuit against the United States for recovery for these fraud -- this fraudulent transfer would be barred by -- by sovereign immunity.\n\nSo --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nIf --\n\nJudge: No?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nJust if you -- if you're just putting aside -- remember, we have that alternative argument that you never had to sue the United States.\n\nYou could --\n\nJudge: No, I understand.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: But putting aside that --\n\nJudge: Putting aside the alternative argument --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- you would -- we -- of course, we agree that sovereign immunity applies outside of bankruptcy, which is why it makes it so strange for you to hold that --\n\nJudge: No, but let me tell you what I think is strange, and then you can respond.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay. (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nSo -- so we have a situation in which the trustee is recovering this money, putting it in under circumstances in which no actual creditor could. Ms. Dubin says: But think about the work of 544.\n\nWhat 544 was really about, she says, is making sure that an actual creditor who would otherwise be able to get this money for himself is actually essentially barred from doing so and the money goes into the estate and split -- is split up among creditors, that the work of 544 is to give the trustee the ability to execute the claim that the actual creditor would otherwise have been able to in a way that undermines bankruptcy principles.\n\nSo why isn't she right about that? If we think about what 544 is really about, then it seems to me to undermine your view that we should be reading 106 to allow for the trustee to recover money that an actual creditor would not have been able to recover.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think you're just saying Congress didn't pass 106.\n\nThere's a waiver of sovereign immunity --\n\nJudge: No, no, no.\n\nI'm talking about the principles behind --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay, but 5 -- 544 has -- has a waiver of sovereign immunity that the government concedes six ways to Sunday is written into 544(b).\n\nJudge: And what Ms. Dubin says --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If I could just finish my answer.\n\nI know what Ms. Dubin said.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If I can just finish my answer.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "785", "dialogue": "Judge: There has been some discussion in the briefs about the exact scope of the Almendarez-Torres exception. Are these questions litigated, or are they merely academic? Does the exact scope matter for this case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It does not matter for this case because the Court only needs to apply the rule from Descamps and Mathis, which states that any offense-related conduct beyond the elements falls under Apprendi, not Almendarez-Torres. That is enough to resolve this case.\n\nThere are a few additional facts, but candidly, there are not many cases addressing them because few recidivist statutes deal with aspects like the date of the offense. There is little case law on these matters because, in most situations, the defendant may not have a legitimate argument regarding such facts.\n\nJudge: I would like to explore what happens on remand—not that we need to decide it now, but just to understand it better.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: The distinction between what qualifies for harmless error review and what is considered structural error is sometimes unclear. For example, it is structural error if a defendant does not receive a reasonable doubt instruction or is denied their choice of counsel. However, it is subject to harmless error review if a jury is not instructed on an element of the crime or if there is a variance.\n\nHere, we are dealing with a plea bargaining situation, meaning there is no trial record to analyze for harmless error review. That raises a concern—how can harmless error review be conducted when there is no trial record? Wouldn’t the review process involve examining the very records the defendant wants to challenge before a jury?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: How does that work? How does harmless error review proceed when there is no trial record? Also, in this case, the defendant pleaded guilty to an information that listed different crimes as ACCA predicate offenses. He did not receive notice that the government would use crimes from when he was 18 to enhance his sentence by 15 years. Now, in his mid-40s, he will remain in prison until his 60s. How can we analyze this situation and conclude that it was harmless that he did not even know what he was pleading guilty to?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There are challenges even in conducting a Neder-type harmless error analysis after a jury verdict. Justice Scalia pointed this out in dissent in that case, arguing that it becomes a highly speculative exercise.\n\nOf course, the majority of the Court disagreed. The Court has also disagreed in cases related to indictments. I do not want to argue too strongly against precedent, but your point is valid—when dealing with plea bargains, determining what a jury might have found is difficult. It requires an unusually strong showing from the government that the outcome would have been the same based on the kind of documents permitted under the Almendarez-Torres exception.\n\nThere will be cases where factors like widely spaced conviction dates make the harmless error argument stronger. However, in this case, the concerns raised reinforce the argument that we have a serious basis for a non-harmless error claim on remand.\n\nJudge: Courts have nearly always treated offenses as occurring on separate occasions when they happened a day or more apart or at a significant distance. That is still good law, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Of course.\n\nJudge: The phrase used was \"nearly always.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that is correct.\n\nJudge: A ruling here could require states to change their recidivism practices. That is something we did not contemplate in Descamps and Mathis. You argue that those cases were based on constitutional concerns, but they did not explicitly address the constitutional question, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I believe they did address the constitutional question, although they also included statutory analysis.\n\nRegarding the effect on states, only a small number of states have a requirement similar to the \"different occasions\" finding. Overruling Almendarez-Torres would have a much greater impact. But in this case, the number of affected states is minimal.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that there is no amicus brief from any state suggests that this would not be a significant burden. States could easily adjust their existing procedures to include a jury determination.\n\nJudge: One concern raised by amici is that because plea bargaining is so prevalent, making this an element of the offense could actually be harmful to criminal defendants. How do you respond to that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The brief from NAFD addresses this concern. The change would actually improve plea bargaining dynamics.\n\nIn felon-in-possession cases where ACCA enhancements apply, defendants previously had no opportunity to negotiate because probation officers could simply inform the judge that the sentence had to be increased. Defendants had no fair notice and no leverage in negotiations.\n\nStatistics show that 14 percent of felon-in-possession cases go to trial, which is a high number for the federal system. If the different occasions clause were treated as an element of the offense, prosecutorial discretion would come into play. Defendants could then negotiate in exchange for removing the ACCA enhancement.\n\nAdditionally, when this case was litigated, the maximum sentence for a 922(g) conviction was 10 years, but now it is 15 years. That change in law strengthens the argument that this shift would actually improve the plea bargaining process.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "66", "dialogue": "Judge: All right. So I understand here that what we're really talking about is the extent to which the government can rely on voluntary cessation to claim that he no longer has a claim.\n\nJudge: And I think that's slightly different than an analysis of whether or not he would have had standing to bring this in, you know, under these circumstances if -- if for no other reason than the standing sort of analysis is on him, right? I mean, it's his burden to show that he was injured, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nJudge: Here, he's brought a claim. The government, I -- I didn't take you to be saying that there's something wrong with his claim in its inception, but the government is now arguing that the claim is no longer live because of mootness because they have removed him from the list.\n\nJudge: And our standard for that is the Laidlaw, you know, standard that we're talking about.\n\nJudge: And so I guess I'm, keeping all of that framework in mind, wanting to understand why the government's argument about, well, this is on the totality of the circumstances and he could possibly be put back on the list, why haven't you just talked yourself out of the standard?\n\nJudge: I mean, you -- you -- you just in response to my colleagues suggested that he could be put back on the list if he started giving money to this organization again.\n\nJudge: So that sounds like you lose under the Laidlaw standard, doesn't it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, it -- it does not because the -- the standard is reasonable expectation of recurrence.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's got to be reasonable. And -- and I take the point that we have the absolutely clear, the reasonable.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But, I mean, if I told you you have a hundred percent chance of having a 50 percent shot at victory, that's still 50 percent.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nJudge: But what makes this --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: -- what makes this different from -- from Lyons is the reasonableness of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, right?\n\nJudge: The conduct at issue here is not the reasonableness that he will commit another crime or the, you know, reasonableness that the police will react in a certain way.\n\nJudge: The conduct at issue here, I think, is the reasonableness that he will support a mosque again in -- am I wrong about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would push back on that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The -- the reasonableness is that he poses a threat of engaging in one of four enumerated acts of terrorism.\n\nJudge: But you previously assessed in her hypothetical that he did that when he gave money to a mosque or raised -- had a fundraiser to a mosque, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And that's why I pushed back on the premise when she asked me that question, because it's never about doing any one thing.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's always a totality of circumstances, not even necessarily things that the individual him- or herself says or does.\n\nJudge: Well, I don't think that that helps you very much.\n\nJudge: Let's say it's a totality of the circumstances.\n\nJudge: There are five circumstances.\n\nJudge: Then he stopped doing one of them, and you thought now there are only four circumstances, and it was the fifth one that pushed us over the edge, so we're going to take him off the list.\n\nJudge: And now he starts doing the fifth again.\n\nJudge: So now we say, well, the totality of the circumstances, he's back on the list.\n\nJudge: I don't think it really helps in the end that it's a multi-factor inquiry.\n\nJudge: At some point, you're making a judgment about conduct that puts you on the list.\n\nJudge: And the problem here is that you're -- you basically just admitted, conceded, that the same conduct, if he participated in it again, could put him back on the list.\n\nJudge: So, once that's true, I don't really see where the mootness argument is.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And I think that if you take -- if you accept that argument, I think you would essentially conclude that no No Fly List claim ever could be moot, and the voluntary cessation exception, the judge-made exception, to Article III would swallow the mootness rule.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don't --\n\nJudge: I think that might be right, I mean -- I mean, just based on the theory of the other side, though, because you're not going to have the information to know whether the person might engage in the -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the fifth --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: -- the fifth piece of it again.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: It would be silly for the government to say, oh, this person is never going to be on the list again.\n\nJudge: That would be --\n\nJudge: -- that would be totally irresponsible, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, I mean, I think, again, it's -- he says -- his argument is that he doesn't know what put him on the list.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But, if that's -- if that's the claim, then I -- I think, you know, you -- you would -- I think the voluntary cessation exception really would swallow the rule.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, to get back to something I mentioned to you earlier, what if, for example, a court were to see this information and determine, oh, it's very unlikely for it to recur, I think, on Respondent's argument, the case still wouldn't be moot because he wouldn't know.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And so it would always have to get to the merits.\n\nJudge: No, I think it's -- yeah, if the court knew.\n\nJudge: The problem is, for us, to try to assess --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- the standard that you and Justice Alito were discussing is very challenging --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It is, but --\n\nJudge: -- when we are in the dark about what's going on.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I take the point, but -- but -- but imagine this.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I mean, like, imagine if a court actually were to review it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Remember these are all very rare circumstances to begin with, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's a U.S. person posing a threat of engaging in terrorism.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's very rare that it happened.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: These are very rare circumstances that would lead to it. I'm not sure, even if a court were --\n\nJudge: But he's on the list before. Oh, keep going.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, that's true.\n\nJudge: I -- yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: He was on the list before. But, if a court were to review it and say, okay, I see why he was on the list before, okay, I now see why he was taken off, I'm not sure the -- a court really has the intelligence assessment and institutional competence to determine whether these extremely rare events and rare combinations of circumstances are likely to recur in the future.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I would guess at that point --\n\nJudge: So which way do we go then?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think you would go with, well, presumption of regularity.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The government doesn't put people on the list unless they satisfy the threshold, just like we don't assume people will engage in illegal --\n\nJudge: That's not really the standard.\n\nJudge: The standard is whether it's reasonably likely to recur.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And --\n\nJudge: And that depends on your assessment of the person's activity, and that's a complete wild card.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "780", "dialogue": "Judge\n-- but I just want to understand what's before us.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nWould it be feasible in any timeframe? I -- I take the government doesn't dispute that it's infeasible in the 270 days provided by law.\n\nBut would it be feasible at all?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYour --Your Honor, I think, at least as we understand how they've interpreted the qualified divestiture provision, it would be exceedingly difficult under any timeframe for two principal reasons.\n\nThe first is that there's a global team of engineers that are some in China, some in Europe, some in the United States, that maintain and update the original source code. And, as we understand their interpretation, a qualified divestiture would prohibit any kind of coordination with that global team of engineers.\n\nThe other reason is because, as we understand how they're interpreting it, a qualified divestiture would divorce the U.S. platform from the global content.\n\nSo, for example, there are videos created in the United States.\n\nThere are videos created in Ireland.\n\nIn order to get global content, we need access to the Irish videos.\n\nThey need access to the U.S. videos.\n\nJudge\nI got that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWe understand that couldn't happen.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nSo you think it's probably not feasible in any timeline?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, Your Honor, I think it would be extraordinarily difficult.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nLast -- last fact question.\n\nThen I'll yield the floor here.\n\nThe government admits that it has no evidence that TikTok has engaged in covert content manipulation in this country but says that ByteDance has responded to PRC demands to censor content outside of China in other countries.\n\nAgain, you deny that in your reply brief.\n\nSomebody has to be right about that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell -- well, Your Honor, the problem there is everything that follows what you just read is redacted, and so I don't know what it says.\n\nWhat the record shows is two things. The record shows first what you just said: They haven't done anything here in the United States with respect to TikTok, Incorporated.\n\nAnd, second, the record also shows through our transparency reports that we haven't removed or restricted content on the TikTok platform in other parts of the world.\n\nAnd TikTok doesn't operate in China.\n\nIt operates in other parts of the world.\n\nWe haven't removed or restricted content at the request of China.\n\nThat's what we put out in our regular transparency reports.\n\nJudge\nRemoved or restricted, though, doesn't necessarily cover covert content manipulation, though, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, Your Honor, I'm limiting my response to what's in the record.\n\nJudge\nTo what's in the record? Okay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nIt's very difficult for me to respond to things that I -- where I don't know what the accusation is.\n\nJudge\nI have other questions about the secret evidence in this case, but we'll get to that later.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nMr. Francisco, can I ask you a question about the relevant speech here? So it strikes me that this is a little different than your Bezos example because, there, it's clearly content discrimination because we're talking about the ability to post particular articles versus other articles.\n\nAm I right that the algorithm is the speech here?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes, Your Honor. The -- well, I would say it's -- you know, the algorithm is a lot of things.\n\nThe algorithm has built within it -- it's -- it's basically how we predict what our customers want to see.\n\nJudge\nThe editorial discretion?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah --\n\nJudge\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- the editorial discretion.\n\nIt also has built within it the moderation elements.\n\nAll of this kind of comes together when the source code is translated into executable code in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, that executable code is then subject to vetting, review, moderation through content moderation algorithms.\n\nAnd that -- so it ultimately lands on the TikTok platform.\n\nJudge\nGot it.\n\nBut what we're -- what we're talking about as -- as in NetChoice is the editorial discretion that underlies the algorithm.\n\nAnd -- and I just want to be clear.\n\nA lot of your examples talk about, including the Bezos one --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\n-- the right of an American citizen to repeat what a foreign entity says or say, you know, I'm hitching my wagon to China; I want to say everything China does.\n\nHere, the concern is about the covert content manipulation piece of the algorithm.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\nThat is something that ByteDance wants to speak, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, Your Honor, I think that ultimately it's TikTok's choice whether to put it on the platform.\n\nAnd --\n\nJudge\nAnd you don't want that? Are you --is your client disclaiming any --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWe --we -- we absolutely resist any kind of content manipulation by China at all, but what I do want to focus in on is what -- their asserted interests here.\n\nThey do talk about covertness. But it can't possibly be that all they're concerned about is mere covertness.\n\nIf all you were concerned about was the covertness untethered from the underlying content, that's something that could be easily addressed through a risk disclosure.\n\nJudge\nBut that goes to scrutiny, the level of --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge\n-- the application.

So my concern is that leaving open that sort of legal fiction theory would permit again another change in the theory of this case and further litigation, which effectively robs Hungary of immunity from suit.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWhat is the total value of the property that is at issue in this case?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nIt's not entirely clear. In the complaint, plaintiffs allege it's in excess of $5 million.\r\n\r\nThere were fairly similar claims asserted in the Abelesz case in the Seventh Circuit, in which the plaintiffs claimed more specifically that it would run in the tens of billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nClass claims, especially with interest going back 80 years, could be so large as to be economically destabilizing, as the district court expressed.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nJustice Sotomayor?\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nJustice Kagan's questions suggest that having a viable cause of action for the victims, which I hope they do, and you explained to Justice Barrett you believe they do in Hungary, is a consideration we should have under this statute.\r\n\r\nBut I -- I take it that, from your whole presentation in your briefing and this afternoon, that the issue is really whether the U.S. should be that forum, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nThat's exactly right.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nAnd that the issue that's -- that we're -- when you say we're bound by the statutory language, is that to have a presence in the U.S. for an act that happened in Hungary 80 -- 60 or 80 years ago, that the property that was taken or exchanged has to be present in the United States, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nAs to Hungary, that's correct.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nAs -- as to Hungary.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, when a statute says you are required to return stolen property or any property exchanged for that stolen property, if I stole a car and sold it for $20,000 in cash, I don't have to trace where that $20,000 is.\r\n\r\nMy obligation at the end of the case is pay me the $20,000.\r\n\r\nI don't care where you got it -- you get it from.\r\n\r\nIf you lost that 20, but you have another bank account with another 20, you still have to pay me $20,000.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nAs a matter of -- of substantive law, when you have a claim against a person, that's correct.\r\n\r\nBut --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWhen we're talking about a fungible, an item that has been rendered fungible, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nWell, liability is in personam in a typical --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\n--civil case, so you're -- you're not actually looking at any specific res under those circumstance.\r\n\r\nHere, there is a requirement that you look to specific property.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nThat's the point, isn't it?

{"id": "891", "dialogue": "Judge: But it would work if the petitioner’s argument was a free-floating debt somewhere outside in the universe?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\nIf it were a debt owed to creditors generally, when you're doing a very simplistic valuation of a corporation, you would subtract the liabilities owed to creditors before determining the remaining equity value.\nBut here, we're looking at an equity stake and money paid to an equity stake, and you can't say that reduces the value of that equity stake or the corporation as a whole.\n\nJudge: Would your answer differ if the life insurance proceeds had been earmarked for the redemption of the shares?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\nThe parties' intent doesn't govern here.\nI think both we and the petitioner agree that the $3 million is actually an asset to the corporation. It does count. And we both agree on that.\nThe only question is whether it's offset by a debt or a liability, and for that purpose, I think it doesn't matter.\n\nJudge: Well, help me on that because I understand a hypothetical purchaser of the company as a whole would say: \"Ah, that $3 million is going to inure to my benefit because I'm just going to extinguish the redemption obligation, and off we go.\"\nBut if somebody's purchasing the shares at the time of the shareholder’s death, why isn’t it different then—because we're assessing the estate value, and there is an obligation to pay out with the insurance proceeds covering that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Absolutely.\nAnd the answer is that for all of the illustrations that we've suggested—whether it's a buyer of the company as a whole or a buyer of just the shareholder’s shares—you will always be able to capture the value of the insurance proceeds.\n\nJudge: Okay. But you agree the relevant measurement is the buyer of the shareholder’s shares?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, although, as the petitioner mentioned, we agree that it's a pro rata share of the company as a whole, so you will get the same number whether you value a buyer of the company as a whole and then take the shareholder’s pro rata share of that or value just the shares.\nEither way, a buyer who just buys those shares is going to get a 77 percent stake in a company with total assets of $6.86 million.\nSo, if that redemption obligation now runs to them, they will get cash in exchange for the 77 percent obligation.\nIf the redemption obligation is for some reason not honored, then they have a 77 percent stake in a company worth $6.86 million.\nBut the problem with the petitioner’s case is that they try to take $3 million out of that pot.\nThe problem is that the $3 million goes to the holder of those shares.\n\nJudge: Feel free to tell me this is the wrong question, but what's the net worth of the company after the shares are redeemed?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: On the petitioner’s view, it's $3.86 million, and you see this in the pie charts they have on their reply brief on page 6.\n\nJudge: Well, how about on your view?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: On our view, had the redemption been done at fair market value—which it was not—it would be $1.53 million.\nBut I think that picks up on a critical point, which is that our view, the government’s view, of how the estate tax works doesn't change how the parties had to structure their transactions.\nThey are free to redeem shares below fair market value for whatever business or idiosyncratic reasons they want to.\nBut the estate tax looks at what the fair market value of those shares was.\n\nJudge: So, after they get the life insurance proceeds and redeem the shares, the net worth of the company drops dramatically in your estimation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Explain that to me.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure, and I think this goes a little bit to your earlier questions about how a redemption is supposed to work.\nA redemption is essentially like a spinoff—you're dividing the corporate assets among existing shareholders.\nOne is getting cash in exchange for their share, and one gets sole ownership of a company worth less.\nIt is a problem for the petitioner that, even though that’s how a redemption is supposed to work in their view, the corporation maintains the same amount before and after.\nAnd the reason the problem comes up is because they claim the corporation is worth $3.86 million before, but it’s actually worth $6.86 million.\n\nJudge: I think it’s odd that you have a net worth of the company—what’s the net worth of the company in your view the day before the shareholder dies?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So just—I don't mean to pause, but the trickiness of it is trying to value the life insurance policies the day before death.\nThere’s a cash surrender value of the life insurance policies, which is approximately $500,000 the day before the shareholder dies.\nSo that’s a little bit tricky.\nBut putting aside any interest in the life insurance policies whatsoever, it’s around $3 million.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then, after death, even though they've bought the life insurance for exactly this purpose, the net worth of the company has dipped in half, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So two—\n\nJudge: That seems a little off. Maybe you say they just messed up, but the whole purpose of the life insurance policy was to make sure that didn’t happen, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So two responses to that. On the first point, if you're only looking at the company, it is correct that after the redemption, the company becomes a smaller company.\nThat’s how redemptions work.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Let me give you a plain language example.\n\nJudge: Is it with respect to the defendant?\n\nProsecutor: If I told you that I had just read a terrific book about Julius Caesar, I think you would expect that the book at least mentions Julius Caesar somewhere in there.\n\nJudge: No. (Laughter.)\n\nProsecutor: And if you learned that it's a book about ancient Romans—\n\nJudge: No, I wouldn’t—you know, it could be about his times and his place and the Roman Empire of the era.\n\nProsecutor: I think that's exactly right.\n\nJudge: Right?\n\nProsecutor: And that's my point.\n\nJudge: Okay. And I'm drawing an inference about him.\n\nProsecutor: That's right. That's exactly right. And that's how we think the rule operates here.\n\nJudge: You want us to draw—you want the jury to draw an inference about the mental state of this defendant, don't you?\n\nProsecutor: Yes. We are offering the testimony because it is relevant to the jury's assessment of the defendant’s own mental state, but that doesn't mean that it is an opinion about the defendant’s mental state.\n\nJudge: I would think that a great many district courts would, on that theory, say that this testimony should be stricken on 702 grounds. It's just not relevant.\n\nProsecutor: 704(b)—\n\nJudge: Is that what you're inviting?\n\nProsecutor: No, we are not inviting that.\n\nJudge: No, of course not, right?\n\nProsecutor: Indeed, the district court in this case—the defense made a Rule 401 objection to the relevancy of this testimony. The district court overruled it. The defense has not renewed that contention in this Court. I think there is testimony that is relevant to the jury's assessment of the defendant’s mental state that is nonetheless not testimony that is opining directly on the defendant’s mental state.\n\nJudge: Nor could the expert actually opine because he's not an examining expert. Isn't that right? I mean, there really isn't a world in which this expert could speak directly in a sense to what is going on in this defendant's mind. The only thing he is competent to testify about is, in his expertise, how these things work as a general matter, right?\n\nProsecutor: I think that's correct, and indeed in this particular case, the expert confirmed that he was not involved in the investigation of this case when he was asked that on cross-examination.\n\nJudge: Do you want to first answer the 100 percent case?\n\nProsecutor: Sure. So I think the defense is misreading our brief on that point. I mean, we think that the distinction between testifying in absolute terms or conditional terms about the way that drug traffickers operate is really more of a reliability issue. I don't think at this point in time we could sponsor any testimony—\n\nJudge: So, in fact, your argument would be the same if the expert got up and said, in my experience, 100 percent of the time drug traffickers use couriers who know that there are drugs in the car?\n\nProsecutor: Yeah, I think we would have the same Rule 704(b) position with respect to that testimony. And the key to the application of Rule 704(b)—\n\nJudge: So all defendants know that they have drugs, and—and you're still saying that’s not testimony about the defendant's mental state?\n\nProsecutor: Well, I want to be careful and precise here. If the expert testifies that all defendants know or that all drug traffickers, including this defendant, know—\n\nJudge: No, no, no. All mules, to use the common parlance—all mules know that there are drugs in their car.\n\nProsecutor: Yeah, I do—\n\nJudge: That’s still permissible under your view? It’s not about the defendant?\n\nProsecutor: It is not objectionable under Rule 704(b) grounds. It doesn't mean—\n\nJudge: The defendant just happens to be there. It just happens to be a trial in which that person is in jeopardy and—but we've got this testimony over here, and it doesn’t matter?\n\nJudge: Yeah, I don't understand that, right? Because isn't this necessarily saying 100 percent of defendants know? Aren't you necessarily saying this defendant knows?\n\nProsecutor: I think the distinction between those two—\n\nJudge: Apparently not.\n\nJudge: Isn't the answer that—\n\nJudge: Well, what is the answer? (Laughter.)\n\nProsecutor: Thank you. Look, I think the distinction between those two—the key point we're trying to get across is that Rule 704(b) forbids a particular form of opinion testimony. The expert cannot opine on the defendant's own mental state.

If you're requiring someone to reach a decision between 3 and 5:00, that's not a very good reason under the legal framework for delay.\n\nJudge: No, but let's say it happens really quickly, but it's a kangaroo court, an unfair adjudication.

Keep in mind—\n\nJudge: Help me write it so that we don’t do that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, because in past cases, the final hearing was going to be by a federal judge. You can trust that they are going to uphold the Constitution, they're going to do justice.

I mean, I’m sympathetic to your point that this is about how long it takes until someone can get an adjudication and their property back. That’s why people want a retention hearing—because it takes too long, even under the current framework, to have the final adjudication.\n\nJudge: We, in fact, have not decided this precise question. We could say that, despite similarities to past cases, this remains open to decide whether there ought to be a retention hearing in addition to the final adjudication.\n\nJudge: And we know more now than we did when past cases were decided—about how civil forfeiture is being used in some states, the abuses it's subject to, and the incentives operating on law enforcement officers that tend toward those abuses.\n\nJudge: So if we look around and see real problems that would be solved with a quick probable cause determination, why shouldn’t we do that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I would advise staying within the record of the case. There was ample process provided here. They could have posted a bond at any time to get the vehicles back.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If we rush the final hearing, it will cause serious problems. Speed sacrifices accuracy. The stakes in civil forfeiture are high—the government has a strong interest in full forfeiture and ensuring that crime doesn’t pay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If you have a less accurate retention hearing—essentially a mini-trial that’s faster but less precise—more property will be released to criminals, potentially misused again, and crime will increase.\n\nJudge: Why? First, I doubt that criminal defendants from whom cars have been taken will seek a retention hearing because whatever they say could be used against them in a criminal case.\n\nJudge: These cases matter most to one group—innocent owners. Many involve parents whose teenage children were involved in drug activity. Others involve spouses or friends.\n\nJudge: The government can present evidence ex parte if they suspect the owner is not innocent. But in the majority of cases, statistics show over 60 percent of innocent owners win, and they only get their cars back months or years later.\n\nJudge: So where does the legal framework account for those interests?

{"id": "292", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 22-448, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau versus the Community Financial Services Association.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision in this case is the first time any court in our nation's history has held that Congress violated the Appropriations Clause by enacting a statute providing funding. This Court should uphold the CFPB's funding statute because it is firmly grounded in constitutional text and in historical practice dating back to the founding.\n\nThe text of the Constitution shows that when the Framers wanted to limit Congress's appropriations authority, they did so expressly. And while the Framers restricted appropriations for the Army to two years, they applied no similar limits on appropriations for any other agency. History confirms that point.\n\nSince the founding, Congress has consistently funded agencies through standing appropriations that are not time-limited and that provide significant discretion over how much to spend. The first Congress did exactly this with the very first agency it created, the Customs Service, and the same is true for other founding-era agencies, including the Post Office, the National Mint, the Patent Office, revenue officers, and the National Bank.\n\nCongress has used this kind of appropriation as the default when funding financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The CFPB's appropriation fits squarely within this unbroken line of historical practice.\n\nIn fact, Congress exercised significantly more discretion and control over the Bureau's funding by capping its annual appropriation in an amount that is far lower than many other agencies' budgets.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Respondents argue that the combination of features in the CFPB statute violates some previously unrecognized constitutional line. But the Bureau's appropriation is materially identical to the numerous funding statutes just listed, and Respondents concede those statutes are constitutional.\n\nThis Court should reject Respondents' attempt to gerrymander a rule to fit the CFPB alone without providing a coherent theory about how to interpret and apply the Appropriations Clause.\n\nJudge: General, other than passing an appropriations law, are there any limits on what Congress can do?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: At the outset, as your question touches on, the term \"appropriation\" itself contains some essential requirements. That term is defined to mean a law that provides for funding and that specifies both the source and the purpose of the funding.\n\nThat's how an appropriation was defined at the founding, it's how it's always been understood, and that's still how it's defined today in sources like the GAO Red Book, which is Congress's own appropriations treatise. So we think that at the outset, it's not just any old law but a law that contains those features that constitutes an appropriation.\n\nThen I think the question becomes, are there other limits out there on how Congress can structure funding for particular types of activities or government functions? We know, obviously, from the Army Appropriations Clause that the answer is yes. With respect to that particular government function, there's a durational limit, and it's based on the nature of the activity because the Framers were specifically concerned about having a standing Army.\n\nBut I think the Army Appropriations Clause itself demonstrates that there are not otherwise constraints in the Appropriations Clause that would limit Congress in how it decides to structure the funding.\n\nJudge: So, beyond the initial almost skeletal requirements of duration and purpose, there isn't—if I hear you right, there is no other condition?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We don't think that the Appropriations Clause places those limits on Congress itself when it enacts a funding statute, but I do want to emphasize that our argument here also relies heavily on history.\n\nSo, if you have in mind some kind of funding statute or arrangement that's never been done in all of this nation's history, I think the Court could take that into account in a future case.\n\nHere, though, we have a specific type of appropriation, a capped lump-sum appropriation that’s standing for a single agency, and our historical argument is that this is nothing new or unprecedented. All of the agencies previously listed had similar appropriations.\n\nJudge: Is there any role that appropriations play in the separation of powers? It seems that, at least when I was in the executive branch, Congress exercised appropriations to check the executive branch to some extent. In the case of the CFPB, how would that play out?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I do agree and think that, of course, it's a critical element of—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —the separation of powers that Congress has control over the purse.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Our argument here is that Congress has exercised that power. This Court, of course, is looking at a statute that Congress itself enacted that set up this funding mechanism for the CFPB, which is similar in kind to the way that Congress has funded other financial regulatory agencies.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I mean --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, you would address it by saying, even if it doesn't include -- even if \"person\" doesn't include governments in 1681q, as the courts below have said, that has no bearing on 1681n and o.\nIt's not plausible to infer the absence of -- of the definition in the criminal context -- I'm sorry, the absence of the application of the definition in the criminal context to the -- to the civil context. You need a -- you need a different reason.\n\nJudge: And that includes punitive damages?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, punitive damages is also a clear statement rule requirement.

Justice Barrett?\n\nJudge: No.\n\nJudge: Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: No.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. Snyder, we'll give you three minutes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you. A few quick points.\nFirst, as suggested, one of the purposes for the clear statement rule is to make sure that Congress has specifically considered the question of whether it wants to waive sovereign immunity and addressed that.\nOne of the reasons to require specific references to sovereign entities in the cause of action itself is to make sure that Congress has made that conscious decision.\n\nNow my opponent acknowledged that there is a specificity requirement. He just thinks that it's satisfied here in the Act-wide definition. The problem with that understanding is that it asks for specificity about the wrong thing.\n\nThe definition that Congress adopted in 1970 does make clear that in some references, the FCRA does cover the government, but it doesn't make clear that Congress was specifically focused on waiving the United States' sovereign immunity because it had nothing to do with liability at the time it was adopted.\n\nThere was also a suggestion that perhaps the word \"person\" means every -- or means the same thing in all parts of the statute, but there are just defenses that exist under the criminal provision perhaps that would exempt the government from liability there.\n\nWe think that's right. We just think that the same thing is true with 1681n and o, that the fact that \"person\" in those provisions might include the sovereign does not answer the separate question of whether the sovereign has defenses to civil liability any more than it answers the question of whether the sovereign might have defenses to criminal liability.\n\nAnd, finally, my opponent tried to distinguish Employees. I think, as was alluded to, his arguments sound a lot like the dissent in Employees, which accused the majority opinion of engaging in ritualism by focusing very carefully on exactly what was and was not in the statutory text. But, of course, this Court's decisions today follow the approach that the majority took there, not the dissent.\n\nAnd one other distinction that he attempted to draw was that in Employees, the statute allowed for enforcement by the FTC. But, of course, that's my opponent's position as well.

{"id": "653", "dialogue": "Judge:\nAnd how is it that Respondent's argument is using \"final\" to limit?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I think the Respondent have said \"final\" means res judicata effect, or Respondent -- or that \"final\" means appealability.\n\nJudge:\nThat it must affect the parties -- it's the sort of certain kinds of proceedings is what --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\n-- Respondent looks -- uses \"final\" to do, and that, therefore, limits the district court's ability to address after the fact those kinds of cases?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nI think -- I think my friends are trying to inject in the first step of whether Rule 60(b) is even available a test as to whether there's an effect on the legal rights when the intent was clear to make 60(b) as broad as possible in terms of which orders, matter, or proceedings could be reexamined and to make very clear that the circumstances in which they could be reexamined would be narrow and they would have to be -- to meet the 60(b)(1) through (6) test in the court's -- in the discretion of the district court.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you read \"orders, judgments, and proceedings\" not as some sort of, you know, strict list but, really, Congress trying to say pretty much everything? Waterfront?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nAnd I -- that's how the California Supreme Court interpreted it under the Court's decision in Hall versus Hall. The -- the -- the -- the court takes notice when the advisory committee notes takes a provision from a statute or other source, puts it into the federal rules, and holds that that is intentional and carries the soil with it.\n\nAt least as a presumptive matter, the decisions of the California Supreme Court interpreting \"proceeding\" to cover everything and specifically applying their version of the -- of the code, which had the same operative language, to cover voluntary dismissals is strong evidence that that was intended by the rule-makers. And, of course, we -- we also rely on the word \"judgment\" and not just \"proceeding\" because, as I said, at the time, judgments were defined to include voluntary dismissals, and -- and -- and that was the settled meaning in 1937, and that's the way California's Supreme Court talked about it too.\n\nJudge:\nCan I go back to -- a bit to the previous question.\n\nThere's some superfluity in your definition, but there is also in the other side's because every proceeding would encompass a judgment and an order, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\nOr a judgment and order would -- because they require there to be some sort of judicial intervention as I understand, that would -- that would mean that every proceeding would -- encompasses judgment and orders as well and vice versa.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think that both interpretations -- all the interpretations we've seen have some surplusage, and in that circumstance, the Court has said the canon against surplusage doesn't apply.\n\nWhat I will say is we do give independent meaning to \"judgment, order, and proceeding\" because they don't all mean the same thing in our view of the world.\n\nJudge:\nWell, and you have some support for that because one of the provisions of this Act talks about the date of the -- the date of the proceeding as opposed to the entry of the judgment or order, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nThat's Rule 60(c)(1).\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nWith -- I guess, with respect to this question of finality, the other side relies very much on the definition of 1291, and 1291 doesn't seem quite as apt an analogy to me as one would think because that has to do more with what is the jurisdiction between a district court and an appellate court.\n\nAnd that's very different here because this is about the jurisdiction of a district court, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's exactly right.\n\nJudge:\nAnd so I guess what -- when you're pointing to the California cases and to the -- to the California cases and to the advisory notes, you're saying you should look at finality in the way that Congress was using it, which is case-ending finality rather than legal determination finality, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWe're -- we're looking -- we meet -- we do endorse the case-ending finality concept and -- and also whether, as Professor Moore stated, there is inherent authority to modify --\n\nJudge:\nIt can't be the ending of the controversy because, otherwise, there wouldn't be jurisdiction, which they admit there is.\n\nIf a court signs a judgment dismissing without prejudice, which it does regularly, that doesn't end the legal responsibility between the parties, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nAnd there -- there are many orders that are deemed final for appellate purposes or -- or otherwise that can be refiled that are nonetheless deemed final because they terminate the case.\n\nAnd the Court has said that in its decisions interpreting the appellate statutes, which --\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nAnything further?

And that's a question for the Court because it's a constitutional question, is the statute doing this, right?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nI completely agree with that, Justice Jackson.\n\nThat's precisely why we think heightened scrutiny applies here, because this is a statute that on its face draws that --\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nAnd to answer the question is this statute doing this, I understood that we had a sort of two-step framework for looking at it, that we don't just kind of launch into an assessment of the evidence or what the state is -- why the state is saying that they're doing this or the scientific basis for it, that we're looking at something else when we're trying to determine is a classification being made, right?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd I guess my real concern, and I -- maybe I'll just ask you to react to my Loving parallel because I'm getting kind of nervous -- is that in Loving, those same kinds of scientific arguments were made.\n\nSo I'm -- I'm reading here where the Court says: \"The argument is that if the Equal Protection Clause does not outlaw miscegenation statutes because of their reliance on racial classifications, the question of constitutionality would thus become whether there was any rational basis for a state to treat interracial marriages differently from other marriages.\n\nOn this question, the State argues the scientific evidence is substantially in doubt and, consequently, the Court should defer to the wisdom of the state legislature in adopting its policy of discouraging interracial marriages.\" And so, for me, this kind of idea that the way we look at it is not, first, are you drawing these classifications and then, State, give us your evidence so we can make sure that there's a proper fit.\n\nIf, instead, we're just sort of doing what the state is encouraging here in Loving, where you just sort of say, well, there are lots of good reasons for this policy and who are we as the Court to say otherwise, I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.\n\nDefendant:\nI -- I share your concerns, Justice Jackson.\n\nAnd I think one of the things that's happening in this case is we're seeing a lot of concerns that come in at step two of the analysis being imported into that threshold question of whether a classification has been drawn in the first instance.\n\nConcerns about real differences between males and females, that is exactly what heightened scrutiny is -- is intended to test in the application of heightened scrutiny.\n\nIf Tennessee can have an end run around heightened scrutiny by asserting at the outset that biology justifies the sex-based differential in the law, that would undermine decades of this Court's precedent.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Tennessee lawmakers enacted SB1 to protect minors from risky, unproven medical interventions.\n\nThe law imposes an across-the-board rule that allows the use of drugs and surgeries for some medical purposes but not for others.\n\nJudge:\nBoth the SG and Petitioner have suggested that a better approach would be the approach of West Virginia.

{"id": "59", "dialogue": "Judge: If we thought that a reasonable way to deal with this really quite difficult situation is for the government to do what it does on the merits part of the cases and go in and tell the judge in camera why the person was listed and why the person was taken off and what it has to say about why the person won't be taken off, do you know anything about how that process works? Is counsel part of that process typically when it's a substantive issue? And do you want to say anything about whether counsel has to be part of that process?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor.\nA few thoughts. The government, generally speaking, does provide some kind of explanation as to the reasons for a person's watchlisting publicly even.\nAnd so this is an exceptional case where they provided no information at all. In other watchlist cases, the government, for example, in a prior case, provided an extensive series of ex parte in camera declarations to supplement some of the public descriptions, and I believe there was a mixture of access that was provided to counsel in that case. But some of the information that gets disclosed ends up being designated as sensitive security information.\nWe've gotten cleared on that basis. But, you know, there are all those options, but the government had all those options before they got to this Court.\nAnd so, before 2018, they decided— in the first application of voluntary cessation doctrine to this case, they didn't provide any declaration. After the first application, they provided this declaration. And so we think that the government had the opportunity to muster what evidence it wanted on the mootness question, and it's provided this to the Court.\n\nJudge: Have you suggested any of these alternatives or offered to reach an accommodation with the government in this case in this fashion?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I believe there is a protective order in place currently at the— or there was—\n\nJudge: Beyond a standard protective order, have you made any attempts to settle this case with the government?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, we have. We've done—I think, before the appellate court's decision, there was a mediation, and the mediation was in part about what the government was willing to say, and it turns out that the government is not willing to say a word more than what's in the declaration they provided.\n\nJudge: Worth a try. (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: Can we go back to an earlier question? What's the remedy you're seeking and how do you have standing for that remedy?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Let's clarify. Are you seeking an injunction? Are you seeking just a declaration? And why would the declaration not violate the law that the other side claims it would?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\nWe're seeking an injunction and a declaratory judgment. The injunction is the same injunction that we saw at the beginning of the case to prevent the government from using the unlawful reasons that it did to list him and from using the same unlawful procedures that it did previously. And the reason that injunction is still viable and live is because the voluntary cessation doctrine isn't exactly an exception to mootness.\nIt's when mootness exists.\nAnd so, here, the plaintiff has an interest in the government not returning to its old ways, and so he maintains the interest in the injunction. But there's even more concrete things. The government, by standing by its prior decision, indicates an interest in continuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that the government is likely to consider about the plaintiff when it runs into him in the future is the fact that the government for a period of five years put him on the No Fly List.\nAnd so the Court, this Court or another, lower courts, can order the government to not use his past No Fly List status for any particular purpose. Annotate the records—that's something that the government has been ordered to do by a court in a prior case after the only No Fly List trial in this nation's history.\nThe trial judge ordered the government to annotate the No Fly List record that still existed, expunge the ones that they could.\nAnd so we think that there's plenty for the Court to do on the injunctive side. On the declaratory judgment side, the plaintiff, the reason he brought this lawsuit was so that he could go about his everyday life, and that is what ran him into the No Fly List.\nA decision, a declaratory judgment spelling out what the government's authorities are, what the plaintiff's rights should be, will have meaning to him.\n\nJudge: I still don't understand exactly what you want.\nYou wouldn't be satisfied simply with an injunction that says the government is enjoined from using evidence that would be in violation of the First Amendment? That wouldn't satisfy you, right?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI think we would have to get very specific.\n\nJudge: All right.\nSo suppose one of the reasons why he was put on was that he traveled to a certain country, and suppose the passage of time convinced the government that the fact that he traveled there at some point—I'm just speculating, this is not connected to the real facts—but let's suppose that that's the case. The passage of time means that having traveled there in the past was no longer much—carried much probative weight and, therefore, he didn't deserve to continue to be on the No Fly List.\nSo what do you want? Do you want, like, an advisory opinion, if you go back there, you might get back on, or, if you go to any other country about which there might be some suspicion, if you go to another flagged country, maybe that'll put you over the top? What exactly do you think could possibly be done?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yeah, it's—I think it's a difficult fact-intensive question about what injunction would be appropriate, but the injunction might be at a higher level of generality.\nPerhaps it's the government being required to make a showing of criminal conduct as part of a person's listing. So I think that there are possibilities—\n\nJudge: Well, that would be a huge change.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: That would be a change.\nAnd I'm just doing that—\n\nJudge: That would be dramatic. Not to interrupt.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yeah.\nAnd I'm just doing that as an illustrative change of something that the government could do that would not be specific to this plaintiff's case. But the opposite is also true.\nThe government could do something that's only specific to this plaintiff.\nFor example, if the procedural safeguards that the Court put in place— that the government put in place—were not generally applicable but were only specific to this plaintiff, this Court could look at those procedural safeguards and say, hey, before the government relists him, they're going to call this lawyer and they're going to call—it's going to go to this committee and they're going to make sure that the terms of the declaration are implemented.\nSo there's a way for the government to do it specific to this plaintiff.\nThere's a way for the government to do it program-wide.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "824", "dialogue": "Judge: 2401 is a very broad statute that applies to every civil action against the United States, and as I understand your argument, you want us to say that the term \"accrue\" means something different in different contexts. Have we ever said anything like that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the Court said basically that in Crown Coat Front Company, interpreting 2401. It said that \"accrues\" is a general word, that it's hazardous to try to give it one definition for all purposes and that instead you have to interpret it in the light of the specific statute at issue.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And if I could point you to Section 2401(b), which is the provision governing tort claims against the United States, that similarly uses the word \"accrues,\" and the Court has acknowledged in that context that different claims are subject to different accrual rules.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, in United States versus Kubrick, the Court said that most tort claims against the United States accrue at the time of injury but that some accrue at the time the injury is discovered in the context of medical malpractice, for example. So the Court has acknowledged that \"accrues\" can lead to different accrual rules for different kinds of claims.\n\nJudge: An argument that the plaintiff makes is that if this were also destabilizing, as you suggest, we would have seen that already because there can always be enforcement actions in which a party can defend itself by saying that the rule is invalid. So why hasn't that—why is this so much more destabilizing than that sort of regime?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because, first of all, this applies in contexts where there aren't going to be enforcement proceedings, so, for example, the permit context that I mentioned. The plaintiff’s rule would apply in that context, and I think that alone would make it pretty destabilizing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But I also think it's just the case that there are far fewer enforcement actions than there are regulated entities, and so allowing every new regulated entity to bring a facial challenge would significantly expand the number of claims that you would see.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The other point that the plaintiff has made about why you shouldn't think this is going to lead to bad results is that there's been experience in the Sixth Circuit. I do want to address that. The Sixth Circuit, courts in the Sixth Circuit have not understood Herr to adopt the rule that the plaintiff is arguing for, and the best evidence I can give you of that is that a newly incorporated pizzeria filed suit against Regulation II in Kentucky in 2022, and the court, applying Herr, said that claim, materially identical to this one, is untimely because Herr dealt with as-applied challenges as opposed to facial challenges like this one.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there's just nowhere in the country that you can look to see what the plaintiff's rule would look like.\n\nJudge: And—\n\nJudge: Oh. Go ahead.\n\nJudge: Is your rule of accrual completely desegregated from injury? Because you agree, right, as a matter of the APA and Article III that a plaintiff can't actually even bring a suit unless the plaintiff has been injured, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. That’s true. I mean, our accrual rule is the same accrual rule that Congress has called for in the context of the Hobbs Act.\n\nJudge: I know, I know, I know. But we're talking about 2401. And in Crown Point, the entitlement to payment didn't arise until at the point where we said it accrued. So, you know, there's language in Crown Point that helps you, but on the actual facts of the case, that was when the injury was complete.\n\nJudge: And so—but—what I want to know is, would this be the only time for purposes of 2401, as opposed to things like the Hobbs Act, where we would have interpreted \"accrue\" to be separate from injury? Like, what if the government delayed enforcement and there wasn't an injury yet, for example?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I’m not aware of another case in which this Court has interpreted 2401(a) to sort of go in either direction. I mean, in Crown Coat Front Company, the accrual point was both the point of injury and the time of agency action. So we're not suggesting that Crown Coat Front Company by its holding resolves it between those two.\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "887", "dialogue": "Judge\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-997, Stanley versus the City of Sanford.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ADA permits former employees in Lieutenant Stanley's shoes to challenge discrimination in post-employment benefits. There are at least two paths to that conclusion here.\n\nFirst, the narrow path is to recognize that former employees may sue when they allege that they were discriminated against as qualified individuals while still employed. After she was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2016 and before she retired as a firefighter in 2018, Lieutenant Stanley was indisputably a qualified individual.\n\nDuring that period, she was subject to a policy that she alleges reduced her compensation in a discriminatory manner.\n\nUnder the ADA, former employees may challenge such discrimination even if they are no longer employed by the time they bring suit.\n\nIf the Court adopts this rationale, it should make clear that it is not foreclosing the possibility that an employee may also challenge discrimination that, unlike here, occurs entirely after their last day on the job.\n\nSecond, if the Court chooses to resolve this case on a broader rationale, it should hold that former employees may challenge post-employment discrimination.\n\nRead in context, as the City rightly concedes it must be, the \"qualified individual\" definition ensures that employers can make necessary job-related decisions, but it doesn't license discrimination unrelated to job performance or impose a temporal limitation on the ADA's protections.\n\nCongress made a choice to prohibit discrimination in post-employment benefits, benefits that are crucial to recruiting people to take on dangerous jobs like firefighting and policing.\n\nYet, under the City's reading, the ADA's protections for these benefits mean the least precisely when they matter most.\n\nCongress did not enact such a self-defeating scheme. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge\nDid the courts below decide your first point?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nThe Eleventh Circuit discussed this argument but did not reach it. The Eleventh Circuit, erroneous in our view, believed that the argument hadn't been properly presented because it appeared in an amicus brief by the United States.\n\nBut that brief by the United States was filed two days before Lieutenant Stanley filed her opening brief, and her opening brief fully incorporated that argument.\n\nIn fact, the first page of the brief was a statement of adoption, adopting the government's arguments.\n\nAnd then Lieutenant Stanley referred to that in her summary of argument and argument. And it was a focus of the oral argument below.\n\nJudge\nDo courts normally adopt the positions of amicus to fill in gaps in the parties' briefs?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nNo, I think -- well, I think in the lower courts at least.\n\nAs we just saw in this Court, sometimes an amicus does play that role.\n\nBut, in the lower courts, conventionally, no.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit was applying a rule that simply because something is presented as in an amicus brief doesn't mean the court has to reach it.\n\nBut this is a different scenario, as I just described, because the amicus brief was filed first, the position was fully adopted in the opening brief, and it was discussed at oral argument.\n\nSo I think, under this Court's formulation of pressed or passed below, it was pressed and it is available to this Court to reissue.\n\nJudge\nWhen you sought cert here, did you make that argument, or did you simply point out the split between the circuits as to whether former employees can bring an action under the ADA?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYour Honor, this issue was ventilated in the cert papers.\n\nI think, if you look at the brief in opposition at page 30 through 31, there's an extensive discussion of this.\n\nWe discussed it at pages 24 through 25 of the petition and also in the certiorari reply at page 9.\n\nSo I think we understood the Court in granting the case to be granting the case including that argument.\n\nAnd it is an answer to the question presented that would resolve at least part of the circuit split below.\n\nJudge\nCounsel, isn't -- oh.\n\nJudge\nNo, go ahead.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nIsn't this a different scenario as well -- you said this was a different scenario in terms of the Eleventh Circuit's waiver argument -- because we're talking about fundamentally a motion to dismiss and whether or not Ms. Stanley plausibly alleged discrimination.\n\nAnd so I guess I'm a little confused by the Eleventh Circuit's waiver analysis in that context.\n\nI don't know what they mean that she waived her ability to make this argument by not raising it before the district court, because the district court's task was just to determine whether or not she had plausibly alleged facts that would support a theory of discrimination under the ADA, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah, and I think that's another way that this Court can approach this issue which you often say, which is that as long as a party has preserved a claim, the party can make legal arguments in support of that claim.\n\nAnd that's true in this Court even when the refinements happen here.\n\nBut, in this case, the legal argument was presented to the court of appeals.\n\nAnd so I think it is --\n\nJudge\nAnd they somehow suggested that it was not available to her in that way because she had not made that particular argument in support of her claim below, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nRight.\n\nJudge\n-- below, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah, and the rule that they invoked, as I said in my answer to Justice Thomas, was this rule that, you know, we don't reach an argument simply because it's in the amicus brief.\n\nBut I think that doesn't accurately describe what happened here because Lieutenant Stanley was, in fact, pressing the argument.\n\nAnd as I said, it was also fleshed out at the certiorari stage.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "520", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?\r\n\r\nJudge: But do you concede that you would have a problem or not depending upon how the statute is worded? I mean, we're in a statutory scheme here. We're not just doing aiding-and-abetting liability as a matter of common law. Don't you agree?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I do agree with that, Justice Jackson, but I think the fact that we're in a statutory scheme is an important element of centering this case where it is now. That's why I said earlier we are at the beginning of the beginning of this case.\r\n\r\nJudge: No, I understand.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There's a statute --\r\n\r\nJudge: I guess I just -- just quickly in response to what Justice Kavanaugh was just exploring with you, the facts that he laid out seem to me to be covered by this particular PLCAA immunity, that Congress looked at that situation and said, you know, the term \"qualified civil liability action,\" which you can't bring in court, means a civil action resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person of a third party. So, in other words, Congress started with Justice Kavanaugh's example, you know, my product is being used by third parties in criminal ways. And they said immunity. They said immunity. And so --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They said --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- and so to read the exception to that as essentially capturing the same facts, if you know that your product is going to these people, seems odd to me.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice Jackson, what Congress said was immunity unless. And the predicate exception that we've been talking about says immunity unless the manufacturer is alleged, among other things, to have aided and abetted violations of federal gun laws.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It's that -- that's the important point.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Rebuttal, Mr. Francisco?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points.\r\n\r\nFirst, Justice Thomas, as to one of your questions, if they're right under PLCAA, this would, in fact, revive the exact same lawsuits that PLCAA was meant to prohibit. If you look at Texas's -- Mexico's complaint, the underlying torts alleged, which is what they're seeking relief on, are the exact same torts that were at issue in all of the other cases. The violations only come in in their effort to get around PLCAA and fit with one of its exceptions.\r\n\r\nBut, if you accept their interpretation of the PLCAA exception, you will have revived exactly the same type of lawsuit that PLCAA was meant to prohibit when they adopted this statute in the first place.\r\n\r\nSecondly, my friend talked about some paragraphs in their complaint, but I think that their complaint makes quite clear what their basic aiding-and-abetting theory is. Paragraph 228 -- and this is a allegation that they repeat throughout -- \"each defendant's policy is to sell its guns to any and all federal firearms licensees.\" That is anyone that the federal government says that we can sell to. So their allegation is that we're treating all retailers exactly the same.\r\n\r\nWe're not treating any one better than any other. We're treating them the same.\r\n\r\nThat's important because, in Twitter, the Court made quite clear that the reason they didn't get across the aiding-and-abetting line was because there was no allegation that they were treating ISIS, who they knew to a metaphysical certainty was on their platform, they weren't treating ISIS any better or worse than any other customer.\r\n\r\nInstead, they go on -- and this is paragraph 110 -- to explain their theory. \"A manufacturer of a dangerous product is an accessory or co-conspirator to illicit conduct by downstream actors where it continues to supply, support, or assist the downstream parties and has knowledge, actual or constructive, of the illicit conduct.\" I think that's the mere knowledge theory that my friend was just referring to, Justice Kavanaugh.\r\n\r\nThat, however, is the theory that the Court squarely rejected in the Twitter case.\r\n\r\nTurning to foreseeability, Mr. Chief Justice, there was an exchange with my friend on the case law, where I think what I heard her say was that an intervening independent act didn't break the chain if it was foreseeable.\r\n\r\nWell, I would say that that is completely inconsistent with this Court's repeated statement that foreseeability alone isn't the standard.\r\n\r\nIt's also completely independent with the Hemi Group case that did not involve a derivative injury. New York City was the only plaintiff that could sue for the lost taxes that New York City suffered. There was absolutely no other plaintiff that would have been able to pursue that remedy and that loss.\r\n\r\nYet this Court held that the intervening independent act did break the chain.\r\n\r\nLexmark is no different. It did not involve an intervening independent act. If I trick consumers into not buying my competitors' products, I've directly harmed my competitor. There is no intervening independent act.\r\n\r\nAs to the various treaties, I would agree, Justice Sotomayor, with your suggestion that the law in the verbal formulations here are kind of a mess. But, if you actually look at the cases that the treatises cite for their assertion that foreseeability alone is the standard, they don't cite this Court's cases, which is kind of surprising, if what they're supposed to be doing is describing the law rather than making the law.\r\n\r\nBut the cases that they do cite principally involve special relationships, like a landlord/tenant relationship or a teacher/student relationship. They don't cite any case in which a manufacturer has been held liable because some criminal unlawfully misuses its product to harm somebody else.\r\n\r\nMy friend, again, emphasized the Washington Post article. I would urge you to read that article from beginning to end. I think it's very helpful in illuminating how even their theory of mere knowledge doesn't make sense. My friend also talked about three pistols sold by Colt with Spanish-named firearms.\r\n\r\nThe notion that selling a Spanish-named firearm is what gives rise to joint purpose with cartels under the aiding-and-abetting statute is as wrong as it is offensive. There are, after all, millions of perfectly law-abiding Spanish-speaking Americans in this country that find those firearms very attractive.\r\n\r\nAnd making those firearms available cannot possibly cross the line into aiding-and-abetting liability. But, even if it could, the notion that selling three Spanish-named pistols is the proximate cause of cartel violence in Mexico is, frankly, absurd, and I don't think it comes even close to establishing Twombly's plausibility standard.\r\n\r\nMy final point is just to step back and talk about what PLCAA was really about. At the end of the day, PLCAA is about protecting Second Amendment rights. It's not just about protecting the manufacturers, the distributors, and the retailers, but it's protecting the right of every American to exercise their right under the Second Amendment to possess and bear firearms.\r\n\r\nThat right is meaningless if there are no manufacturers, retailers, and distributors that provide them in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you reverse.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nThe case is submitted.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "91", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only question presented is whether Stanley has alleged discrimination against the qualified individual under the ADA.\n\nThe answer to that question is yes.\n\nWe agree with Stanley that the most straightforward path to that conclusion lies in the period after she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease but before she retired.\n\nIn that period, Stanley was a qualified individual with a disability.\n\nAnd there's no dispute that if the alleged discrimination occurred while Stanley was both qualified and disabled, the alleged discrimination was against a qualified individual.\n\nThe Court can, and should, decide this case on that narrow basis, but, in doing so, it shouldn't foreclose the possibility of relief in other cases involving plaintiffs who were not both qualified and disabled when the disability discrimination occurred.\n\nWe believe the ADA also protects the benefits those plaintiffs earned as qualified individuals, but, because the alleged discrimination here occurred while Stanley was both qualified and disabled, this Court need not address any broader arguments to vacate the decision below.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Where did Petitioner make those arguments in the district court and in the court of appeals?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nSo, in the district court, we think this --this argument is supported in paragraph 16 of the complaint. That paragraph of the complaint alleges that she became disabled before she retired and also alleges that she continued to work until she retired. We think it's a plausible inference from that paragraph that she was a qualified individual with a disability at some point before she retired.\n\nIn the court of appeals, I would look at Romanette 8 and page 10 of her opening brief, pages 4 to 13 of her reply brief, and I would listen to the first five minutes of the oral argument below, in which Stanley herself described the path I'm identifying here as \"the narrowest path to a decision in her favor.\" And then, in this Court, I would -- I would cite the same pages my friend cited in the petition, particularly pages 7, 11, 24, and 25. I would note that the City argued forfeiture in its brief in opposition.\n\nPresumably, this Court considered and rejected that forfeiture contention as a basis for denying review and for good reason, because this Court has said time and again that once a party has preserved an issue for this Court's consideration, that party can make any argument in support of that issue.\n\nAnd the issue here is whether Stanley satisfies the qualified individual requirement.\n\nI want to emphasize why we think it's a good idea to decide this case narrowly.\n\nFirst, we think it answers the question presented.\n\nSecond, we do think it would go a long way to resolving the circuit split.\n\nThat's identified at page 17A of the petition appendix.\n\nAnd the split implicates two decisions from the Sixth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, the McKnight decision and the Weyer decision, which both held that former employees categorically cannot sue to enforce Title I.\n\nAnd so, if this Court were to hold that at least someone in Stanley's circumstances can sue even though she was a former employee when she brought the suit, that would resolve that question that's divided the circuits.\n\nJudge: Could she sue if she had not filed within 300 days?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I do, Justice Alito, I -- I have the same two responses my friend did.\n\nI think it's unnecessary to reach that -- that interpretation of the Fair Pay Act because there are 86 days in the 300 -day limitation period that fall during the period after she was diagnosed but before she was disabled, and those may well be days that support her claim here.\n\nBut, to get to the interpretation of the Fair Pay Act, we understand the Fair Pay Act as saying that you can identify a discriminatory decision that falls outside the limitations period, that is, a decision that satisfies all the elements of discrimination under 12112(a). And so long as you can point to effects from that decision that do fall within the limitation period, then you can challenge that decision.\n\nWe -- we understand that to be the force of the Fair Pay Act in a context like this.\n\nJudge: I don't want to take up too much time, but I am interested in the last questions -- the last series of questions I asked Mr. Gupta.\n\nSo, in this case -- because I want to understand where this leads.\n\nIn -- in this case, Lieutenant Stanley is actually treated more favorably than someone who retires after 20 years without a -- for a reason other than disability.\n\nShe is treated less favorably than someone who retires after working for 25 years.\n\nSo how is a court -- put aside -- there's no question of -- of bias, and the -- the -- the employer puts that -- puts forward information that this is based on cost saving and incentivizing working until 25.\n\nHow is a --what is the test for determining whether something like that is valid or not? The reasonable accommodation concept would work in the employment context, but it doesn't work here.\n\nSo what's the answer?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yeah, I don't think this is a reasonable accommodation claim.\n\nI don't think Stanley has ever brought a reasonable accommodation claim.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nIt's not reasonable accommodation.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: So how do you determine whether this kind of a structure is -- is discriminatory?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So we understand this to be a disparate treatment claim, and we understand that the right way to go about analyzing a disparate treatment claim is to ask how a similarly situated person without disabilities would be treated.\n\nAnd, as you know, the United States hasn't taken a position on this issue, but I -- I understand the parties to have staked out two different ways of identifying the relevant similarly situated comparator.\n\nI think, if you ask Petitioner, what they would say is: What you do is you subtract disability from the equation and you see what would have happened then.\n\nAnd, in their view, if you subtract disability from the equation, their client, Stanley, would have worked more than 25 years and, thus, been eligible for benefits until she was 65.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "363", "dialogue": "Judge:\nI -- I think that the record shows that the -- the discordance between a person's birth sex and gender identity has a strong biological basis and would satisfy an immutability test.\n\nAnd I also think, under this Court's precedents for determining whether something is a suspect or quasi-suspect classification, a distinguishing characteristic is sufficient.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nDoes the category of -- does transgender status apply to individuals who are gender fluid?\n\nDefendant:\nI think that the -- the distinguishing characteristic is to have a birth sex that does not align with -- or a gender that does not align with one's birth sex.\n\nSo it may include people who have different understandings of -- of their gender identity, but I think it is still the distinguishing characteristic of a birth sex and a gender identity that are incongruent.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAre there individuals who are born male, assigned male at birth, who at one point identify as female but then later come to identify as male, and, likewise, for individuals who are assigned female at birth, at some point identify as male -- as female -- I'm sorry -- identify as male but later come to identify as female? Are there not such people?\n\nDefendant:\nThere are such people. I agree with that, Your Honor.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo it's not an immutable characteristic, is it?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, I think people's understanding of it -- of it shifts, but the evidence shows that there is at least a strong underlying basis.\n\nAnd I think the normative reason for that particular consideration is whether or not this is something that someone should or could change and whether they should have to change it in order to receive constitutional protections, and I think transgender status squarely fits within that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWe -- we have said that having a disability is not a suspect or quasi-suspect classification, so, if we were to agree with you on the question of quasi -suspect classification, how could we justify saying, for example, that a person who is schizophrenic does not fall within a category that --that -- that is not a law that --that distinguishes on that ground is not a suspect classification? And I'm not suggesting that gender dysphoria is a disease, a mental illness.\n\nI'm not suggesting that at all.\n\nI'm just saying, how could we justify the different treatment?\n\nDefendant:\nI -- I think that --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt's -- it's immutable in the sense that there isn't any cure for it. There's been severe discrimination against people suffering from schizophrenia.\n\nAt one point, they were locked up in hellish institutions.\n\nThey can make a valuable contribution to society.\n\nThink of John Nash.\n\nHow would we distinguish that?\n\nDefendant:\nYour Honor, what I think would be the difference is that in -- in Cleburne, the Court in essence said as to the distinguishing characteristic that this was a large and diffuse group of individuals who have different forms of -- of --of disabilities and that that group of people had been able to secure some protection through -- through the legislative process.\n\nBut, again, this Court certainly does not have to reach the question of -- of transgender status as a quasi-suspect classification.\n\nSB1 on its face hinges its prohibition on inconsistency as well.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I understand that, but would you dispute the proposition that transgender status is a very broad category? Doesn't the American Psychological Society -- Association say it's an umbrella term?\n\nDefendant:\nI don't -- I don't know exactly what the American Psychological Association says, but I -- I don't dispute that there are people who fall within a transgender identity who may not fit into a binary identity.\n\nI still think that the distinguishing characteristic applies to every single transgender person, which is a birth sex that is inconsistent with their gender identity.\n\nAnd, of course, here, on SB1, this is a law that I think is easiest to understand in -- in the most straightforward classification on the basis of sex.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Sotomayor?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nCounsel, when asked whether you differed from the SG's position, I assume that if you win in this proceeding, what you're asking for us to reverse is the Sixth Circuit conclusion that rational basis review applied, correct?\n\nDefendant:\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nNow you think, as does the other side, that each of you should win on that question, but are you differing from the SG that that should be remanded to the court below to apply strict -- intermediate scrutiny in the first instance?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, Your Honor, we're not -- we're not disagreeing.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nNow, with respect to Justice Thomas's question, I'm not sure you answered it.\n\nYou did in part, and you said the relief you're seeking in the lawsuit, assuming you win on the intermediate standard review, is to permit your plaintiffs to receive the medication other children receive.\n\nI don't know if he was suggesting that one of the things we --we can go up in discrimination or we can go down, which is -- but I don't -- I don't think we've even decided who makes that choice, because the other alternative is to block the usage of all of these drugs for all children --\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- which would present a very different --an Arlington Heights, perhaps, question, but -- but the point is that what the relief is is still something that has to be determined as well.\n\nDefendant:\nWell, so if I could clarify, Your Honor, I don't think that the relief we're seeking is for our clients to receive the medication.\n\nThe relief we're seeking is for SB1 to stop being a barrier to their ability to continue to access medical care and make the individualized assessments with their doctors.\n\nSo it is just simply an injunction of the barrier to the medication that they had been receiving in Tennessee.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nGot it.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nTwo -- two basic questions.\n\nSo, whether we apply rational basis or intermediate scrutiny, either way, you end up looking at the State's justification, and they are articulating a health and safety justification, so it's not simply morals legislation, as they've described it.\n\nIt's health and safety justification.\n\nAnd it seems that there are risks and benefits both ways here.\n\nSo it's very hard to weigh those at least as the briefing has set out the -- the issues.\n\nIf the treatment's barred, some kids will suffer because they can't access the treatment.\n\nIf the treatment is allowed, these treatments are allowed, some kids will suffer who get the treatment and later wish they hadn't and want to detransition.\n\nAt least that's how I see the positions set out in the briefs.\n\nAnd so there are risks both ways...", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "902", "dialogue": "Judge: At this point, we've jumped over several preliminary questions. Before your time is up, could you say a little bit more about them? For one thing, do you think that the Respondent has a cause of action and, if so, where does it come from?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don't know where it comes from. The complaint seems to assume that there's probably a constitutional cause of action.\n\nJudge: Well, do they think it's an Ex parte Young cause of action?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s what is in—I mean, I think that’s their reasoning. The lower court has obviously countenanced that, and so it hasn't been previously explored in this case. We don't think that—they also assert an APA claim. We think that we have good arguments that the APA does not provide a cause of action here, that this is excepted from judicial review in two different rationales that are explained in decisions that we cite in the reply brief in different circuits. So I don't know where the cause of action is, unless it is an implicit Ex parte Young-like action that they're asking for declaratory judgment on.\n\nJudge: Well, I'll ask the other side about that. If there was a protected liberty interest in Mandel, wouldn't it follow that there's a protected liberty interest here? If the Respondent had not said, I want to live with my husband in the United States, but had said, he has a lot of interesting things to say, and I wish he were here so I could listen to what he has to say and therefore exercise my First Amendment right to receive information, would that be sufficient?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don't think so. I don't think that the marriage cases can be repleaded as First Amendment cases and satisfy Mandel. Again, I would say that Mandel didn't even say that there is a constitutional right there. And here, we think that the point of this is that we cite O'Bannon for the premise that in the due process context, an enforcement action taken against one person doesn't create a liberty interest in a third party who is indirectly affected by that.\n\nSo she is obviously affected by the decision that her husband can't come into the United States. The same thing would be true if this were a removal proceeding, removing him from the United States, and you wouldn't say she has a due process interest in intervening in that case and making arguments that he can't make or arguments that he can make. Either way, she doesn't have an independent due process interest there.\n\nJudge: You did ultimately provide a lot of information to the Respondent, and the lower court didn't fault that. It found that you gave plenty of information in the end. It just said it wasn't timely, and, therefore, it remanded to the district court to conduct further proceedings. I'm not clear what those are, what that would look like, and I'm just curious what you understand would follow on remand. And if there's a suggestion here perhaps that there's no harm, no foul because everybody knew exactly what was going on here—everybody knew, it appears, that the Respondent filed a petition for rehearing based on an assumption that the denial was due to gang membership, for example.\n\nSo there's a lot packed in there, but if you could help me with that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, I—I don’t think my opposing counsel would say that the lower court correctly concluded that we provided enough information. I don't read their brief as acknowledging that.\n\nJudge: Let's put that aside.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And I'm not sure what the lower court thinks is going to happen on remand. This is sort of terra incognita for the courts to say that giving that much information is enough, but, nevertheless, we want there to be a full-bore review.\n\nThe lower court seemed to suggest that there's going to be some type of independent judicial confirmation that the government was correct about its reasons. I think that goes far beyond anything that any other court has countenanced in the context of Mandel-type review. And so, at the end of the day, we don't think that the district court would be able to order the issuance of a visa.\n\nAnd the complaint doesn't ask for anything other than a declaration that the reason that had been given before we provided additional details about gang membership was not legitimate and bona fide.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Anything further?\n\nJudge: What exactly does the doctrine of consular nonreviewability do?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We think that it prevents a non-citizen outside the United States from challenging a decision to deny a visa and also prevents a third party from attacking that decision.\n\nTo the extent that there's an exception that the Court wants to acknowledge, that would then get into whether there is a constitutional liberty interest, and that's the first question here. But otherwise, it protects the political branch's ability to protect the nation's borders and decide who is going to be admitted to the United States without judicial oversight for cases involving foreign citizens who are outside the United States.\n\nJudge: So, without more, it is simply a doctrine that prevents all judicial review of these decisions?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. All judicial review that Congress has not provided for.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
