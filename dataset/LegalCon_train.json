{"id": "986", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff is suing the father of her grandchildren, claiming that he trashed the car that he borrowed. The defendant says this all has to do with a fight he had with the plaintiff’s daughter. It’s the case of \"Stop Riding Me So Hard.\" Thank you, Douglas. Wendy Graves, hi. You are suing Vincent Brown, the father of your grandchildren, for $1,427.36 that you feel he owes you in order to repair a car that you had loaned to him and he returned in poor condition. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: In October of last year, Vincent came to me and asked if he could use my second car, which is the Honda Civic.\n\nJudge: How long had he been with your daughter?\n\nPlaintiff: Over 12 years.\n\nJudge: And they have how many children?\n\nPlaintiff: Two.\n\nJudge: Okay, how old are the children?\n\nPlaintiff: 10 and four.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, you had been incarcerated, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: For how long?\n\nPlaintiff: Almost two years, 18 months.\n\nJudge: What were the charges?\n\nPlaintiff: Just say it. Gas stealing.\n\nJudge: What?\n\nPlaintiff: Stealing fuel.\n\nJudge: You don’t get two years for stealing fuel.\n\nPlaintiff: You get more than that, to be honest. And also, we had our own little issues—domestic, drugs.\n\nJudge: Okay. Federal charge. I knew it was a little more than gas. Okay, come on up. Did you guys break up when he went in?\n\nPlaintiff’s Daughter: We broke up the day he went in.\n\nJudge: Okay. But he’s coming out. Are you renewing?\n\nPlaintiff’s Daughter: No.\n\nJudge: No. You just wanted to help him out because he could then get a job. And if he gets a job, what?\n\nPlaintiff: Then he wouldn’t have to ask me for a ride back and forth.\n\nJudge: And because he could just say no to that. But then he could pay child support, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. So my daughter asked me if I would lend the car to him, and in turn, I would get some fees for that.\n\nJudge: Right. A little money. Because he was going to pay how much for the car?\n\nPlaintiff: The first couple of weeks, he was paying like $65. I was only expecting $60.\n\nJudge: All right, and then he started paying $60, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you actually put this in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I love that. And why did you put it in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I watch you.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.\n\nPlaintiff: Because I watch you all the time.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.\n\nPlaintiff: Because I love you.\n\nJudge: Let me see the contract. I’m sure you watch me too, right?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Listen to me, I am huge in prison. Go ahead. \"Vincent Brown will be using a Honda LS Civic 2002 belonging to Wendy Graves and will be responsible for any incident concerning the vehicle while in my care. That includes tickets, towing, breakdowns…\"\nJudge: Mr. Smith, you claim that the defendant returned your car in a damaged condition beyond normal wear and tear. Can you specify the issues?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. When I lent the car to Mr. Johnson, it was in perfect condition. But when he returned it, the brakes were worn out, and the engine was making a strange noise.\n\nJudge: Mr. Johnson, how do you respond to these claims?\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I only used the car for regular commuting, nothing extreme. I didn’t cause any damage beyond what happens naturally with use.\n\nJudge: Mr. Smith, do you have any maintenance records proving the car was in excellent condition before lending it out?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have records from right before I lent it, but it was working fine.\n\nJudge: Do you have any expert testimony or mechanic reports stating the damage was due to misuse rather than normal wear and tear?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but—\n\nJudge: Without concrete evidence proving the defendant misused the car, I cannot rule in your favor. Wear and tear happen naturally. My ruling is in favor of the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Emotional appeal, persuasion, exaggeration"}

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff is a professional walker who says that he was badly injured because the defendant's sidewalk wasn’t level. Now, the defendant says the guy just tripped. It’s the case of “You're Not on the Level.” Thank you.\n\nJudge: Douglas, okay. Jonathan Mone, you are suing Maxwell Tow for $2,000 in pain and suffering plus punitive damages because, according to you, you tripped over a sidewalk that was his responsibility to maintain. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Now, on May 16, like every other day, I go for a brisk walk next to his, uh, in front of his house.\n\nJudge: According to your complaint, you've been walking for 35 years, 10 to 15 miles a day?\n\nPlaintiff: More, sometimes more. Really, when I started, the maximum I did was 38 miles a day.\n\nJudge: How long does it take you to walk that?\n\nPlaintiff: ‘Cause I'm a power walker. That’s what I do. Four and a half to four and a quarter miles per hour. Walk very fast.\n\nJudge: Okay, all right. So anyway, you're walking in front of where he lives—his house. The sidewalk was clear?\n\nPlaintiff: Everything is flat and flush and fluid. Very nice. I got to his house, I tripped so bad on my right leg. I fell on my right knee, I fell on my face, and I was stunned by the surprise. I was bleeding from my face.\n\nPlaintiff: So as I got up, he, the defendant, came out of the house to see what—\n\nJudge: What, were you yelling or anything? How did you know something was going on outside?\n\nDefendant: I didn't. What I did is, I opened the door to retrieve my newspaper.\n\nJudge: Okay, so it was a coincidence.\n\nDefendant: And just by coincidence, he was standing there when I went to get the paper.\n\nJudge: Okay. And did you see that he was hurt?\n\nDefendant: I saw he was standing there looking sort of dazed, and he seemed to have blood on his shirt and a little blood on his head. But I didn’t see him fall. I came out—\n\nJudge: Right. And so did you say to him, “Oh, what happened?” Like, were you trying to help him? What happened while you were out there?\n\nDefendant: No, I went up to him to see what had happened, and we chatted a couple of minutes. And then he started yelling, “I’m going to sue! I’m going to sue!”\n\nDefendant: Ah. So then I turned around, and I went back in the house.\n\nJudge: Okay. Okay. Meanwhile, were you there?\n\nWitness: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what do you know about this?\n\nWitness: Oh, he fell, and he called—\n\nJudge: You didn’t see it happen though either, right?\n\nWitness: No, I saw him sitting on the ground.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nWitness: And he called the police and an ambulance. And when the police and the ambulance came, they came out, I went out, and they said, “Oh, you again?”\n\nJudge: “Oh, you again?” And there’s no lifting of the sidewalk?\n\nJudge: Well, let’s see. Do you folks have pictures of the sidewalk?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJudge: Let me see your pictures of the sidewalk.\n\nDefendant: You want to make a correction?\n\nJudge: Yeah. First, I want to see a picture. Picture of the—is this a picture of the sidewalk?\n\nPlaintiff: That—that’s the rise.\n\nJudge: Yes, that’s the rise.\n\nPlaintiff: There’s a little cement there where we filled it in.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but that’s kind of lifted. That’s pretty lifted right there. Is that the tree root?\n\nDefendant: That’s—\n\nJudge: Are you kidding me? You guys know it’s lifted. And you know that New York law, like many, many, many communities, requires you to fix the city sidewalks in front of your own home. You know that’s the law, right?\n\nDefendant: We do.\n\nJudge: Because you took a little cement and slapped it there and—\n\nJudge: Um, how many inches is that?\n\nDefendant: Two inches.\n\nJudge: Two inches high? Guys, that’s not okay. I know it’s more expensive to hire somebody with a jackhammer to jackhammer that, jackhammer the root, and lay it down. I know ‘cause I’ve had to do it.\n\nJudge: But two inches is not okay. And the city has never told you guys, “Hey, you have to fix that”?\n\nDefendant: They should really be on top of that.\n\nJudge: Wow. Two inches.\n\nJudge: Now, the ambulance came, and you did not go in the ambulance, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: According to the report, you refused medical attention, but that really means you say to them, “I’m not going with you, I’m not going to the hospital.” So when did you—did you go to any doctor?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I—I don’t know, I don’t need another—because if I go, I get a bunch of X-rays. With my disease, lymphoma, I don’t need it.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what—tell me about your injuries. You’re suing for $2,000. Tell me about your injuries.\n\n[Conversation continues as the judge deliberates, discusses injuries, and delivers a final verdict awarding $500 to the plaintiff.]\n\nJudge: I am going to find in your favor and in the amount of $500.

{"id": "546", "dialogue": "Judge:\nDouglas Latoya Frasier, yes? You are suing your former friend, Canel Alberino, yes, for $74 in loans, a parking ticket, and clothing items that you say throughout the course of your friendship she was supposed to repay for and hasn't? What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nI've known the defendant since about third grade. We've been best friends, inseparable for a long time. About 2008 or 2009, we were both unemployed, going through financial issues. Hers were a bit more dire than mine because she had her apartment, her car. Me, I was taken care of by my daughter's father, so I didn’t really want for anything. I had an account with Wachovia years ago when I was working downtown and they closed my account due to an overdraft fee that they say I owe, but they waited a month and a half to cash a check that I had given them a while ago to cash for rent. But they waited until multiple things hit the account so the account would go over, and I disputed it. I paid it, but it took like a year and a half for the bank to recognize that I paid the red flag fee for, they say, for me to be able to open my own account.\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nI had gotten my money for school. Are you trying to explain to me why you took money and put it in her account? Yes, okay. You didn’t have creditors chasing you in a judgment against you or the tax man looking for you?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, it was just the, I had an account that was closed. Due to that bank thing, I asked her, since I had gotten my school loan, 'cause she put the money in her account since I couldn’t open my own. I gave her $790 to put in the account, and it was just left in the account. She ran into some complications where she wasn’t able to pay all of her rent and I think a car note. And she had stated that she had got a notice on her door letting her know that she had to pay the rent by a certain date. I said, she called me, and we usually spoke on the phone every day. She let me know the issue, and I told her, \"Well, there’s money in your account, I’m not using it right now. It’s not a dire need for me to have it right now, so it’s not anything for me to loan it to you right now.\" She was like, “Are you sure?” I was like, \"Whatever you want to do with it, however you want to do it, do what you need to do. Let me know afterwards what you spent, and when you get back on your feet, that’s when you’ll pay me back. I’m not going to...\"\n\nJudge:\nHow much did she take, according to you?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nShe said that she took $550. That was to pay off whatever she needed to pay. I don’t know if it was for just rent or if it was for both rent and car. I'm not sure.\n\nJudge:\nAt some point, you guys get into a rocky patch there, and you end up parting your friendship. Why was that?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nWe went to South Beach with a group of girls, our friends, we all went to South Beach. That summer in South Beach, me and her had a falling out over an ordeal with her and her sister that I didn’t primarily agree with. She thought that I should be on her side and be mad at her sister as well, but I’m not a person of that nature.\n\nJudge:\nBut you’ve been friends since third grade. A disagreement on vacation in South Beach one time...?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nIt was just other events leading up to that. That was probably the breaking point at South Point, I should say. South Beach was the kicker in, I guess, both of our lives for us to part with.\n\nJudge:\nSo you're also suing her for a jacket and some shoes. What is that about?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe jacket, trivial. Shoes as well, but principal behind it. I had stuff at her house. Me and her go shopping at Mandy’s every now and again. We’ll have stuff at her house. I had stuff that I wanted to take back, but I didn’t take it back at that point in time. In that time frame, we had a really big flood. It rained really bad and it flooded in front of her building.\n\nJudge:\nWait a second, when was this in relation to when you stopped talking to each other?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThis was prior to us stopping speaking.\n\nJudge:\nI understand that. I want to know how long prior to it.\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe jacket was probably about six months.\n\nJudge:\nWhat about the shoes?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe shoes, they’re $9 shoes. Are they a whole shoe?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, okay. It was a shoe that I got. The shoes were left at her house because they were too big for me. I was going to go to the store and get store credit. I got them on sale. She wore them and was like, \"They’re my size.\" You didn’t need them. They were only $9. I’m like, \"It’s the principle behind it.\" If you leave something at my house...\n\nJudge:\nYeah, but you stayed friends after that?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, we didn’t stay friends after that.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t stop being friends over the $9 pair of shoes?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, we didn’t stop being friends over the $9. It was well after the $9 pair of shoes.\n\nJudge:\nIt was in the midst of us...\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nIt’s just now that you’re suing, you’re going to bring up every little thing that happened between you?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, it’s not every little thing that happened between us. This was in the... Tell me about the parking ticket.\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe parking ticket was for her school. We went to her school. She had some business to take care of. We were both upstairs while she was talking to her advisor. Okay, I go downstairs. The guy had already did the ticket. He said he couldn’t give it back.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThat happened in the summer. I'm not quite sure when.\n\nJudge:\nWhat summer?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nSummer of 2008.\n\nJudge:\nThese ladies knew each other since third grade. Now they’re locked in the most trivial legal battle. The plaintiff is suing over a $9 pair of shoes, in addition to other stuff. There’s got to be more to this. Let’s listen. What’s going on?\n\nJudge:\nShe says that you, she had money in your account, you knew it was her money, you used it when you needed it and then you never repaid it. What’s going on?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nThe plaintiff has actually never told me that I had to pay her her money back. And I never used what she’s claiming. It went from $550 to $700 now, which I have a text message to prove it. At the time, it was not about my apartment, it was not about my car note. It was strictly about school and a cable bill. I said to her, \"Listen, my cable is going to be cut off.\" I did not ask her for the money, I was telling her the situation. She offered and said, \"Oh, you know what, don’t worry about it. You’re my best friend, I’ll give you the money.\" I said, \"Well, I don’t have it now to give back to you.\" She said, \"Do not worry about it. I’m making $45,000 a year now, I don’t need the money back.\"\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nSo I said fine, no, that’s exactly what she said. That’s exactly the way she said it. \"I do not need it back now.\" I went to my uncle and he gave me tuition money to get back in school, which he actually wrote a statement about. He gave me $310. The $238 that I used, I said to her when she brought this up after we were no longer friends for almost a year. She brought it up and I said, “Well, listen, did you use $550 or $238?”\n\nJudge:\nHow do you remember?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nBecause it was a cable bill. I know exactly when it was going to get cut off because that was the only time it was a backed-up bill for two months and I said to her, \"You know what? I’ll just use that, and that’s it.\" You have a statement from your uncle?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nIs there a text between you two back in the day, four years ago, that tells me that... that’ll shed some light on whether it was $550 or...?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nI have a text message from her. Us, March of what year?\n\nJudge:\nThis year?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nSaying how does it say how much money?\n\nJudge:\nNo, not saying how much the money is, but that she was going to work out a payment plan with me for the $250.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nYou never said it was... I tell you $250 and she rounded it off to $300. We had a phone conversation, and after that, I sent her a text message. And I said, \"We could talk about the $250.\" She texted me back and said, \"It’s funny how now you’re saying $300 when you owe me $550, but she sued me today for $700.\"\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nSo I said to her, “I don’t owe you that much. I only used the money for my payment on a cable bill.\" She never had mentioned this to me before last year.\n\nJudge:\nWhy should she pay your cable bill or your parking ticket? In other words, why would she...?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nShe didn’t pay. She didn’t pay a parking ticket either. She did not pay a parking ticket.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any evidence that you paid a parking ticket?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nEverything was taken out of that account for... Her Jesus, CH. Do you have any evidence at all, like an email or...?\n\nJudge:\nShow me the text that you have. I’m sure it’s not going to say anything about the parking ticket.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nHere’s a text message. Is the person next to you moral support or...?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nMoral support. My grandmother has nothing to do with the case.\n\nJudge:\nLord have mercy. You answer.\n\nJudge:\nThe funny thing is I just told someone I would send you monthly payments of the money you loaned me that I allegedly borrowed or stole, so you say. And their response was, “Watch, she’ll try to take you to court like she did her own blood.” I laughed and said, “Probably, Latoya. I don’t know what you are going through financially that would make you bring this bullcrap up, but at this point I could care less. You of all people should know I don’t get scared by threat. You have become such a low life with your mentality that it’s a shame. This and all the other reasons are why I would never be your friend again. Please don’t talk slick to me anymore. Let’s be women or nothing.”\n\nJudge:\nThese are not helpful.\n\nJudge:\nI have one question before me, and the one question before me is: Is this a loan or is this a gift, and how much is this? It would be really helpful if I had bank statements from back then. Does anybody have bank statements?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nThe account was closed. And because this was short notice, because she sent the sum to my...\n\nJudge:\nIt would be really helpful if I had emails back and forth between you guys or texts back and forth from back then, not now when everybody’s playing Guinness’s Macho, but from back then.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nIs that going to prove anything, though?\n\nJudge:\nIf there was a loan, there would have been an agreement on that.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": ", gaslighting, playing the victim, emotional appeal, minimization persuasion"}

You've asked us not to mention the company name, for $7,792.91 for a vet bill and your travel expenses to and from the vet.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe hired her to groom the dogs.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nEverything was fine at the beginning. Professional at first. The dog—her clippers, I guess, were not good for the hair. She had to bathe the dog, come back to dry the dog, use the clippers again, and in between that time, she sliced my dog right where her leg is.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, were you there?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was there.\n\nJudge:\nIs this a mobile kind of unit?\n\nDefendant:\nI provide an in-home dog grooming service. I just bring all my kits, my professional clippers, and all of that to people’s homes. We usually specialize in difficult dogs and, you know, elderly dogs especially.\n\nJudge:\nSo you do it in their bathtub? Where do you do it?\n\nDefendant:\nAnywhere in a room—any surface that we can put the dog on safely so they won’t get injured, depending on the size of the dog.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how did this happen? How did the dog get cut?\n\nDefendant:\nFrankly, I actually don’t know. From my years of being a vet tech, it looked like a skin tag got removed, and I specifically asked—\n\nJudge:\nHow many years were you a vet tech?\n\nDefendant:\nAbout two.\n\nJudge:\nSo when you say it had to have been a skin tag, wouldn’t you have felt a skin tag?\n\nDefendant:\nNot always.\n\nJudge:\nA lot of times, if they’re tiny, then they’re also not going to require 10 stitches, right?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe dog got 10 stitches.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you brought the dog over to the vet?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd so everybody realizes that it happened when it happened, right? Did the dog scream?\n\nPlaintiff:\nShe did.\n\nJudge:\nAnd was there blood?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThere was a little bit, yes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what is being said at the home when that happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, I feel like I handled it very well. You know, I told her—she said it never happened to her before. And, you know, accidents do happen. I’m not discrediting her at all with her work, but accidents do happen, and that’s what happened in this case.\n\nAnd she said that she would pay for the cost of the bill when we got it, that she would pay it in increments.\n\nI even said it’s fine if you pay it in increments.\n\nAnd when I told her the amount of the bill, she said that she was not going to pay the blood work at all because that wasn’t necessary.\n\nAnd I have a letter from the hospital saying that the blood work was necessary to put the dog under anesthesia before a procedure.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd I don’t feel that it’s fair at all that I come out of pocket for something that wasn’t my fault.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would she come out of pocket?\n\nSo, if the dog gets hurt on the grooming table, but the dog’s really aggressive and emotional, is the groomer responsible for vet bills?\n\nAudience Member:\nMaybe if they don’t have the proper equipment to restrain the dog.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you say?\n\nAudience Member:\nI think that’s on the owner.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nAudience Member:\nBecause they own the dog, and it’s incumbent upon them to inform the groomer of any emotional needs that the dog might have.\n\nJudge:\nFair enough. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nI actually don’t feel like she should have come out of pocket for the entire thing.\n\nDefendant:\nAbsolutely not.\n\nJudge:\nWhy should she come out of pocket at all?\n\nAccording to you, she asked you to ask the vet what was the reason, and, you know, the vet wouldn’t get involved in giving paperwork, which is understandable.\n\nIt’s not the vet's job to be giving paperwork.\n\nBut go ahead.\n\nDefendant:\nThe vet didn’t provide me that letter.\n\nJudge:\nBut what did the vet tell you?\n\nDefendant:\nThat the cut was way too big to have been a skin tag.\n\nJudge:\nIn fact, it was more sarcastic than that. What was it exactly that the vet said?\n\nDefendant:\nThat it was big enough that it looked like a dinner plate. If it was a skin tag, it had to be a skin tag the size of a dinner plate.\n\nJudge:\nBut really, let's start from the premise that if that's your defense, then you’ve got to prove it.\n\nYou also have to prove to me that if it were a skin tag, that wouldn’t be your fault too.\n\nSo, I don’t get it.

{"id": "1014", "dialogue": "\n\n**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Raymond Lamb. He says the defendant rear-ended him on a major highway and paid for his car to be fixed. The repair took 10 days. He’s an Uber driver who lost out on work. The defendant had promised to reimburse him for his lost work but hasn’t. So here they are. He’s suing for $3,833, the amount he’s owed.\n\nThis is the defendant, Julio Vieira. He says the plaintiff told him he makes $180 a day and he agreed to pay for 7 days of his missed work. Then he gets sued for 10 days at almost $400 a day and he refuses to be ripped off by this scammer, so he’s not paying. He’s accused of rear-ending a guy. All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant rear-ended him on the highway. His car was in the shop for days, and he’s an Uber driver. The defendant says the plaintiff is trying to rip him off. It’s the case of \"This Accident Was Uber Expensive.\"\n\n**Judge:** Raymond Lamb, you are suing Julio Vieira for $3,833 that you say he owes you for a car crash. Tell me what happened during that crash.\n\n**Plaintiff:** On August 29th, I was driving my wife to work in Yonkers on the Major Deegan. I was in the left lane and driving when I realized the car in front of me had slowed down dramatically, so I had to slow down dramatically. When I slowed down, that’s when Mr. Vieira—he did not slow down fast enough—and he skidded and rear-ended my car.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, and how much damage did it do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, according to the auto repair place, it was about $5,000—a little less than $5,000.\n\n**Judge:** Is this your car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Wow. Okay. And then, did you hit the car in front of you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, but if I didn’t slow down, I would have.\n\n**Judge:** Am I not seeing damage to the front of this, or is that his car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, that’s his.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, wow. Alright. What happened?\n\n**Defendant:** I was actually driving. As I’m driving and everything, the only thing I saw was a sudden stop from his car. I skidded like three car lengths. There was no way for me to go on the right side because if I went to the right side—\n\n**Judge:** Right side’s a barrier?\n\n**Defendant:** No, the right side is not a barrier. We pulled over to the right. We were all the way on the left side. If I went to the right side, I would’ve actually hit the car that was coming, and I would’ve created a chain reaction of cars hitting cars. So I had no choice but to stop.\n\n**Judge:** Right. But, you know, the philosophy is that you’re supposed to be traveling at a safe enough speed where you can stop and not hit like he did. So, you ended up hitting him?\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah.\n\n**Judge:** And so, you ended up taking responsibility for the accident—at least in the beginning?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I did.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And so, you guys negotiate—and I know because I read months of texts between the two of you—and you negotiate that… What do you do for a living?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I’m an Uber and Lyft driver.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Which do you like better, Uber or Lyft?\n\n**Plaintiff:** They’re very similar. It’s just about the same, but I end up making more with Uber.\n\n**Judge:** It’s about the same?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Lyft has better bonus incentives, but Uber gives you more business.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, that’s pretty much what I figured. Oh, by the way, the shop that you took it to—how did you find that shop?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh, it was a shop that Mr. Vieira had said he has done some electrical work for and that they owed him back pay of $14,000.\n\n**Judge:** Is that accurate?\n\n**Defendant:** It’s accurate.\n\n**Judge:** And so, they hadn’t paid you your fees?\n\n**Defendant:** No, I haven’t gotten paid yet because I’m not even done yet with the electrical work.\n\n**Judge:** Oh. But were they going to barter the repair with you?\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah.\n\n**Judge:** Well, they just took it off of whatever they were going to owe you?\n\n**Defendant:** Okay.\n\n**Judge:** So when he did the repair, it took how many days?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Ten.\n\n**Judge:** Ten days. Alright. And somebody paid for the repair—you didn’t have to pay it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** How did that happen? Who paid for the repair?\n\n**Defendant:** Well, they actually deducted from the money that they owe me.\n\n**Judge:** So you didn’t shell out the repair money?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So now, you had said to him at the very beginning, \"Who’s going to pay my lost wages?\" Because you folks were pondering going through insurance, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And then what made you make the decision not to go through insurance?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, Mr. Vieira didn’t want his insurance premiums to jump up dramatically. So, you know, he seemed like a really nice guy, so we decided—either way, the car was going to get fixed, either through insurance or by him. So, through good faith, we figured… and because of the agreement that he would pay the amount per day that I didn’t work, we decided to go through his auto repair.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And one of the things he said to you in a text was, \"If you go through my insurance, they may not pay your lost wages.\"\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Did you ever try going through his insurance?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, we did not.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So you folks agreed, did you not, that you were going to pay the lost wages?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** What was it you agreed to?\n\n**Defendant:** It was $180, if I’m not mistaken, a day.\n\n**Judge:** A day? For how many days?\n\n**Defendant:** I think 10 days.\n\n**Judge:** Then why didn’t you pay?\n\n**Defendant:** I had to take care of the car first.\n\n**Judge:** That already happened. The car was taken care of. So now what I need to see is your proof of lost wages.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have my statements from Uber and Lyft.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. I’m ruling in your favor. Verdict for the plaintiff. You should have paid the $180 or worked something out. $2,520 to the plaintiff.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection,playing the victim"}
{"id": "178", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Juan Lopez, yes, you are suing Henry Dorsey the third—or the second—the third, okay. Yes, indeed, the third, for $1,100, the cost of a car that you say you sold to him and let him have without paying you anything. Anything?\nPlaintiff: Correct.\nJudge: What happened?\nPlaintiff: Just a little story about I met Mr. Dorsey about two years ago. He was a good personal friend of mine and, um, seems like our whole friendship now that I look back, it's one of those friendships that I was always helping him out. I got him a job at the company I worked for. I helped him out financially numerous times.\nJudge: You got him a job with your firm?\nPlaintiff: I got him a job with the company I work for.\nJudge: The company you work for?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nPlaintiff: April 18, he got let go from the company. April 22nd, he was supposed to pay me the car.\nJudge: So you sell him a car. What kind of car is this?\nPlaintiff: I sold him a 1998 Buick Sabre with 159,000 miles.\nJudge: For how much?\nPlaintiff: For $1,100.\nJudge: Did he pay you anything?\nPlaintiff: He paid me $100 of that.\nJudge: Did he pay you anything more than the $100?\nPlaintiff: No ma’am.\nJudge: Now, according to you, you paid more than the $100?\nDefendant: Yes, that's how I got the title and stuff.\nJudge: You gave him the title without him finishing paying?\nPlaintiff: I gave him the title with a written contract saying that he would have to pay me.\nJudge: But most people, like, wait until they're paid to transfer the title. You didn’t do even that much?\nPlaintiff: No, I made a mistake.\nJudge: So now, according to you, it's $100 and according to you, it's $450. Fascinating.\nPlaintiff: And then what happened?\nPlaintiff: Basically, he got let go, so the agreement was I sold a car to him on 3/22/12.\nJudge: Okay, let me see the paperwork from the sale.\nPlaintiff: If you notice, the first line, he started signing and he missed. He was mistakes or he signed underneath, so my signature is on the first line.\nJudge: This car is sold as is, with the only guarantee being state inspection. I have 30 days to make any mechanical corrections if it does not pass state inspection.\nPlaintiff: Oh my God, that’s not really as is. As is is just as is.\nPlaintiff: Why would you guarantee to do that?\nPlaintiff: Because I figured, you know, I never thought we were going to have these problems, so I wanted to do the right thing to just...\nJudge: You don’t think much?\nPlaintiff: Not really. I’m not in the used car business.\nJudge: Then don’t do it. Why are you doing this?\nPlaintiff: Is this a car that you had?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nDefendant: And apparently it didn’t pass inspection.\nPlaintiff: It failed inspection for... I believe it was for a gas cap.\nDefendant: No, it’s more than a gas cap.\nJudge: I mean, I’m not... I don’t have to pay. Do you have the inspection?\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t.\nDefendant: Man. Did he call you and tell you when it failed inspection?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, we were still working together when it failed, and we were still working together at that time.\nJudge: And so what did he tell you was the reason it failed? Didn’t he show you the paperwork?\nDefendant: He failed, told me it failed inspection for OBD2 readiness, which means that at the time when he went to inspection, all the computer systems weren’t communicating with each other and it had a bad gas cap.\nPlaintiff: According to you, it failed inspection.\nDefendant: Why?\nDefendant: Because he erased the codes with the little computer they use to read all the stuff, and the New Jersey inspection computer wasn’t picking up those codes for the...\nJudge: Do you have proof of what you just said?\nDefendant: Because when I look at the failed inspection for 4/12, it doesn’t say what you just said. All it says is gas cap and one other thing—something having to do with the exhaust.\nDefendant: No, this is what the man that does all the printout at the computer, they call you over to let you know exactly what's wrong with the vehicle.\nJudge: Do you have that in writing?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: It says it here, though. Maybe you have something different than what you submitted. Let me see what you have for April, because you took it for inspection in April and then you get fired April 22nd.\nDefendant: It was 18. The guy had radio reception... No one cares about that radio static. Increased interference with rear window defogger. Rear window defogger grids may be inoperative. Transmission oil leaking from transmission vent. No reverse. Second gear.\nJudge: What year is this car?\nPlaintiff: 98.\nJudge: Why would you like put a warranty on a 1998 car that you'll get it to pass inspection?\nPlaintiff: Because when I looked at it, it was emissions-related, and I’m... you know, I’m well...\nJudge: Look at all the stuff, though. Do you understand the problem?\nPlaintiff: I'm mechanically inclined, so I figured out, you know, I never thought it was going to escalate.\nJudge: Mechanically inclined. I have 30 days to make any mechanical corrections if it does not pass state inspection. I have text messages that I printed out from all the times that I texted Mr. Dorsey regarding what, you know, what we should do to fix this car. And I went to his house on May 7th when the agreement was we had... He was supposed to bring the car to me on May 7th. I texted him. He never got back to me. So I showed up at his house.\nJudge: Do you have any text from him?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it's right there. Text from him. Yeah. Everything copies for me and him. I have notes on the date. See the actual text as opposed to what you typed out on a piece of paper.\nJudge: If you look at the last text message, it goes... It's the last one that’s on that piece of paper.\nPlaintiff: So if you’re making a deal with a really good friend, would you ask for receipts?\nDefendant: I personally would not. But the fact of the matter is I have been screwed over numerous times when it comes to money, so it is what it is.\nJudge: I just love your honesty. I think it’s personally important to keep the fundamentals of the relationship intact. That you have the receipt because it protects both the parties at all times.\nJudge: That’s funny.\nDefendant: That’s funny.\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom, did you ever give him back the car in order to give him a chance to make any repairs?\nPlaintiff: We were supposed to meet after work. I leave the keys with them. I would leave.\nJudge: So did you do that?\nPlaintiff: I left the keys with him. I even tried to meet him. I have text messages here where I tried to meet him on the weekend. He said he couldn't do it because he locked the shop keys in a truck.\nJudge: But I see text after text after text from him calling you, him saying, “Call me, call me, call me ASAP.” The 22nd, the 25th, the 30th. “Call me ASAP.” Finally, on the first Monday, no excuses, I have been way too nice about this. You knew how important this was to bring me the car. I did my part. Now it’s up to you. Monday, not one day more. These are his texts to you, correct?\nPlaintiff: But I was talking to him on the telephone. You're not seeing that part, though.\nJudge: No, of course I’m not. That’s what I’m saying. It looks like he’s chasing you down. Why didn’t you just answer?\nPlaintiff: I would have called him, though.\nJudge: Why would I answer him? I got the cell phone number, and you don’t even bring it to a repair to get estimates for the repair until June.\nJudge: Why hadn't you gone to find out? See, here’s the problem. If I see you not taking the car to him, which that’s how the text looks like you’re avoiding him so he can repair it, and I see you not taking it to anybody else to repair it until a month and a half later, it looks like maybe you just don’t feel like paying for the rest of this car.\nJudge: You have one estimate from a third-party repair shop for $2,262.\nJudge: What evidence do you have of which of these items are in order to get it to pass inspection? In other words, what somebody will get me is a repair estimate from a place that says these are the six things that it has to do to pass inspection. Yours doesn’t say that. Because I’m sure you tell these people to just tell you everything that needs doing on the car, but your warranty isn’t for everything that needs doing. Your warranty is for what it needs to pass inspection.\nJudge: How am I to look at this and figure out what here is to pass inspection and what is just you improving on the car?\nDefendant: But I’m not improving the exhaust.\nJudge: A brand new AC compressor? Where is that on the failed inspection?\nDefendant: The AC compressor?\nDefendant: Yeah, that was an agreement he made with me, though. That’s just mechanic stuff that’s wrong with the car, correct? Some of that stuff is not for...\nJudge: So you admit that the AC compressor has nothing to do with it?\nDefendant: Yes, I know that.\nJudge: Alright, here’s how we’re going to resolve this. Number one, I find that the defendant can only prove—and it’s really by virtue of the plaintiff’s admission—that he paid $100 for this car. He has no evidence that he paid more than $100, the $450 as he says he paid, because he has no receipt for that.\nJudge: Number two, I find that the repair estimate, which was obtained two months after the sale and once everything hits the fan between you guys, is a little bit suspicious. But from looking at it, there are certain things that I can do my best to correlate. Because you did not bring me something that says this is what it’s going to take to pass inspection, which other litigants in your position have done.\nJudge: I can only do my best to attempt to correlate that to the failed inspection of April 12th. But the failed inspection, remember, is for not being able to read codes as well as the things that it does list in there.\nJudge: But looking at the repair estimate and looking at the money that’s owed, I’m going to do a little rough justice.\nJudge: I’m going to allow the defendant, because of your warranty that you should never have given on a 1998 car, a $300 allowance to make repairs in order to pass inspection.\nJudge: I’m going to order him therefore to pay you the rest of the money that I find that he owes you, which is a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $700.

It's the case of Cops and Rockers. Thank you Douglas.\nJudge: Okay Jared DiBerto, you are suing Stephanie Devau and Jeremiah Williams who is your son. You look 15.

He just needs a proper evaluation and a right doctor to look at him.\nJudge: All right. Um you're suing them for $500, them for $500 the amount of your insurance deductible for repairs to your car for damages that you say were caused by her child. Tell me what's going on.\nPlaintiff: Uh on August 8th I reported to work, uh parked my car in our employee lot and went to work. A short time later, uh one of our-\nJudge: Where do you work?\nPlaintiff: Uh I work for a local police department.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: As a dispatcher. I was informed uh few hours into the shift by one of the other officers that kids were seeing throwing rocks over the adjacent fence and some cars had been struck. I went out to inspect my vehicle make sure it wasn't damaged. Unfortunately it was, there was a large scratch, dent marks on the roof of my car um and an investigation was done. The department declined to press charges they decided to just let the parents handle the disciplinary but-\nJudge: How they figure out who did it?\nPlaintiff: Uh officers did an investigation they-\nJudge: Okay but you got- you're- you have a civil suit pending here so you now have to prove it to me. You can't just tell me somebody else is convinced. You have to tell me how they figured out he did it.\nPlaintiff: Okay uh I was informed by the officers who the individuals were who admitted to doing it and statements were filed by the defendant.\nJudge: Oh okay can I have the statement?\nDefendant: Yes ma'am. What happened- my son went outside to play with the neighborhood kids as they always do in the driveway and um my neighbor that lives directly below us, it's a four family apartment, their kids were also outside playing and they always play in our driveway. We can see them from our kitchen window so if they were to take off for two seconds we could call their name they come right back.\nJudge: The fence no- the fence that divid- if you're looking though-\nDefendant: You turn around and do something no-\nJudge: The fence that divides my driveway divides their Drive-\nDefendant: Between you and the police department right.\nJudge: So it's one fence?\nDefendant: Uhhuh.\nJudge: Right and there's trees so it's not like you could see what's on the other side?\nDefendant: Okay but apparently all the kids were throwing rocks over the fence including your kid.\nDefendant: That's what they said no-\nJudge: I'm asking you what your kid said.\nDefendant: My son said he didn't do it. He said that the other kids were throwing the rocks and he ran around the fence to see what had happened with one of the other boys. That's what he said he said he wasn't throwing the Rocks.\nJudge: Do you believe him?\nDefendant: I don't know what to believe.\nJudge: What- how do you resolve that little thing like if I- if I think my kid is lying to me which you may think your child is you're not sure-\nDefendant: I can't rest until it's solved till the mystery is no longer a mystery.\nJudge: He's been questioned several times because there was followup investigations and did he say he did it?\nDefendant: No he's still saying he didn't.\nJudge: He say to the police he just told me that he admitted doing it is that not true?\nDefendant: No I didn't your honor if I may-\nPlaintiff: He didn't admit to doing it and I didn't say he did it. There's no signed statement whatever is in that statement is what another officer claims I said.\nJudge: Um no no these are be statement signed by you guys hold on what is this piece of paper?\nPlaintiff: That was part of an investigation that was began by my Police Department due to an allegation of the defendant.\nJudge: Tell me about that.\nPlaintiff: Uh I was uh working with the defendant she did tell me she wanted to pay for the damages over the phone unfortunately I have no proof of that but we did have conversation-\nJudge: I don't think she denies that.\nDefendant: No he called me literally the next day saying that the officer the investigating officer said if I didn't pay the whole thing in one um sum that my son was going to get arrested for a felony charge but he was looking for all of it from me and I was like- and I told him that the other two children however only one of them is listed that were involved is not my child so I should not be held responsible for somebody else's child's actions and that's when I went to the police station and I said look there's text being sent back and forth he's asking if I have renters insurance he's asking questions I'm not trying to continue going with this back and forth game and I knew that there some things weren't adding up and I launched an informal internal um investigation.\nJudge: Against him?\nDefendant: Yep because- because of the harassment.\nJudge: Okay this was the next day after the event?\nDefendant: Yeah then-\nJudge: And the harassment would be telling you if you don't pay the whole thing your son will be arrested for a felony which is of course bogus right? Did you ever say that to her?\nPlaintiff: No the officers reported to me uh actually I'm sorry I did about the felony because it was reporting not a felony-\nJudge: 9-year-old-\nPlaintiff: They're not going to file charges-\nJudge: I understand but the officers-\nPlaintiff: Okay so that's kind of like nasty I understand the officers who were investigating told me that it was a felony of criminal mischief because of the total value that's what I was told. It's my fault for repeating that however once an investigation was started I- I was not allowed to have contact with her I couldn't talk to her anymore.\nJudge: What ended up happening with the investigation like what they do to get in trouble?\nPlaintiff: I was given a- rather than being suspended and possibly terminated they decided to give me a written reprimand that goes into my file.\nJudge: Okay what part didn't they like?\nPlaintiff: Well at first they wanted to know how I obtain the information to contact her so quickly-\nJudge: Oh-\nPlaintiff: Her ex-husband but that's what kind of-\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Her ex-husband contacted the department that evening stated that his son did do it and that he was not responsible because he was with her at the time it occurred.\nJudge: Okay I need to see something where the kid says he- marri- is there- okay father stop talking to each other where is that you said that the- that the police officer took a statement for the kid and the kid said he did it correct can I see that?\nPlaintiff: I don't believe that I have I- let me just-\nJudge: What are you talking about how do you not have that that's what I need and she admitted to me-\nJudge: Listen to me it's very simple question how are you proving cuz a burden is upon you to prove by a preponderance of the evidence her son threw a rock that damaged your car how are you proving it?\nPlaintiff: Because in her statement she says in her statement-\nJudge: Not- not there's no statement of the kid or there is and you didn't bring it?\nPlaintiff: I because of his age is a juvenile I am not allowed access to-\nJudge: So in her statement what- what do I- I read her statements yes I don't see it that's why- that her son did it and she wanted-\nJudge: Wait wait stop in her statements she says her son did it yes it's in there it's- okay hold on hold on hold on.

Why did you say that if it's- if you don't believe that to be true and that's not what you gleaned from the conversation-\nDefendant: I didn't finish my question-\nJudge: That's not what you glean from the conversation with your son you don't strike me as a shrinking violet-\nDefendant: No but when you have three officers in your house telling you that this is the statement has to be that's part of the investigation that I have-\nJudge: Stop stop stop so the plaintiff chooses to go after this one parent of one kid and there were other kids does that parent the defendant have to pay for the entire cost of the repair?\nHarvey: I think so.\nJudge: Why?\nHarvey: Because I caught one that's all I need then other one he going to tell on everybody else so yeah you going to make everybody-\nJudge: I'm going to get this one too fair enough have to pay all the cost not necessarily I think they have to take a look at uh everybody and take a look at-\nHarvey: They can only find one person one kid I'd say no really what do you think no.\nJudge: So that one parent who had a kid in the crowd doesn't have to pay anything?\nHarvey: Uh I will say it should be a split if it a five kid six kid-\nJudge: So you split it based on the percentage?\nHarvey: Yes.\nJudge: Okay we'll find out going inside the courtroom you're the same woman who the next day called IIA on him you know and you're not that person I understand that from somebody else but I don't understand that from the same woman who I'm talking to all this time right and who I know launched IIA against him probably I don't blame you because you felt pressured so you're not the person who said when you feel pressured you don't write falsehoods out of fear when you feel pressured you say who Do You Think You Are You chest bump and you call IIA so why would I believe you wrote that out of fear as opposed to that you spoke to your son and your son confessed to you see what I'm saying right.\nJudge: Okay what ended up happening you got sued by State Farm right?\nDefendant: Yes I did.\nJudge: $830 let me see that are you making payments at State Farm?\nDefendant: Not yet I haven't made payments yet because-\nJudge: Okay now you have the deductible of 500 the $800 and something dollars includes the $500 deductible right in other words State Farm only paid 300 and something correct I wanted to work it out civilly and arrange a payment plan as so what happ-\nJudge: Yeah I know but then you couldn't because then you came on too strong and blah blah blah you know you're doing the right thing going to court and you're going to end up paying cuz you live in a state where it's strict liability if it's malicious stuff and this is malicious stuff throwing rocks and damaging people's property is a deliberate act it's not an accident it's not negligence it's deliberate so yeah you're going to pay it I'm going to end up you know Finding against you and that's- that's how it works and that's how it works we don't kill your son for it we just make him pay and make you pay and then you know if it was my kid I might make him do a few chores around the house you know put a little dollar amount on each of the chores and then make them work it off you know um as for State Farm they may pursue you or they won't what they can't do is get the deductible twice in other words since I'm going to- he's suing you for the deductible I'm going to order a judgment against you for the deductible okay but more importantly what have you done what measures have you taken to make sure I-\nDefendant: A question how come I'm responsible for the whole deductible?\nJudge: I'm going to explain that thank you thank you for pointing that out and let me explain to you why here's why okay because there is a concept in the- in the law called co-conspirators and joint and several liability. If a bunch of people get together this is- I'm going to use an extreme example if three of us- the three of us get together and we decide we're going to rob a 7-Eleven okay and he's working at the 7-Eleven and he gets killed all three of us get charged by- me you two get charged with felony murder okay because the three of us are working in concert towards something and we're all liable for the results of the something okay now in a much smaller scale when people destroy property together because I think it's funny what ends up and the Damage that ensues they're each joint and severally liable for all of the damage and what joint several liability means that he can choose whom to sue he can do that and the reason why it's fair why the law deems it fair is because everybody was in it together so everyone's responsible for the ensuing damage got it now let's talk about the more important thing what have you done about the idea of your son throwing rocks over to the car or hanging out with kids who do or um like what happened?\nDefendant: I don't let him play with those kids anymore that's number one-\nJudge: That's hard though because they live in the same building-\nDefendant: It's not hard I just don't let them outside together they're outside you're not it's that simple um I've been taking him to my mom's house so he can play with the kids over there-\nJudge: Good and he's in counseling and he needs-\nDefendant: He's doing what he has to do-\nJudge: So are you-\nDefendant: Mhm-\nJudge: So are you $500 ready for the plaintiff good luck folks then.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection,evasion, playing the victim, gaslighting"}
{"id": "132", "dialogue": "Judge: The defendant has filed a countersuit for the remaining balance of the damages. All parties, please raise your right hands. Be seated. Come to order, please.\n\nCourt Officer: The litigants have been sworn, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas.\n\nCourt Officer: You're welcome.\n\nJudge: Yvon Diaz Loow, you are suing Vincent Lio for $5,000 that you say you are out as a result of his negligent driving. You are counterclaiming $446.64 that you say you are out as a result of her negligent driving. Let me hear what happened. Let me hear from you first.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I was on Motor Parkway. As soon as I crossed Old Willet P—\n\nJudge: Can you come on over here and tell me if that'll help you to describe what you're saying to me? Can you take a look at that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. That is only part. Okay, so go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: All right, as I'm about to—I have on my signal—as I'm about to get into the two left lanes, out of the corner of my eye, I see a black car come across. As I see the car come across, I start blowing my horn.\n\nJudge: Is it behind you or in front of you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it's coming out of a service station. I'd like to present this to the court.\n\nJudge: You can, but I'd like to understand what you're saying, so I kind of want you to verbalize it, too.\n\nPlaintiff: I did. I gave that in, too.\n\nJudge: Okay, why don’t you come over here?\n\nPlaintiff: Mhm. All right, this is Motor Parkway. He's coming straight across as I'm coming in this way. I see him out of the corner of my eye. I blow the horn.\n\nJudge: So you see him out of the corner of your eye. What does it look like he's going to do—go behind you or go in front of you?\n\nPlaintiff: He crosses the lane I had been occupying and continues to the second left-hand lane. As I moved over, I stopped so he could come across.\n\nJudge: So what happens now? He's in front of you, and what do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: I come around him because I do not want to stay behind him because of his previous actions.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: I just want to stay behind him and not move for a while until he's a few blocks up.\n\nJudge: Because he's crazy? If he did everything you're saying, he's crazy. So what do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: I moved back to the outer left lane.\n\nJudge: What was your game plan? To pass him?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not want to pass him.\n\nJudge: You just wanted him to proceed?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t want him in front of me.\n\nJudge: So what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: As I pull up, I look at him, and I expect—\n\nJudge: Wait. Is this the part where you turn around and engage with the guy who might have a gun in his glove compartment?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn't engage.\n\nJudge: Go back over there. Go back over there and then tell me. So you look over.\n\nPlaintiff: So I look over, and I just go [gestures]. I'm expecting him to say at least go like this [gestures] and say, “Thank you for being aware enough to see what I’m doing and avoiding a collision with me.” I'm expecting some thank you.\n\nJudge: And what do you get?\n\nPlaintiff: And he just—\n\nJudge: Gives you the finger.\n\nPlaintiff: Gives me the finger. I say, “Okay, fine.”\n\nJudge: Okay, fine.\n\nPlaintiff: When the light turned green, I see him look in the rearview mirror. He cuts—no signal, no nothing—cuts right back to the outer lane that I'm in.\n\nJudge: Okay, fine. I had enough room and enough time to actually hurry up and move back to this lane.\n\nJudge: So what are you guys doing? Racing? Putting the rest of us all in danger while each of you playing chicken?\n\nDefendant: We are going slow.\n\nJudge: Not your turn yet.\n\nDefendant: Okay.\n\nJudge: And it's close to where I live. 10 to 2 is the ending of—see, I understand. I’m from Miami. I understand road rage. I feel it. I understand that other people have road rage. I just try to say, “Okay, how am I going to get away from this guy?” The easiest way to get away from a lunatic is to just drive at 5 miles an hour until the lunatic has gone. They're out of your way.\n\n\nJudge: Please describe the events leading up to the accident.\n\nPlaintiff: I was driving within the speed limit, and as I approached the intersection, the defendant suddenly swerved into my lane. I had no time to react.\n\nDefendant: That's not true, Your Honor. I had my turn signal on, and the plaintiff was speeding. I was already halfway into the turn when their car hit mine.\n\nJudge: (looking at the police report) The report indicates that there were no skid marks from the plaintiff’s car. This suggests no attempt to brake. Plaintiff, why didn’t you brake?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have enough time. It all happened so fast.\n\nJudge: (to the defendant) The officer’s notes state that you did not yield the right of way. Can you explain?\n\nDefendant: I thought I had enough space. The plaintiff came out of nowhere.\n\nJudge: (reviewing further) The report also mentions a witness who stated that the plaintiff had the green light. Did either of you see the traffic signal change?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I had the green light.\n\nDefendant: I wasn’t looking at the light at that moment.\n\nJudge: (pauses) Very well. I’ll review the full statements and evidence before making a decision.\n\nJudge: The insurance companies found this 50/50. What is wrong with you guys? Is this how you lead your lives normally, or was this just a hot moment for both of you?\n\nDefendant: Perhaps it was a hot moment for both of us.\n\nJudge: Or perhaps you live your life normally like this.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Let me tell you something: don’t come down to my neck of the woods and drive.\n\nJudge: Case dismissed.

{"id": "222", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you. Unice Magnus, yes, you are suing TDR Construction, represented here by Tommy Davis, you’re the owner, yes? Okay, for $500, the amount that you say it’s going to cost you to repair what you say was bad work on his part. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Unice Magnus): Yes, on April the 13th, before April the 13th, a friend of mine introduced me to Mr. Davis. On the 13th, he came to the house. I showed him what needs to be done and I told him that I hired this other gentleman to do the job for $1,900.\n\nJudge: That's who you're referring to as the...?\n\nPlaintiff: The Mexican.\n\nJudge: Okay, you had gotten an estimate from the...\n\nPlaintiff: The Mexican, and the Mexican's estimate was how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,900. But then I... but the Mexican had a condition to the $1,900.\n\nJudge: And what was that?\n\nPlaintiff: For me to provide him with jerk chicken.\n\nJudge: Jerk chicken? Why? How did you come up with that?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I do jerk chicken for friends.\n\nJudge: And you sell it?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I just started. I just started selling it.\n\nJudge: So apparently he's tasted it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he's tasted it and it's really good.\n\nDefendant: Yes, it's good.\n\nJudge: Where is it from?\n\nDefendant: Well, no, I don’t want to ask Mr. J. Why did you bring it?\n\nPlaintiff: Because...\n\nDefendant: Where are you from?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m from Jamaica.\n\nDefendant: Where are you from?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m from Chicago.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you like jerk chicken. All right. You meet him and he’s willing to do it for... for he said he would beat that price. Okay, and he charged $1,700 and no jerk chicken. That was before you had tasted it?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s right.\n\nJudge: Right, but he said he would use my garage on his flyers, the before and after picture, and I would introduce him to other people for him to do the work. So that's why he was charging $1,700.\n\nJudge: They would take a picture of your garage and use it on flyers to advertise and he would expect you to send him business. All right, so you struck a deal with him. Do you put it in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I’ve been asking him for a contract.\n\nDefendant: Don’t start. If somebody’s going to do construction on your house, doesn’t give you a contract, then just don’t start. But in any event, he starts. He starts. What is the $1,700 to do?\n\nPlaintiff: I’ll have to just take each of your words for it and hope you agree since there’s no written contract. Go ahead.\n\nDefendant: They’re supposed to do the ceiling and the siding.\n\nPlaintiff: Eliminate two windows and put in a new window in the back of the garage.\n\nJudge: Do you agree that that was the scope of the work?\n\nDefendant: Oh, look at that!\n\nPlaintiff: Look at that.\n\nJudge: What do you say was the scope of the work?\n\nDefendant: I was going to do the roof and the siding.\n\nPlaintiff: What’s the roof? The ceiling or the roof?\n\nDefendant: The roof on the... on the ground.\n\nPlaintiff: I have pictures.\n\nJudge: I have ceiling, the ceiling is the inside, the roof is the outside.\n\nDefendant: The roof, you did mean the roof.\n\nPlaintiff: The roof and the siding. What about the windows?\n\nDefendant: Right, no, the windows I did for free just to help her out because she said you were going to do...\n\nJudge: But that was just going to be for free?\n\nDefendant: But so did you end up doing the windows or...?\n\nDefendant: I did the windows. I did a whole lot of extra. I did facing. I did around the top of the garage where she never has to paint again. I did a lot of different things for her for free.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, but she seems to be pretty unhappy with your work.\n\nDefendant: Well, she was loving my work. She said you do excellent work until I get these phone calls.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you have a contract with her specifying what it is you're supposed to do? If she’s under the impression that all this other stuff is included, wouldn’t a contract be a really good idea?\n\nDefendant: Well, I always write contracts. Like I’ll show you one of those...\n\nJudge: I don’t want to see a contract in another case. I want to understand why you don’t do one in this case.\n\nDefendant: Well, with her, we became friends and, you know, my mother came over visiting with her. They became real good friends.\n\nPlaintiff: Taste the chicken.\n\nDefendant: I tasted the chicken.\n\nJudge: It was really good.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, you said you two were friends. Would you make him sign a contract with you if he did work in your house?\n\nPlaintiff: I would definitely make him sign a contract just in case. Like he doesn’t abide by what we want, we don’t have any... friends are friends, business is business.\n\nDefendant: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Got your point. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nDefendant: All right, listen...\n\nPlaintiff: She’s unhappy with your work. At one point, the police are actually called to the job site. That doesn’t sound like things are going swimmingly. Who calls the police?\n\nPlaintiff: Why? He didn’t finish the job and he was asking for more money and I told him I’m not going to pay him until the job is finished. He was out there cursing, saying he’s going to tear down the garage if he didn’t get more money.\n\nPlaintiff: So I was afraid for... I was afraid for my life, plus my daughter’s life.\n\nJudge: How old is your daughter?\n\nPlaintiff: My daughter is 32, but she has the ability of an 8-year-old.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so, um, I had to call the police. The police came and we went over what happened, and of course, the police asked him for the contract and they said they could not do anything because there’s no contract. So he asked Mr. Thomas to write a contract.\n\nPlaintiff: And so did he... he wrote a contract.\n\nJudge: And did you give him more money?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him $250 because he promised he would come back on Friday, which he did, but the job was not finished. He was rushing to go to a dinner and he said he would come back.\n\nPlaintiff: What didn’t he finish?\n\nPlaintiff: He didn’t finish this side in which he said he would tear off. He didn’t finish...\n\nPlaintiff: What do you mean he didn’t finish it? Meaning he didn’t fix something that you brought to his attention, right?\n\nPlaintiff: He was... had...\n\nDefendant: What was it that you had brought to his attention?\n\nPlaintiff: It wasn’t aligned really.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: What else didn’t he do?\n\nPlaintiff: And the window is not cut properly, like it’s a blind person who put that capping on. I believe the way you said it in your complaint was, “It’s like Stevie Wonder did it.” Is that...\n\nPlaintiff: You’re just like the model of political correctness. Okay, so go on. Do you have pictures of that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Show me all your pictures.\n\nDefendant: So she pays you the last payment. Yes. So you think you’re done. When do you get the phone call from her?\n\nDefendant: Oh, I mean, I got phone calls through the whole job. Like the window was not part of the agreement at all. I did the windows for free. I have pictures that...\n\nPlaintiff: When the cops made you write a contract, you included the word “windows.”\n\nDefendant: They did not make me write it. I decided to write it.\n\nPlaintiff: When you decided to write a contract the day the cops came...\n\nDefendant: Uh-huh.\n\nPlaintiff: You wrote the word “windows” as part of the contract, right?\n\nDefendant: I would finish the windows for her, which I did. I finished everything. I have pictures. She wanted more than expected for $1,100, four done with the Mexican.\n\nPlaintiff: Huh?\n\nDefendant: You’re there. Just had to cook a little chicken.\n\nJudge: What’s this?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s an arm inside of what...\n\nDefendant: The window.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s the window. But what... what... I mean, the window has glass. What is that?\n\nDefendant: Oh, that’s the glass. You’re pushing the glass with your hand, right? Because it wasn’t...\n\nJudge: How does the glass not fall down and shatter? I don’t understand what’s going on.\n\nDefendant: It’s not glass. It’s plexiglass.\n\nDefendant: So it’s attached on the top and not the bottom.\n\nPlaintiff: Right, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And then what is that?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s where the siding meets, and shouldn’t be like that, right?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s where Stevie Wonder did the job.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. All right. And then this is your... these are your fingers inside of siding that doesn’t meet?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am. That’s the job you did, the wonderful job.\n\nPlaintiff: You have an estimate to repair?\n\nDefendant: What’s... what’s this picture supposed to show me?\n\nPlaintiff: The siding is not aligned properly.\n\nJudge: Oh, meaning that it doesn’t go like this?\n\nPlaintiff: Why couldn’t you just align these so that they were visually...\n\nJudge: The siding is not aligned.\n\nDefendant: Why wouldn’t you if you have a choice?\n\nJudge: Because it’s the same height on both sides.\n\nDefendant: Have these meet so that visually you won’t see that?\n\nPlaintiff: Like that?\n\nDefendant: Why would you choose not to do it? Do you understand what I’m saying?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Just throw two sides that doesn’t match that the same length. You know what I mean? They’re not matching at that corner.\n\nPlaintiff: They were. They were matching, but they’re not matching in the picture.\n\nDefendant: What do you think she did? Took all of it down, put it wrong, so she fixed it and then got it right again, like probably.\n\nPlaintiff: So come on. Look at my pictures. Those are my after pictures.\n\nDefendant: Those are his.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s how the garage looked.\n\nDefendant: Your pictures are the same as hers. There’s nothing different about the pictures.\n\nJudge: But I’m more concerned about, like the patch job around the windows, where her fingers can stick in, and the plexiglass moving. Why is that?\n\nDefendant: I have no... that’s the way her window was before we started, and that’s the way it was when we left because we do not do windows. We don’t do glass.\n\nJudge: I understand you don’t do glass, but why should the plexiglass move? If I can do that, I can reach into her garage.\n\nDefendant: That’s the way it was when we got there.\n\nJudge: Well, they don’t want it to be the way it was when you got there.\n\nDefendant: That was not in the agreement.\n\nJudge: But it is in the agreement, in your own handwriting, the windows to remove the windows.\n\nDefendant: I removed the window on the east side, on the north side, and the back.\n\nJudge: Mr. Davis, this cannot be your best work. You say that you can get it repaired for $500. I’m going to rule in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $500.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Evasion, Playing the victim, Emotional Appeal, Minimization, Deflection"}

Cassandra Jackson, you are suing Quenton Slaughter for $477 that you say he owes you when he broke your heart, your lease, stole your stuff, and ran off with your sister.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, we’d been dating for about two years. Recently, last year, we just moved in together for the first time, and everything was all right. But then it started... like, I know you want to go out on Fridays and be with your boys after work or whatever, but then it started getting to the point where it seemed like he was starting arguments about just any little thing—just to get outside. And then I noticed that when we had an argument, he’d go to his mother’s house and stay there.\n\nJudge: So you thought?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. I thought so. Come to find out, one day I’m at work, and he called himself leaving. But actually, when I came home, the stuff was gone this time. And I’m like, okay? And then that’s when I started calling and confiding in my sister. And she’s telling me, \"Oh, don’t worry about it,\" and everything. And she knows really what’s going on.\n\nJudge: What do you mean? You were confiding in your sister, telling her you were having problems with him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I was telling her I was having problems with him.\n\nJudge: What a good sister.\n\nPlaintiff: And then, meanwhile, she’s the one who’s running around with him behind my back.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Okay. So he moved out. Where’s your sister? Is she here?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: What a shame.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: So he moved out in November, which left you with December, January, and February’s rent. And you haven’t heard from him?\n\nPlaintiff: No. This is the first time I’m seeing him since.\n\nJudge: What about your sister?\n\nPlaintiff: I talked with her once.

I don’t talk to her.\n\nJudge: What did she say to you when you found out?\n\nPlaintiff: She said it never started out to be like that.\n\nJudge: Oh, no. It never does. It just ends up like that.\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly. And no one told me. I was left to find out all on my own.\n\nJudge: How did you find out?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, like I said, I started calling around, and my neighbors... when I asked about the furniture and stuff being moved, they said, \"Well, I saw your sister.\"\n\nJudge: Your sister was there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Helping him move?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Was she there telling him not to take it?\n\nPlaintiff: No. They were there taking it together.\n\nJudge: So what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff: I called.\n\nJudge: Who did you call? Your sister or him?\n\nPlaintiff: My sister.\n\nJudge: What did your sister say?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked her, \"Were you involved in moving the stuff?\" She denied it. I said, \"My neighbor saw you.\" Then she finally broke down and said, \"Well, it’s like this… me and Quenton, we’re together, and we’re living together now.\"\n\nJudge: Wow. Wasting no time, huh?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Is there another sister, or is it just the two of you?\n\nPlaintiff: Just the two of us.\n\nJudge: Wow. What did you do next?\n\nPlaintiff: I dropped the phone.\n\nJudge: Let me turn to the defendant. What’s going on, man?\n\nDefendant: Well, me and Cassandra were staying together or whatever, but all along, I was messing around with her sister.\n\nJudge: Wow.\n\nDefendant: Yeah. I ain’t want her no more.\n\nJudge: You what?\n\nDefendant: I ain’t want her no more.

What happened here?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nGood afternoon, Your Honor. I am a member of a multiple sclerosis support group, and Valerie was in charge of organizing a tour for us to go to Washington, D.C. So she sent a flyer—\n\nJudge:\nValerie, did you send the flyer to the group?\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nI submitted the flyer to the team leader.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nAnd we made copies and distributed them to everyone in the group.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nSo she submitted the flyer, and on the flyer, it was a trip to Washington, D.C., for the day to meet the Obamas—\n\nJudge:\nTo meet the Obamas?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nYes, for a tour of the White House and that the Obamas might be there.\n\nJudge:\nAnd the Obamas are going to be there?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nThey might be there.\n\nJudge:\nSo then it's not to meet the Obamas?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nNo. So we were hoping that we would meet them. We had submitted a letter to—\n\nJudge:\nLet me see the paperwork that you got—the advertisement that you got that told you what you were going to do.\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nThis is the flyer.\n\nJudge:\nIs there anything else besides this? Because this doesn't say much.\n\n(Looks at flyer)\n\nThis is just… probably the worst picture I have ever seen of President Obama.\n\n(Audience laughter)\n\nProbably the worst. He looks like Howdy Doody in this picture.\n\nOkay, was there anything else besides this?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nYou were going to have a White House tour, and that's why you bought your ticket?\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nNow, I need you to prove to me that at some point she said, “You will have a tour of the White House.”\n\nPlaintiff (Linda):\nOn the bottom, it says \"White House Tour.\"\n\nJudge:\nIt says… Let’s see this.\n\n(Reading flyer)\n\nIt says \"Farewell Obama Halloween White House Tour\" from New York to Washington, D.C., October 30–31.\n\nDo you have page two of this?\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nI have the full flyer here.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see what you've got.\n\nWas there a White House tour?\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nThere was a tour of the outside of the White House.\n\nJudge:\nBut why are you calling it a \"White House Tour\" in this title?\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nIt was a farewell to Obama tour.\n\nJudge:\nThat's fine if it said \"Farewell Obama Halloween Tour.\" But you put \"Halloween White House Tour.\" Why did you put that?\n\nDefendant (Valerie):\nBecause we were viewing the decorations on the White House.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nThis flyer here is not… She doesn’t have that.\n\n(Looks at flyer)\n\nThis one says we’re touring from the outside.

Next case on the docket: the plaintiff cashed a money order for her godsister, and it was bogus. Now she’s stuck. But the defendant says she had no idea the money orders were bogus. It’s the case of money not made to order.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Chantel Brown, you are suing Katia. You’ve asked us not to mention your last name for $2,412.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: $1,935 of it for money orders that she had you deposit in your account that turned out to be fraudulent, $400 for pain and suffering, $100 for some loan that has nothing to do with this, and bank fees. All right, tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I’ve known Katia for most of my life, since I was about 11 or 12 years old. Her son is my godbrother, so I consider her family.\n\nJudge: Her son is your godbrother? What does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff: It means that my parents are his godparents.\n\nJudge: Okay. Continue.\n\nPlaintiff: She called me at the end of February, I believe, about a money order. She said she was having problems cashing it because of her ID or something. She called me distressed. She was worried about paying bills and helping her mom out, things like that. So, as a loving friend and family member, I helped her out. She asked if I could lend her the money and then deposit the money order in my account, which I did.\n\nJudge: How much did you give her?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,900.\n\nJudge: That was the amount of the money order?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. To me, that was the same as cash. I didn’t think it was fraudulent. I didn’t think it was anything shady.\n\nJudge: Who were the money orders from? What kind of money orders were they?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m not sure exactly. She said it was from a company that she worked for.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t photocopy them before you deposited them into your account?\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Did the bank send you a copy when they reversed it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have it here.\n\nJudge: May I see that?\n\nPlaintiff: Sure.\n\nJudge: Where did these money orders come from?\n\nDefendant: I’m a mystery shopper.\n\nJudge: You’re a what?\n\nDefendant: A mystery shopper.\n\nJudge: What is a mystery shopper?\n\nDefendant: You’re paid to go into certain businesses and critique them—customer service, cleanliness, how long it took them to wait on you, things like that.\n\nJudge: That sounds interesting. How much do you get paid for that?\n\nDefendant: It depends. In this case, I did about four right around the holiday season of 2011.\n\nJudge: You did about four what?\n\nDefendant: Four different stores I visited as a mystery shopper.\n\nJudge: And they were going to pay you how much for that?\n\nDefendant: $1,900.\n\nJudge: To go to the four stores and do your Christmas shopping?\n\nDefendant: Well, it was divided among the four stores. I got my payment for being a mystery shopper, and they sent money for me to purchase everyday items.\n\nJudge: Did they do that?\n\nDefendant: Yes. That’s why when they gave me the money orders, I didn’t suspect anything. I had been with them for two years and never had a problem before. But when Chantel called to tell me that the checks were fraudulent, I called the company. I only got voicemail. No return calls. No letter. Nothing.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nDefendant: A month later, they told me the money orders were not fraudulent, but then they went out of business in California.\n\nJudge: So, you were left hanging.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But how are you both victims when she’s out $1,900 and you’re out nothing?\n\nDefendant: Because I depended on this company. I trusted them.\n\nJudge: But what are you out?\n\nDefendant: My time and work during the holiday season.\n\nJudge: That’s not the same. You didn’t lose money. She did. Did you pay her anything?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I gave her $600.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s not true.\n\nJudge: Did she receive anything?\n\nPlaintiff: Nothing. She called me the day after and asked for $100 to help her mom out. I talked to my husband about it.\n\nJudge: Husband, what do you know about this?\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: I know my wife asked me for $100 to help her godsister. She mentioned the $1,900 money order.\n\nJudge: Did she mention getting $600?\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: No, she did not.\n\nJudge: Did you get documentation for the $100?\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Show me the Facebook messages.\n\nPlaintiff: She tried to claim she only owed me $1,000. She even admitted she could start paying me back every two weeks.\n\nJudge: Did she ever say she paid you $600?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of paying her $600?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: That’s what I thought.

{"id": "601", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The Plaintiff hired the Defendant, a health care worker, to take care of his mom and says she was a no-show. But she says he installed cameras to spy on her. It’s the case of \"Smile, You’re on My Candid Camera.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Jerry Gardner, you are suing Helen Caitlin for $399.12 in gas money and lost wages because, according to you, she was hired twice to take care of your mother and didn’t show up. You had to fill in, and so you’re suing for the difference between what you would have made at work and having to fill in. Talk to me and tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. My mother is going to be 95 this coming August and she has home care 24-hour split shifts.\n\nJudge: What would be the qualifications of a person watching your mom?\n\nPlaintiff: They just have to be trained by the family or the people that are overseeing the patients. They do not require a certification or license.\n\nJudge: So do you have people taking care of her 24/7? How did you meet the Defendant?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. Through a financial fiscal intermediary, which is basically the agency who pays these people.\n\nJudge: Do they provide you with the people?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they’re only the paymaster, basically. But they have a community bulletin board where I search out and get people.\n\nJudge: So they don’t vouch for anybody. They just say, \"Here are the people who applied. It’s up to you to hire, screen, and fire.\"\n\nPlaintiff: Right. They don’t directly say these people are available, like an employment agency. There’s a community listing.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: Helen was trained. She was trained by me and by another worker who was there. She was scheduled to do Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays on the night shift.\n\nJudge: She was scheduled on a particular Friday. What day was that?\n\nPlaintiff: The first time she showed up, but the times she didn’t were April 28th and May 13th.\n\nJudge: So she showed up for one weekend?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I believe.\n\nJudge: When did you learn that she was not going to show up for the second weekend?\n\nPlaintiff: The day after. She was supposed to be there on April 28th, Friday, at 8 P.M., and she just didn’t show.\n\nJudge: How did you find out she wasn’t coming? Did she call you to say, \"Hey, I can’t make it\"?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she simply didn’t show up. The home health care assistant who was there all day had to work 24 hours.\n\nJudge: When do you first hear from her?\n\nPlaintiff: April 29th at 11:36 A.M.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you let them know that you weren’t coming?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t say anything to him.\n\nJudge: Did you say anything to anybody?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So you just didn’t show up for work?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t show up because the night before, he said I left his mother dirty and messed up.\n\nJudge: What day did he tell you that?\n\nDefendant: I think it was the Sunday before, something like that.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you just tell him, \"I quit\"?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Because you left them in a bad position where there’s nobody there and they think you’re showing up. When do you finally say, \"Hey, no, I decided I don’t want to work for you\"?\n\nDefendant: Saturday. I was at the doctor. That was because the prior weekend when I did work, I felt that he was abusive to me.\n\nJudge: How was he abusive?\n\nDefendant: He texted me constantly, checked cameras, accused me of not taking care of his mother properly.\n\nJudge: Do you have cameras?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And she knows that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but he watches everything we do.\n\nJudge: I don’t think you need to apologize for that. You’re taking great care of your mother. It may make people uncomfortable, but that’s tough. She should have told you she wasn’t coming back so you could find someone else.\n\nPlaintiff: She told me she had an emergency.\n\nJudge: So she lied. She didn’t say, \"You’re unreasonable.\" She told you, \"I had an emergency.\"\n\nDefendant: He was abusive. He checked everything we did, accused me of not working properly.\n\nJudge: So why take her back after she failed to show?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she would come back.\n\nJudge: You’re suing for lost wages, but you don’t have proof of a job lined up for those days?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I work per diem. I don’t have proof.\n\nJudge: Then I can’t let you do this. If someone is unreliable, don’t hire them again. You had the agency, you could have gotten a replacement.

So the purchase price was $90,000, right? And was there any money in escrow?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nIt was supposed to be $2,000.\n\nJudge:\nAnd was that money placed in escrow?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nNo, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nWhy not?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nHe never paid.\n\nJudge:\nNo, I know, but why didn’t you make him pay? Like, I don’t understand. That’s what the contract says.\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nYeah, he said—\n\nJudge:\nDid you have a lawyer?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDid you have a realtor?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nNo, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nWhose escrow account was it going to be put in?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nThe title company.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So did the title company—did you think the $2,000 had been paid, or did you know it hadn’t and you were letting it slide because you wanted to sell the place?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nWell, uh, I thought he was going to pay the total amount completely.\n\nJudge:\nRight, but when they do that, they’ve got no skin in the game, do they? There’s no $2,000 riding on it. That’s why you want to have the deposit. Otherwise, then it’s—okay.\n\nSo now, this contract is entered into in September. When was the closing supposed to be?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nIt was supposed to be 30 days. Actually, it was supposed to be on October 29.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And there was no financing contingency, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So where were you going to get $90,000 to buy this?\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nI was either going to purchase it myself with a partner or, as you can see on the contract, it said \"and/or assign.\" I was possibly going to assign my equitable interest to another party.\n\nJudge:\nWell, somebody has to come up with $90,000, though, without a financing contingency.\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nExactly.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nWell, after the time passed, he decided, \"Well, I'm going to get married, so please can you give me some extension on the side?\"\n\nJudge:\nSo you extended the closing, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nHe didn't come out with another excuse and said, \"I cannot pay now. Give me another extension.\"\n\nJudge:\nSo you gave him another extension. And now we’re in what month?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nNovember.\n\nJudge:\nNovember. Okay. End of November. And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nWe had to contact him and say, \"Are you going to pay or not?\" And he said, \"No, I’m not going to pay.\"\n\nJudge:\nRight. You see now why you take the $2,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nI know.\n\nJudge:\nFor your troubles, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nI know.\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nThe extension helped me, but it also helped him because the POS wasn't prepared.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s a POS?\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nPOS in the state of Ohio is something called a \"point of sale.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And what does that mean?\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nIt means that the property has to have certain checkmarks on all—well, it’s an inspection that has to happen. The government conducts it to decide if there’s anything wrong with it before the buyer buys it.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And what are you saying?\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nThere were a few incompliant things. He got mostly everything compliant except for the driveway. The driveway was the main issue.\n\nAt that point, the driveway wasn’t completed. The guy had some issues fixing the driveway, and he said, \"I’m going to have to get a whole new guy to fix the driveway.\" And that was the point where I said, \"You know what, I’m just going to move on from this property.\"\n\nJudge:\nNow, here’s the thing—I’ve read the point of sale law for Ohio. There are certain—I guess they’re trying to protect the next person buying from the next person.\n\nI don’t know. To me, you’ve got eyeballs. You know what you’re buying. I don’t get it.\n\nBut there are other states—there are states that say the sale’s not happening until this is fixed. But Ohio is not one of those states. What Ohio allows you to do is deduct the $1,600 from the purchase price.\n\nYou were allowed to close anyway, but you chose to walk away. I’m not sure that was one of your options.\n\nAnd now he’s out $160 that he paid to the title company, and he wants you to pay that.\n\nDefendant (Deir):\nHe never asked me to pay it.\n\nJudge:\nWell, he’s asking you now. When he sued you, that’s one of the things he’s asking you for.\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nAnd you didn’t just get sued for it seconds ago. You know that you were being sued.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have the proof of the $160 that you paid?\n\nPlaintiff (Ricardo):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nMay I see that?\n\n(Takes proof of payment.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay.

tomorrow uh I found out what's going on I made a substantial deposit the bank's holding it extra few days because I deposited it all at one time.\nJudge: Sounds like a load of soil.\nNarrator: My welcome back to the People's Court Harvey 11 here so the contractor doesn't pay you the first installment do you keep working or do you pull the plug pull the plug why because you're not going to get paid there anytime thereafter it's possible you would they may come up an excuse why you oh well I promise I'll pay you in a week uh agreement was first installment need to be paid first installment isn't paid I'd cut my loss would you cut your loss and pull the plug I'd pull the plug because the first installment wasn't paid and remember these guys didn't know each other so there's no history.\nDefendant: Even going inside the courtroom my bank if you deposit more than $110,000 they hold the entire deposit.\nJudge: Okay that's but that that has to do with something else but I what I don't understand is checks clear when they clear and um if you're hiring a guy for 600 bucks a day you want to get paid right you don't want to work all day and not get paid you think he does no he has to eat too so this work happened when?\nDefendant: In early October.\nJudge: The early October has a check cleared?\nDefendant: Check is cleared.\nJudge: So then why haven't you paid the guy?\nDefendant: Well this is what happened after he after the on the fourth day I went to the bank I my deposit hadn't cleared because they told me it was going to be available on Monday cuz I when I had made the deposit.\nJudge: Blah blah blah blah why haven't you paid him now?\nDefendant: Well the following week I met him I said Mike I'm going to come meet you I'm going to give you some of the money.\nJudge: How many days did he work three or four?\nDefendant: Three the fourth day he just sat there and he even invoiced me only for 3 days and then.\nJudge: So why did it become four because when the police were called.\nDefendant: The police were called out that day and didn't you tell the police it was 3 days correct but you want you want to get paid for the day that you sat there trying to get paid.\nPlaintiff: EXC uran I did work my machine I was pulling away and he was basically pleading with me to move this shed so he could finish the job so he could get paid from this homeowner so I I unstrapped my machine as a nice guy took the machine off went and moved the shed that took me about an hour.\nJudge: I thought you promised your wife you weren't going to work that day until you got paid.\nPlaintiff: I I I my heart.\nJudge: Did he really move the sh?\nDefendant: Big that happened on the third day when he moved the shed that I'm sorry that that's one of his blatant lies he's a habitual liar and here he is lying to you under oath.\nJudge: What so what was it after the police left you did this work?\nPlaintiff: No the police came is there a police report yes have it right here also also gave me two different credit cards to charge.\nJudge: Listen you so you had already what did you say?\nPlaintiff: He also gave me two different credit cards to charge which were no good here is the decline charges.\nJudge: Oh gosh CU he ran him the.\nDefendant: He ran him when I told him not to run him that's not true dude.\nJudge: Why don't you just you know we have a very simple saying you order up a hot chocolate you pay the bill for the hot chocolate. Why are why is your life so full of excuses you're like borrowing from Paul to pay Peter with I understand that times are tough but maybe you know maybe you shouldn't hire the guy until you have the money to pay the guy and if you're going to turn around and kite it like that then a day two days like this industry know my father's a contractor my brother's a contractor I know how this works I know exactly how it works and sometimes you may wait a day wait two days but not this not a month and a half and you still haven't paid the guy right it's inexcusable.\nJudge: Now apparently the homeowner paid you something right?\nPlaintiff: Yes and so did Derek DK I Derek and I were going back and forth through the texting and and he finally told me this they cleared part of a check part of a check was clear.\nJudge: Yeah because you know what he's probably got leans against him and he's being sued for something else and then he's got his own bills to pay just tell me.\nPlaintiff: Came out and gave me $350 cash is that ACC.\nJudge: Which I wrote on how much did the homeowner give you?\nPlaintiff: The the homeowner gave me a check for $550 because he did not want his house clean which I have the right to do.\nJudge: Which I don't know why you didn't do it if you did it the homeowner owes him money then the homeowner will pay you and pay him less money correct that's the whole idea behind mechanics leans it's supposed to protect you correct unfortunately the homeowner didn't owe him anything actually.\nPlaintiff: Der position for the homeowner to be in Derrick owed the homeowner money because he paid him up front now apparently he told the homeowner that his father died that he needed $3,000 to bury his father.\nJudge: So the homeowner felt horrible gave him the money and he gave him the money to bury his father meanwhile his father's alive and well was your father dead could you believe that somebody would do that is your father dead?\nDefendant: My my father Yes my stepfather is still alive.\nJudge: Oh my God here we go we don't know what's the truth out of this guy right now I I when did your father die?\nDefendant: In the in the end of September September 17th.\nJudge: You were doing this job yes.\nPlaintiff: I asked him about his daughter that's dying of cancer also that he kept telling me he's married and his and his daughter is seven or sixy old daughters dying of cancer ask him about that he kept telling me that it's in the it's in the text messages also.\nJudge: Do you have a six or seveny old daughter?\nDefendant: I have she's not my daughter she's a French child that I take care of.\nJudge: Oh my God here we go a French child that I take care of why are you taking care of a French child?\nDefendant: What because she's falling on hard times and.\nJudge: Did you say it was your daughter?\nDefendant: Yeah cuz it's a complicated situation and I've been helping her without.\nJudge: But you told him it was your own daughter.\nDefendant: I don't need to explain everything to him.\nJudge: No but it starts to sound like it's complete soil I understand you know it just to sound like you tell people whatever you think will give you more time to not pay them.\nDefendant: I don't know what you want me to say I was trying to help a friend and I was making.\nJudge: I I want you to to to to feel a little shame.\nDefendant: I do a little bit.\nJudge: A little bit I want you to feel a lot of Shame the guy's a hardworking guy he deserves to get paid.\nDefendant: I agree with that.\nJudge: Then and if you can't afford to be in this business then get another job I'm but you can't just make people work for you for free according to you the homeowner paid him the whole thing where did you get that from?\nDefendant: That's what I was told by the homeowner.\nJudge: Great show me prove to me the homeowner paid him the whole thing.\nDefendant: I have not been in contact with the homeowner since the storm yeah I have and I also told this homeowner that if I did receive any monies he would get his 550 back.\nJudge: Yeah but you don't that that's not how it works okay you can't sue for the homeowner that's I understand that so I'm going to deduct what the homeowner paid this is you know I mean the homeowner did that because the homeowner has an interest in not having a lean against him I'm going to deduct what he paid you and then what I have to figure out now is is it three days or four days.\nDefendant: No I have an invoice from him showing he only build me for three days.\nJudge: Let me see that page 77 on the uh on the text is it's in his own words he wrote to me I owe you $2,600.\nJudge: Yeah well you know if he's a slack Johnny got that wrong I don't care I need to get to the right evidence I have a text just a second just a second his inv what part of just a second was confusing to you two gentlemen sorry okay in the police report which according to you the police came after you moved the shed it was $1800 that you said that you were owed okay you have been paid $900 so far so you're owed another $900 and I'm entering a judgment in your favor for the $900 plus you're entitled to prejudgment statutory interest on that 900 since the day that it should have been paid to you which was October 12th plus you're entitled to your core costs so that you're not out

You are suing him for $5,000 for moving expenses, a security deposit that wasn’t returned, and loss of wages. But basically, you’re really mad about this security deposit not being returned. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiffs Explain Their Case\nPlaintiff: Basically, it was a long winter, so there was a lot of snow and a lot of stuff accumulating.\n\nJudge: So you folks move into—is it an apartment or a house?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s an apartment.\n\nJudge: Okay. And the apartment is owned by him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you had a very bad winter. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, there were pools of water on the roof, and we had very bad leaks.\n\nJudge: Did you complain to your landlord about the leaks?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Were the leaks fixed?\n\nPlaintiff: No. They said they couldn’t address it because it was dangerous conditions on the roof—there was ice and whatever.\n\nJudge: So when the ice melted, did they address it?\n\nPlaintiff: They addressed it in the spring, but by that time, mold had accumulated. We emailed them, we called them, we let them know—like, hey, you know, we have two children here.\n\nJudge: So you were seeing mold on the ceiling?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of it?\n\nPlaintiff: Actually, we have a video.\n\nJudge: A video?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Hold on, let me see.\n\n(Plaintiff plays the video.)\n\nJudge: Oh, I can actually see the dripping water.

Do you have the document given to you by the city?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here.\n\nJudge: Let’s see.\n\n(Judge reads the document.)\n\nJudge: Illegal apartment. Two legal Class A apartments were subdivided into four.\n\nDefendant: But that whole city block was torn down! The only building left was mine, so the situation changed.\n\nJudge: You expect people, in the event of a fire, to climb up to the roof and jump to the next building like Superman?!\n\nDefendant: In New York City, people—\n\nJudge: Just stop. The bottom line is that the city said what you did was illegal. That’s why they had to leave.\n\nEviction and Moving Expenses\nJudge: When did you get told to vacate?\n\nPlaintiff: The 16th.\n\nJudge: And you left on the 16th?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Where did you go?\n\nPlaintiff: The YMCA.

{"id": "109", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: The Defendant borrowed money from the Plaintiff. The dispute is over whether the Plaintiff has to just keep the rock climbing equipment he got as collateral or whether he can sue. It's the case of the antisocial climber.\n\nJudge: Mark O'Brien, you are suing Michael O'Callahan for $7,000. That exceeds—actually, you say he owes you more than that, but that’s your statutory max in Massachusetts: a $2,000 loan that you made to him that you say he hasn’t repaid, and $200 of an advance that you gave to him for work to be done. But you’ve decided to triple that to $2,500 and make it into a $7,000 claim.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. I’m dying to hear your authority for that. Talk to me—tell me what happens between the two of you.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I had known him previously as a result of his visitations to my cousin's garage. I got to talk to him, know him a little bit, knew what his background was—a tower climber.\n\nJudge: What’s a tower climber?\n\nPlaintiff: Builds cell phone towers, telecommunications.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: My cousin had a wind tower with a turbine on it back in the '70s, and there were problems with the turbine. Then the company went out of business, so he just left the tower up. The turbine was gone, and he said he’d give me the tower. I talked to Mike, and he said he’d take it down for me for a certain charge, and we agreed to do that.\n\nJudge: Wait, he would take the tower down, and you would put it where?\n\nPlaintiff: In Maine, on my property in Maine.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff: That worked out well. I paid him, he took the tower down, did a good job. Then he still wasn’t working due to an injury he said he had. So, I said to him, \"On the property where I’m caretaking in Massachusetts, if you need more work, I need help cutting and splitting wood.\" We agreed to that, and I paid him for what he did.\n\nPlaintiff: Then he asked me for a loan because he had gained my trust and confidence. So, I said, \"Okay, I’ve got the money right now, and I can loan you the cash.\" We wrote it down, and he gave me collateral to cover the value.\n\nJudge: Can I see what you wrote down?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry—do you mean you took notes, or do you have a contract?\n\nPlaintiff: We have a contract.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you loaned to him on February 16th of this year, and he was supposed to pay back on March 3rd?\n\nPlaintiff: He said he could.\n\nJudge: Who were the witnesses?\n\nPlaintiff: Michelle Sullivan and Jake Raymond.\n\nJudge: Did you sign this, Mr. O'Callahan?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: So you don’t deny that you borrowed $2,000?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Do you say to him, \"Hey, it’s March 2nd, you haven’t paid me, what’s going on?\" What happens there?\n\nPlaintiff: There was some communication and attempts to get repaid.\n\nJudge: Tell me about the $200 advance for work to be done.\n\nPlaintiff: After he took down the tower, I gave him $200 to put the tower back up in Maine.\n\nJudge: And that didn’t happen—why?\n\nDefendant: I just didn’t have the time to do it.\n\nJudge: And now you don’t want to work with him anymore because you don’t trust him?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Tell me your side, Mr. O'Callahan.\n\nDefendant: I don’t deny I borrowed the money. I was supposed to go back to work but didn’t because I had to go back in for another back surgery. I gave him my climbing equipment as collateral. It’s worth almost seven grand brand new.\n\nJudge: You have the climbing equipment, Mr. O'Brien?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nDefendant: He was at my house, and I told him to sell it, and it would take care of the loan.\n\nJudge: Why does he have to sell it?\n\nDefendant: That was the agreement we made.\n\nJudge: Show me where it says that he has to sell it instead of you selling it yourself.\n\nDefendant: That’s just what we agreed to.\n\nJudge: Why does he have to go through all the effort?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. Maybe there’s no buyer.\n\nJudge: Tell me about the work done cutting wood. You claim he deducted labor from the balance?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I worked, and he deducted $400 from what I owed.\n\nJudge: Did that happen, Mr. O'Brien?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Do you have it in writing, Mr. O'Callahan?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Mr. Raymond, you were there. Talk to me.\n\nWitness: Yes, Mark wrote it down each day. He paid me cash. He deducted from Mike’s balance.\n\nJudge: Verdict: $2,000 minus $400 for labor, plus $200 advance. Judgment for the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,800. But before I finalize, how does a $2,500 lawsuit become $7,000?\n\nPlaintiff: I wanted to open his eyes.\n\nJudge: That’s not how it works.

They went together.\n\nJudge: How did you find the motorcycle?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Craigslist.\n\nJudge: Right. And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): She started it for us, and everything looked fine. We bought it, we brought it home.\n\nJudge: You had agreed to buy it before even seeing it?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Well, we came down to look at it and then bought it.\n\nJudge: And you had negotiated the price before heading out there because it was quite a bit of distance?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Yes.\n\nJudge: How far away?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): About an hour and a half drive.\n\nJudge: How old are you?\n\nPlaintiff (Max): 17.\n\nJudge: All right.

Now, you’ve been corresponding with him?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Yes, I have them, a bunch of times.\n\nJudge: He looks young, doesn’t he?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you ever ask him how old he was?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Well, my daughter was there for a moment, and she asked him how old he was because she said he looked young as well.\n\nJudge: And what’d he say?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): He said he was 17.\n\nJudge: All right. This is a motorcycle that you're selling for $2,100. Had you had any problems with it?\n\nDefendant (Mary): No.\n\nJudge: How long had you had it?\n\nDefendant (Mary): I bought it in 2001.\n\nJudge: What condition was the motorcycle in?\n\nDefendant (Mary): Great.\n\nJudge: By the way, did you test drive the motorcycle?\n\nPlaintiff (Max): No.\n\nJudge: How come?\n\nPlaintiff (Max): She wouldn't let me.\n\nJudge: But then don’t buy it.\n\nPlaintiff (Max): No, I know.\n\nJudge: Why did you not let them test drive it?\n\nDefendant (Mary): Well, it was like I told him if he took the bike out and he dropped it, I wouldn’t have a bike to sell.\n\nJudge: But I didn’t find that to be unusual because, um, was the bike insured?\n\nDefendant (Mary): No, no longer.\n\nJudge: You didn’t test drive it. You buy it, and you don’t ride it the two hours home, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): No, we towed it home.\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): We started it. I said, “You know, I’m going to drive it.”\n\nJudge: Did you start it at all?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): We started it.\n\nPlaintiff (Max): Yes.\n\nJudge: Right, so we started it. Well, when we got home, the battery was dead. We had to charge it and then started it. The choke on, and then once it was warmed up, we turned it off. It wouldn't run without the choke on, so you couldn’t drive it.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Now, Mom, you get involved? Or does your husband get involved?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): My husband got involved.\n\nJudge: And your husband had how long has he been your… how long has he been around the boys?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Six years.\n\nJudge: So, he gets involved, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): He started going through the bike, talking with Max about it. I think they checked the oil first, and then they realized that the dipstick that he took out of the bike was dry. So they put oil in it right away, and then he started lecturing Max about purchasing a motorcycle without checking the oil.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): And he brought your other son there. What good was he, either?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Max, what’s the other boy’s excuse?\n\nPlaintiff (Max): He lectured both of them.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): But it was late. It was almost 11:00. We had work. He has school, so we said we’ll deal with it the next day. He would have to call her. I didn’t want him calling her at 11 o’clock at night.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): So, what were you going to call her and say?\n\nPlaintiff (Max): We were going to call and say that the bike wouldn’t drive.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): So the bike won’t drive, it has no oil in it. At this point, we’re thinking it’s just she hadn’t taken care of it. He paid well over book value, almost $500. Did you know that he was going to pay that much?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): I didn’t know anything about this motorcycle till I called him at 8:30 at night to say, \"Where are you?\" And he tells me he’s in Connecticut with his brother, buying, looking at a motorcycle. He hadn’t purchased it yet.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Oh my goodness.\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): And so he came—whose money did he use to buy the motorcycle?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): His own.\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Mary): Okay, I posted an ad on Craigslist. I had a motorcycle I wanted to sell.\n\nJudge: How long had it been since you rode it?\n\nDefendant (Mary): I rode it last, I believe it was in November. I went to make sure I had— I put gas in it, I wanted to fill it up.\n\nJudge: And why was there no oil in it?\n\nDefendant (Mary): There was oil in it.\n\nJudge: Did you have any concerns about selling your motorcycle to a 17-year-old boy?\n\nDefendant (Mary): I did know that he was 17, but I also know that he’s there with his 23-year-old brother. They were both talking to me about how he had owned a bike prior to and he was in the market for another one, and I didn’t see anything wrong with it.\n\nDefendant (Mary): Right. Um, I don’t see anything morally wrong with it. I mean, his mother knows he’s in the market for a bike. He’s traveling, you know, two hours away with his brother to get a bike. He’s not doing something illegal. I don’t see anything morally wrong with it. The problem is your own protection, and this is why virtually every state has laws about how old someone has to be to get into a binding contract. In your state of Connecticut, the law is that under 18, it's voidable. That means if he wants to say \"do over,\" he can, and he is. That’s why when you sell something, you don’t want to sell it to a 17-year-old child. You want to say to him, “You know what, your brother’s going to have to buy the bike and he can transfer it into your name,” but I’m selling it to the adults in the group because I’m not going to enter into a contract with a 17-year-old, because it’s going to be unenforceable. And that’s the pickle that you have right now.\n\nDefendant (Mary): I understand what you’re saying. However, I had made phone calls to motor vehicles and they actually put me through to their legal department, and I couldn’t get anything on paper.\n\nJudge: Did you do all that?\n\nDefendant (Mary): Excuse me?\n\nJudge: When did you do that?\n\nDefendant (Mary): Oh, that wasn’t just—that was just a couple of days ago.\n\nJudge: Right. And what happened when you called them?\n\nDefendant (Mary): They told me that a 16- or 17-year-old could purchase a bike from a private owner. He can do whatever he wants. The problem is that he now wants out of that contract.\n\nJudge: And that’s where you’re going to have—you’re not going to have a problem. He can do whatever he wants. The person who’s going to have a problem is you or whoever else contracts with a 17-year-old.\n\nJudge: He wants me to look at this and say, “Judge, this is completely unenforceable and I want my money back.” And he’s right. I have no choice. $2,100, verdict for the plaintiff.\n\nJudge: Now we have a problem. That bike is two hours away from you. The onus is going to be on you to get that bike. That bike belongs to you because you’re going to have to return the money. I’m going to give you 20 days. Is that long enough for you to get out there and pick up the bike?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): Yes.\n\nJudge: If you don’t, I’m going to give you a time limit. If you don’t pick it up, then you’re not picking it up. It’s yours. I want to give you a time limit. That’s fair. How long do you need?\n\nPlaintiff (Danielle): That will be fine.\n\nJudge: Twenty days from today. Make arrangements for you, at your cost, to pick up the bike because they’re not going to have a cost. It’s going to be on at your cost to pick up the bike from their place. Do not touch that bike.

{"id": "803", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please rise. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in the docket—the plaintiff rented an apartment to the defendant, and the defendant sublet to a dude who had tattoos and nose rings. But the defendant says he had permission to do what he did. It’s the case of the nose knows.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, William Peterman, you are suing your former tenant Richard Colville for $1,950—three months of rent that you say he hasn’t paid and owes you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, Richard was a good tenant. I had no problems there. What happened was he let me know that he was going to move. He said he had somebody interested in the apartment. I said fine. He moved, and right away must have given this other fella, this Ron, the key because before I knew it, he was in there with boxes.\n\nJudge: Okay, I’m sorry. When did you realize that Ron was in there?\n\nPlaintiff: Richard had told me that he cleaned up the apartment, and I went to go look at it.\n\nJudge: When did you go in to look at it?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I don’t know the exact date, but it was the end of March.\n\nJudge: End of March or the end of February?\n\nPlaintiff: The end of March.\n\nJudge: And Richard told you that he would be leaving when originally?\n\nPlaintiff: Originally, he said February, but it was March that he left.\n\nJudge: He changed it to March because he stayed in March?\n\nPlaintiff: He must have. Well, I didn’t get much rent.\n\nJudge: From him? What did you think was happening in March when you didn’t get rent? What did you think? Like, don’t you get rent at the beginning of March?\n\nPlaintiff: He was so good right along, I figured one month, you know, he was moving.\n\nJudge: But if you think he’s leaving, then what do you think is happening with the apartment at the end of February? In other words, “I’m leaving in February.” Okay, you’ve been a great tenant. No worries. Alright. He’s leaving in February. Aren’t you on the last day of February? No? He’s going to tell me we’re there to check the place and re-rent it. What did you think was happening in March?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought he was there in March.\n\nJudge: Thank you. I’m going to stay an extra month. I know he didn’t leave exactly when he wanted to.\n\nJudge: Did he tell you though, “I need an extra month, I can’t get out”?\n\nPlaintiff: You know, I can’t recollect exactly, but I think so.\n\nJudge: He calls at the end of March and tells you, “I’m cleaning up”?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He told me that he had somebody interested in the apartment, and I said, “Okay, fine.”\n\nJudge: That happens at the end of March?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: This other fellow moved in.\n\nJudge: When did the other fellow move in?\n\nPlaintiff: It must have been just the end of March at the beginning of April.\n\nJudge: Did you go by and take a look at the premises in March?\n\nPlaintiff: The later part of March, yes.\n\nJudge: Alright. There’s no security deposit here, right? So there was nothing that you needed to—so you go in the later part of March, and you see that the guy’s already moved in?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. I can’t say exactly what day it was. It was either March or just right at the point of March ending.\n\nJudge: And according to you, he gave you permission to hand that fellow the keys and the gate opener?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And how did he give you that permission?\n\nDefendant: By telephone.\n\nJudge: Because Ron told—Ron was a friend of yours, right?\n\nDefendant: Ron was a friend.\n\nJudge: Is Ron still a friend of yours?\n\nDefendant: Well, not now. I haven’t spoken to him since.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you call him and say, “I’ve got a friend who’s interested in the place. His name is Ron.” What does he say?\n\nDefendant: Okay, I gave Ron Mr. Peterman’s number, had him call Bill, and that’s it.\n\nJudge: Did you ever speak to Ron on the phone?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Oh, I thought you said you never met the guy.\n\nPlaintiff: We were on the phone. I told him I would have to see him, we would have to meet, and I would get the rent.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then did you have a lease with him or no?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he’s not a lease maker. No written lease.\n\nJudge: So, according to you, he tells you on the phone, “Yeah, Ron’s fine.” And then does he specifically talk about the keys and you handing them to Ron?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because Ron told me that—\n\nJudge: Oh, did he tell you, though?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because Ron told me initially that Bill told him to give him the keys. So I called Bill and said I wanted to make sure, and he said, “Yes, you can give him the keys.”\n\nJudge: Did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": " Gaslighting,Minimization,Deflection"}
{"id": "481", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please be seated. Come to order.\n\nJudge: Richard Youngberg?\n\nPlaintiff (Richard Youngberg): Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: You are suing Gina Early Ashby for $3,368, the balance that you say is owed for a funeral, plus interest on your credit card. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: I was engaged to Gina’s mother.\n\nJudge: How long were you engaged?\n\nPlaintiff: We were engaged for a couple of years.\n\nJudge: What’s a couple of years?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, um… probably about three years.\n\nJudge: Three years. And how long were you dating?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, 15 years.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. And you knew each other long before that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you’ve known the defendant since she was five years old?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I was there for her fifth birthday.\n\nJudge: You are 20 now?\n\nDefendant (Gina Early Ashby): 20, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Gina’s mother, Janice, sold her house so that we could move in together. In order to get a good price on her house, I invested money from my retirement funds, borrowed money against my house, and did labor to improve her property so she could get a good price for it. She sold her house in March of 2017 and moved in with me at the beginning of April. But unfortunately, she passed away at the end of May.\n\nJudge: What did she pass away from?\n\nPlaintiff: A massive intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nJudge: No known cause?\n\nPlaintiff: No one knows. She had a lot of medical problems and was on blood thinners. It’s considered a possibility that her blood thinner level got too high. She was in kidney dialysis at the time. When she started her dialysis treatment, everything was fine. But when they went to rouse her at the end of her treatment, they couldn’t get her to respond. She went to the hospital from there and was never responsive again.\n\nJudge: How old was she?\n\nPlaintiff: 52.\n\nJudge: 52. Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So, Christina and Gina and I were at the funeral home.\n\nJudge: Are you the other sibling?\n\nChristina: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, come on up. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: At the time, we thought she had a small amount of insurance, but it wasn’t enough to cover the funeral. Until Janice’s estate settled, the girls wouldn’t have had any money to put on it. So I agreed to put $6,000 on my credit card as long as I was paid back because I was already—\n\nJudge: Who did you have that conversation with?\n\nPlaintiff: With Christina and Gina.\n\nJudge: With both of them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you said, \"I’ll put it on my credit card, but you have to pay me back when the estate settles\" because they didn’t have enough money until then. Is that accurate?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, what’s your story about what the agreement was?\n\nDefendant: At the time of the funeral, Rick did us a favor and paid for it.\n\nJudge: No, but how does it come up? What is your version of how that came up that he would pay for it? You’re all sitting there, making a plan for the funeral, and the funeral home says it’ll be X amount. Then who says what next?\n\nDefendant: So, right. Rick says, \"Okay, I’ll put it on my credit card.\" The next thing we do is look at the obituary cards for my mother—the cards with the prayers on them. That’s the next thing we do.\n\nJudge: According to you, half of it has been paid off?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: When did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff: In September of 2017.\n\nJudge: She passed away in May of 2017?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Who paid you half of it in September?\n\nPlaintiff: Gina.\n\nJudge: Do you ever talk to the other sister as well?\n\nPlaintiff: I was told that Gina was in control of the estate, so I didn’t discuss it with Christina.\n\nDefendant: The reason why we paid that $3,500 was he said, \"If you do not pay back this money, you will get kicked out.\"\n\nJudge: Kicked out of where?\n\nDefendant: Kicked out of the apartment.\n\nJudge: Meaning his home?\n\nDefendant: His home.\n\nPlaintiff: I did not—\n\nDefendant: I went there because my mom moved in with him. That wasn’t my choice. I was 19.\n\nJudge: Okay, can I just understand? You were living there rent-free?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I was.\n\nJudge: That was since May when your mom passed away?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nDefendant: I also have these lists that he harassed me with—with the check numbers, what it was for, cash, and what it was for.\n\nJudge: What are you referring to?\n\nDefendant: I’m referring to—\n\nJudge: How is it harassment? What did he do?\n\nDefendant: He followed me around the house. He said if you do not pay this amount, he gave me lists. He was like, \"I expect you to pay this over time.\"\n\nJudge: Let me see the list you’re talking about.\n\nDefendant: That’s the only reason why we paid the $3,500—because he kept harassing me, saying if I don’t pay $1,500 in rent, I need to get out or move.\n\nJudge: But you keep calling that harassment. I think it’s perfectly reasonable of him to say you’re going to have to find a living arrangement.\n\nDefendant: It was the tone and the amount of times he did it. I could understand maybe once a week. But when you say it every day to a person who just lost their mother, it’s kind of— and you’re 19, 20—it’s kind of—\n\nJudge: I understand what you’re saying. I would not behave that way. I would have enough love for your mother not to behave that way. And I think that’s deplorable. However, it is not as though we’re talking about him saying that to you the week after your mother died. We’re talking about the entire summer passing. It’s now September or October, whatever it is, and he’s saying, \"Look, I’m carrying you.\"\n\nJudge: You know what? I am finding in your favor on that matter. I am ordering the remainder of the funeral cost plus the interest on this credit card, which I will take the time to calculate now.\n\nJudge: I know this is painful for you both. I hope you have good memories to hang on to and realize that even if she’s gone, she’s still a part of you.\n\nDefendant: Thank you.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Guilt-Tripping"}

I was still living in Virginia when I rented it. So, I moved in—my truck got there about 8:30 that night. I introduced myself, and he showed me the room. He had with him a friend at the time. I was exhausted—I have a couple of autoimmune diseases—so I was exhausted from the trip. All I wanted to do was go to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and started to unpack. The woman from the night before was no longer there. By that afternoon or evening, another woman was there.\n\nJUDGE: What do you mean by “another woman”?\n\nPLAINTIFF: That he was falling asleep with—I saw him go into the room with her. I come from a very conservative background, and it bothered me—two nights in a row.

Okay, go ahead.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I stayed there for the next three days and started to unpack a few things. November 26th was Thanksgiving. I left for Thanksgiving to go to my family’s house. When I came back that night, I found that my dirty laundry, which I had left in the laundry room, had been moved into the kitchen.\n\nJUDGE: Why would it be more appropriate for him to put your laundry—dirty—in the kitchen?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I didn’t know. It just bothered me tremendously that he would touch my belongings like that.\n\nJUDGE: You mean touch the basket?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, but he touched all my clothing.\n\nJUDGE: Why do you think he touched your clothing?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He moved it from the laundry room into the kitchen.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, go on.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I felt very uncomfortable there with all these different issues.

I did leave the house on December 1st, so I wasn’t in the house from December 1st until the 4th.\n\nJUDGE: Okay. But going to rent—so now, you have a document that you signed saying it’s a six-month lease, correct?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Does this document say anything about notice?\n\nDEFENDANT: As far as notice goes, there’s also a vacate release notice that she got, Your Honor, that says at least a 30-day notice is required.\n\nJUDGE: Where’s that? Did she sign that?\n\nDEFENDANT: Well, let me explain—she signed a six-month lease, and then—\n\nJUDGE: What goes wrong between you two, do you think?

That alone is reason enough for someone to want to move out!

The laundry basket move?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No, the different women, and then finding out about the cameras.\n\nJUDGE: I don’t find that legally uninhabitable. And now, you want the security deposit back?

All right. So what happened? You parked your car where?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, I parked my car across the street from my apartment, um, basically, um, I parked it between—it was parked between two driveways. Um, and I woke up, um, on the morning of September 18th and um, I was going to get coffee, um, walked outside, and my car was gone.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Um, I went—I proceeded to go to the business in which my car was parked in front of. I went in there and asked them, um, because I thought perhaps it may have been towed. Um, so I went in and I asked them. They had no—they did not, you know, have any idea of the tow, did not authorize a tow.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I then proceeded to call 311 because that’s typically where, you know, um, they have—they can look it up and see if any company tows a car, they have to log it in with their local precinct. That way, when—when someone says, \"My car has been stolen,\" the police know, \"No, it hasn’t, it’s been towed,\" or \"Yes, it has, it’s been stolen.\" Go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. So I called the local precinct after 311 told me they had no record of the car being towed. Uh, I called my local precinct, they also had no record of the car being towed, and they informed me, um, to call 911 and report the car stolen.\n\n**Judge:** So you did?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** You report the car stolen, and many, many days pass. And what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, so, um, I get a random call, um, in the evening one night from a guy from the towing company, um, saying to me, \"When are you coming to pick up your car? I’m tired of moving it around.\" And I was like, \"Excuse me? My car was reported stolen 18 days ago, what do you—what do you mean, uh, you have my car?\" So he tells me that they have my car.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And so, you know, I—I made arrangements to go there the next morning.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Um, I had to, um, also contact the police because the police had to come with me to take the alarm off of the car. It was—it’s a stolen vehicle when I arrived.\n\n**Judge:** Explain what that means.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, um, when—when the car is stolen, when a car is reported stolen—grand larceny—the police put an alarm on it so that, you know, if um, if I’m—if somebody’s driving my car down the street, the police will pick up that alarm. Um, the—the vehicles can pick up that alarm, so then they can stop the person.\n\n**Judge:** When you're saying an alarm—\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes?\n\n**Judge:** What are you referring to?\n\n**Plaintiff:** An alarm is what the police place on a stolen vehicle. It’s just a term saying it’s stolen, flagging it—it’s stolen.\n\n**Judge:** Exactly. For the love of God, I thought you had some special technology on your car and I want it in. Okay, I’ve got it. So now you go to the tow company to pick up your car.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And you actually, uh, did you video or audio the—the communication?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, yeah, I audio recorded the communication.\n\n**Judge:** Let’s hear this communication. This is you talking to the tow people?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n[Audio Recording Plays]\n\n**Judge:** You recognize the voice?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** What is he saying?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s actually—that’s a former employee that works for a company on the block where he was towed from, and he was explaining to him the po—I’m not familiar with that block, but the former employee that was actually in the office at the time works on the block. He’s explaining how the signs are set up in the area.\n\n**Judge:** Right, but how is he physically in there? What is he, his relation to you guys?\n\n**Defendant:** Oh, he just popped in to say hi.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, so he was fighting the fight with him? He’s not a disgruntled employee?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** He happens to explain to him. Is he the one who called you guys for the tow?\n\n**Defendant:** No, not at all.\n\n**Judge:** Who called you guys to tow the car?\n\n**Defendant:** Um, this was just called in as a blocked driveway.\n\n**Judge:** So who called you guys?\n\n**Defendant:** I have no clue.\n\n**Judge:** If it's ticketed, we pick it up.

I’ll let you know in a few days.\" In the end, from the day the guy signed the contract, and he wanted me to be a volunteer to give him all the money.\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nWell, that’s—I mean, that’s interesting, because he’s suing you. He wants the only money that ever went from here to there is the $500, right?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then the contract that you have with them says you’re going to get 67% of the fares, right?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nThe contract with Partners Executive says you will get what percentage of the fares?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nHe gets 67%.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Why do you look at me like I'm from Mars when I just said that, and you looked at me?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nNo, no, depends. They have percentages. If you look, you read all the contracts. At the same day, it’s 53%, 26%, whatever. In his case, because he hasn’t been paid, in his case, it’s the larger, 67%.\n\nJudge:\nSo, in his case, he’s entitled to 67%. So, and his demand letter is asking for 100%, right?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nI got it. So, he wants you to pay him the 67%, but no, he wants you to pay him 100%, plus he wants you to return the security deposit of $500, even though you drove the car for 4 days. And you’re only entitled to get a percentage of the fees if you pay rent. You can’t not pay rent for the car and then get the percentage of the fees.\n\nJudge:\nSo, I don’t know. You sound a little greedy if the guy who runs the car service says, “Oh, you’ll make a certain amount of money,” and he doesn’t.\n\nJudge:\nCan the guy bail?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nNo, he can’t bail. I mean, why?\n\nJudge:\nA contract’s a contract. You know, there are certain stipulations that may have been discussed, however, I get your point. Going inside the courtroom, your answer to this is, “Judge, I don’t want to pay him anything, not even the 67%.”\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nNo, I don’t say this. What are you saying?\n\nJudge:\nIf I owe him, I owe him maybe $100, even not this. But why waste time? I pay $6,000 insurance a year, $20,000, $22,000 cost me this car, and somebody signed a contract like it’s nothing. I can keep going. I can pick… Get—did you guys promise the drivers that they’re going to make a certain amount a day?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nWe don’t promise nothing.\n\nJudge:\nIs there anything in the contract guaranteeing you that you’re going to make—?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nOf course not.\n\nJudge:\nMaking... Listen to my question. Is there anything in any of those contracts that say you’re going to make a minimum of $250 to $300 a day?\n\nDefendant (Abraham Shen Hav):\nNothing.\n\nJudge:\nNo, not in contract.\n\nJudge:\nMan, the only way he’s wrong is if you are allowed to stop the contract, and the only way that can happen is if you’re able to prove to me that someone, despite the three contracts you signed, where they don’t guarantee you something, that someone guaranteed you something.\n\nJudge:\nI mean, at what point is there a little personal responsibility in this life, whereas sometimes it’s just a bad business decision? You may—you know, you may have done this for four days, and you may decide this isn’t for me. I’m not making enough money. It’s fine. But is there ever a consequence for people signing something and then making a business decision like that? Why does somebody else have to pay for that business decision? Why isn’t it just something that, all right, I’m going to cut my losses and move on?\n\nJudge:\nYou know, you were supposed to drive that car for 6 months and pay $450 every week for six months. He’s not chasing you for that.\n\nJudge:\nI find it…\n\nJudge:\nEven though he signed a contract and he’s got to stick to it.\n\nJudge:\nStep on in here. What’s your feeling about the verdict now?\n\nPlaintiff (Hamid Shree):\nActually, I feel like maybe I didn’t convince the judge like what happened, but looks like I lose all my money.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you stick with the job and try it for a little bit longer?\n\nPlaintiff (Hamid Shree):\nBut they made a promise you can make it.\n\nPlaintiff (Hamid Shree):\nThat’s the main thing.\n\nJudge:\nAlright.

{"id": "246", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff hired the defendant to do his taxes and says that the guy kept his refund check. But the defendant says the refund was his payment. It’s the case of 1040 over and out. Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Tahiru. How did you find Mr. Anafi in order to ask him to do your taxes? Had he done any of your friends' taxes? Was he recommended? How did you two find each other?\n\nPlaintiff: I was passing by and I saw the tax sign on the wall.\n\nJudge: So what was the agreement? That he would do your taxes in return for how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $200.\n\nJudge: Okay, and what kind of taxes were these?\n\nPlaintiff: The ones that people do every year.\n\nJudge: The income tax. Do you have them with you? The taxes that he did?\n\nPlaintiff: I do.\n\nJudge: May I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Sure.\n\nJudge: Alright, so you go in to see him. Do you sign any contract with him?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: So it was just verbal?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Alright. So you speak to him, and then do you come back with your records, or did you have them all with you right then?\n\nPlaintiff: I spoke to him, then I went to my job and got the printout.\n\nJudge: Now, what do you do for a living?\n\nPlaintiff: I drive a taxi.\n\nJudge: According to you, do you have a signed contract with him that states your rate?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: May I see it? Is that a signed contract?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am. That’s the actual contract because I have previous ones from 2014.\n\nJudge: The same thing? You did his taxes in 2014?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am. Since 2014, I’ve been doing his taxes.\n\nJudge: You’ve done them since 2014?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You did 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017—let me see the contract information you had on those.\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Have you always charged him $850?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You’ve always charged him $850?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Is this the first time you’ve done your taxes with him?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: What does he always charge you?\n\nPlaintiff: $200.\n\nJudge: Every single time since 2014?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I always pay in cash, and he gives me a receipt.\n\nJudge: That’s important because if you’re going to argue to me that he’s always paid $850, don’t you think it would be really compelling for you to show me proof?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: The form you gave me has a date of 2018. Who put that date, him or you?\n\nDefendant: Him.\n\nJudge: Oh, so he’s the one who wrote it. It would be nice if that document said 2018 taxes—it doesn’t. You also told me you had four different times he agreed to that rate. I’d like to see that.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know about it.\n\nJudge: Why did you take the $200 from him?\n\nDefendant: Because he doesn’t do his taxes in one sitting. He comes five different times. He brings one document, then another day, another day. He doesn’t sit down and do it all at once.\n\nJudge: Did you give him a receipt for the $200?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: What did your receipt say?\n\nDefendant: $200 for a down payment.\n\nJudge: Can I see the receipt?\n\nDefendant: Oh my God.\n\nJudge: I see what it says. We have a problem.\n\nDefendant: What’s the problem?\n\nJudge: You wrote $200, and then underneath, you put a zero, like the balance is paid.\n\nDefendant: The reason I did that was because he wanted a receipt for the $200.\n\nJudge: So why didn’t you write, “$650 still owed”?\n\nDefendant: Because that was going to be taken by the bank.\n\nJudge: It doesn’t matter how you collect it. What matters is that you document that it’s owed. Because he is arguing that you’re a liar and that he never owed it. He says he paid in full.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s my signature, but I never signed this paper. I don’t recall signing this paper.\n\nJudge: So what is it, magic? How did it get there?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know how it got there. I swear I never signed it.\n\nJudge: Does it make sense that an accountant would say, “I’ll just keep your refund check as the fee”?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it doesn’t make sense.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nPlaintiff: Because it’s my money. The check should come to my name, not his.\n\nJudge: Who whited out the date on the contract?\n\nDefendant: Not me. If I whited it out, I wouldn’t bring it to court.\n\nJudge: Why did you put a different routing number instead of his bank’s routing number?\n\nDefendant: That’s how I operate in my business. I serve people in depressed neighborhoods who can’t afford to pay upfront.\n\nJudge: But you chose the bank to receive the IRS deposit?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You each have one week to provide documentation. If I don’t find evidence supporting your claim, you will be refunding any additional money taken. This document makes it look like $200 was the full payment.\n\nDefendant: I will try to find the documents.\n\nPlaintiff: I will check my bank for the check deposit proof.\n\nJudge: Good luck to you both.

{"id": "767", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Joe Gonzalez, you are suing Deborah. You've asked us just to refer to you by Deborah, and we'll respect that, for $1,366 that you say you have loaned her or fronted for her at various times when she was down and out, and now she won't pay you back. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Um, yeah, me and defendant have been friends for, you know, approximately about three and a half years.\n\nJudge: Were you romantically involved?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): No, never romantically involved. Uh, and basically, you know, we met at a pool hall and became friends then. And basically, we never had... what a pool hall?\n\nJudge: Po' Hall?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes, uh, when she asked to move in with me, and basically, you know, for a period of three weeks, and, uh, basically, you know, she, uh, asked, you know, basically for money loans for necessities.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait, wait. She asked what? To move in with you?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes, for a period of three weeks.\n\nJudge: For a period of three weeks?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes.\n\nJudge: So she had, uh, an opportunity to save money and get her own place?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Okay, and, uh, she had also asked me if I was able to front her, you know, like the security deposit because she wouldn't have enough within that three-week time period.\n\nJudge: And why did you say yes?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Oh, uh, you know, I believe in helping out friends. I'm a good-hearted person, basically. You know, I do help friends out when they're, you know, when they're in need.\n\nJudge: She thinks that you were barking up a tree that it wasn't so altruistic?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): No, I never hit on her. Never was, I mean, um, basically, when we first met, I basically asked her if she was dating somebody, but that was three and a half years ago, right? I never pursued her after that.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so you let her move in?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have kids?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): No.\n\nJudge: Okay, uh, so it's just you, and she was there?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, and then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Three weeks turns into two months.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Two months, and then, uh, you know, in the meanwhile, she was asking for money, you know, to pay car insurance.\n\nJudge: And were you keeping track? How were you keeping track of what you were loaning her?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Well, basically, I made notes on my cell phone, and basically, I put it down on a Word document of order. And can I see the notes on your cell phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): And I saved the receipts of, um, you know, all the stuff that I paid for. Handing it to my bayth.\n\nJudge: Please.\n\nJudge: Okay, so let me just ask you this then. How were you memorializing the loans that you were making to her? Like, were you having her sign a promissory note? How were you having her—\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Oh, the times that I asked her to sign a promissory note, she refused, and she said don't give her the money, and then she basically said you're in control, you're the guy with the green in the pocket.\n\nJudge: Somebody says I refuse to sign a promissory note, that's your hint right there, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Right, and then, you know, she’s like, oh, you got to, you know, in text messages that I'm going to pay you back and, you know, so forth and so forth. And basically, we had made agreements that she was going to pay me every two-week, every pay cycle of $500. She was going to make the payments, and every time it came time to make the payments, she always had a different excuse.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): And then, um, she stated that—how long did she live there for?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): For two months, from June 6th to July 29th.\n\nJudge: So she moved out in July?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): July 29th.\n\nJudge: And at that time, did you tell her how much you think she owes you?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Well, I've told her during the time, basically, that, you know, you basically—you’re racking up quite a bit amount of money here, and basically, she kept promising that she was going to make payments, and then every time was a different excuse.\n\nJudge: Right. So why’d you keep loaning her money?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Because I'm a softie.\n\nJudge: Yeah, because she thinks you're barking up her tree.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): No, I don't have any romantic feelings for her.\n\nJudge: So why’d you give her the money?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Like, I understand stupidity when you like somebody. I don't understand stupidity when someone is not, you know, living in your house freeloading as you described.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Well, yeah, I mean, that's the reason why I just got fed up and said you got to go.\n\nJudge: And how long after you said you have to go did she go?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Within two weeks.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then after she left, did you have contact with her?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me hear your side.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Um, I do. I'm not going to s and hiy. Um, I do owe him like $400.\n\nJudge: Oh, you already lied because in your answer to the complaint you say you're not going to sit here and lie. You're going to stand there $400.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): No, you said he gave me $400.\n\nJudge: Wait a second, where in the complaint do you say you owe him 400 bucks?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): No, you said he gave me I owe him up to like $400.\n\nJudge: Where is that? Show me where that is.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): It says in the—I, because here's what I'm reading. Just a second. Here's what I'm reading. With your signature, he has no proof because I don't owe him anything. Exclamation point. But he gave me $400.\n\nJudge: No, then I apologize. I didn't read that thoroughly.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): I just saw the 400.\n\nJudge: Why see—let me tell you why I am grilling you like a cheeseburger right now.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Because he mentions he's got texts, he's got emails where you admit to owing money, and all of a sudden now, yeah, yeah, yeah, I owe him $400. I did say that. I'm sorry, I did say that.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): I actually brought this that showed you that I do owe him $400.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): See that, please?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): And I also have texts in my phone. I do have the texts that show that he did state where you're right. I did think you moving here, um, you would change your mind.\n\nJudge: Let's listen. Did he actually come on to you?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Yes, very much so. I have texts repeatedly. \"I love you, I miss you.\" It was like a controlling thing. He moved me in to try to see if I can fall in love with him. Money, money, money. He did nice things for me, then it was always, \"I love you, I miss you. DJ misses you. He's my dog now.\"\n\nDefendant (Deborah): And it was just repeatedly like—during work or what?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Every time I'll be at work, I'd get texts. I could be out with my girlfriends, I'd get texts repeatedly, and I'm like this is not—I’m not here, I’m not your girlfriend. You're doing me a favor, I'm getting on my feet, I'm moving out.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): And it was repeatedly, repeatedly, and I had a little less—\n\nDefendant (Deborah): You talk a little more, you show sorry. There it is, it's me. That's my statement.\n\nJudge: Everything started getting very uncomfortable.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): You can also find that I love you but it's like long, repeated... drawing out texts in there.\n\nJudge: Okay, just relax.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): He keeps asking you to play on his bar league.\n\nJudge: How good are you at pool?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Um, actually very good. I've been to Vegas and won a national champion so far.\n\nJudge: I'm not seeing the stuff that you're saying. I'm seeing him saying things like, \"Are you coming home today?\" because I guess you hadn't come home the day before or something. He said, \"Yeah,\" you answer, \"Laugh out loud.\" \"Yeah, be home shortly. My doggy is sad.\" Then did you—he asked you, \"Did you eat yet?\" I mean, that's the roommate being polite.\n\nJudge: Sitting with my girlfriend. Okay.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): I was going to make you chicken salad for dinner.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I met her for sushi. I took the—\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Then he says, I took the air conditioner apart and found some wires melted together at the switch. I repaired the wires and tested the unit. It's not working for now. Please don't use the super-cool function; it will cause the same issue.\n\nJudge: What was the issue?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): That it wouldn't turn off.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Well, she constantly had the AC blasting every night, and basically, she shorted it out because the wires overheated, and the wires inside the unit melted together and shorted out, and the breaker actually tripped.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Man, it was still working. It was his way of not doing it, playing childish games when he didn’t want me to have it. I even offered. He has my AC unit from my storage unit at his house, and plus other personal things that I left there, clothes-wise.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): The reason why I would not pay the $400 back to him is because he would not give me my stuff back when I brought the officers there.\n\nJudge: So where’s your stuff?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): It’s at his house.\n\nJudge: What exactly do you want from me?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): You know what, I’m pretty much done.    Judge: What exactly do you want from me?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): You know what, I’m pretty much done. I don’t want to deal with him anymore. I want my stuff back. He hasn’t given me my stuff back.\n\nJudge: So you want your personal belongings returned?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Yes, I want my clothes, my AC unit, and whatever else is in his house that belongs to me.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): The AC unit is in my storage unit, and all her stuff is packed up. She can come get it. I’ll even help her load it in the car.\n\nJudge: So, you’re saying her belongings are packed up and she’s welcome to come get them?\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Yes, they’re all packed. She can come by, and I’ll help her with the moving, no problem.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): I didn’t feel safe going over there by myself. The officers were involved, but he still wouldn’t give me my stuff.\n\nJudge: You mentioned you called the officers. Were there any official complaints filed or just a visit?\n\nDefendant (Deborah): It was just a visit. I didn’t file a formal complaint. I just wanted my stuff back.\n\nJudge: All right, let’s review what we have. Joe, you have an agreement that she will pay back the $400, and you do have texts that acknowledge that she owes you money, but you don’t have a formal promissory note. Deborah, you’re admitting that you owe the $400 but are refusing to pay it because you feel like you didn’t get your belongings back.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Yes, I don’t think I should have to pay him until he gives me my stuff.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): I’ve been offering to give her stuff back. She can come get it whenever.\n\nJudge: Well, the question of the debt is a separate matter. I’m going to instruct both of you to work out the return of the personal property immediately, but let’s talk about the $400. Joe, you’re asking for this repayment because you loaned her the money. Deborah, you’re agreeing to the loan, but you’re claiming it’s tied to receiving your things back.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): I’m happy to give her her stuff back. I just want the money she owes me.\n\nJudge: I see. Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m ordering that the property be returned. Deborah, you will come pick it up at Joe’s convenience, and Joe, you will make sure she gets everything back in the condition it was in. As for the $400, I’m ruling that it must be paid back immediately, with any remaining balance due within 30 days.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): I can’t pay it right now, but I will in the next couple weeks.\n\nJudge: Well, I suggest you work that out, but there’s no excuse for not paying a debt you’ve acknowledged. If there’s an issue with the payment plan, let Joe know and work something out, but it’s expected to be paid. I don’t want to see this go any further.\n\nPlaintiff (Joe Gonzalez): Understood.\n\nDefendant (Deborah): Understood.\n\nJudge: Good.

I don't want to say felon.\n\nJudge: You are suing for $388 that you demand they pay you for breaching their contract, I guess. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, on December 30th, I pulled over to their parking space and inquired about long-term parking for 10 days while I went to Puerto Rico. I was arriving on my flight returning from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on January 8th at 11:05 PM to arrive January 9th at 2:00 AM. So, I explained my days to the young man.\n\nJudge: Did you explain to the young man when you'd be returning?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I told him January 9th at 2:00 AM.\n\nJudge: And he printed it up the way he printed it on this document? Let me see that document. That's how he printed it up?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, except he put January 8th at 3:00 AM.\n\nJudge: But that's actually January 9th?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly. That was his error.\n\nJudge: Doesn't he write down exactly what you say?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: And weren’t you like, \"I'm returning on the 8th\" because that's the day of your flight, and you weren't really doing the math that it would be the 9th?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: That's not good for you if you didn’t realize it, but I don’t think he’s making an error. He doesn't know when your flight is; he just writes down what you say, right? He's not analyzing your airline ticket and trying to figure out the time zone difference.\n\nJudge: So, you said you were leaving on the 30th and coming back on the 8th, and that's what he wrote down. But you don’t come back on the 8th; you come back on the 9th. However, I see you were charged for 10 days and were given a free day?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How were you given a free day?\n\nDefendant: We had a special at the time. Every seven days, you get one day free. The quote he received was for nine days, but he actually returned on the 10th day and past the designated time, which put him into another day.\n\nJudge: When did he come to pick up the car?\n\nDefendant: On the 9th at about 5:00 AM because his flight was late.\n\nJudge: And he was supposed to be there on the 8th at 3:00 AM according to the documents?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So he got charged for an extra day for coming an extra day later?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why are you here? Because you’re mad they charged you an extra day?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: We were delayed because—\n\nJudge: I don’t care why you were delayed. I care if they overcharged you. How much did they charge you?\n\nDefendant: $194.\n\nJudge: And that’s for how long?\n\nDefendant: Two more days.\n\nJudge: Two more days because A) he came a day late and B) he came past the designated time. That would be $18.70 times two, which is another $37. That plus $156.60 makes the $194. But you’re not even suing for $37—you’re suing for $388. How do you figure?\n\nPlaintiff: They quoted me a price, and they honored that price. I asked the attendant if this was exactly what I was going to pay. He said yes.\n\nJudge: If you came on January 8th by 3:00 AM. But did you?\n\nPlaintiff: When I arrived and was informed of the price, I tried to speak to the manager but was unable to.\n\nJudge: Because you were wrong. Are you guys shocked that maybe you didn’t realize this before you filed the lawsuit?\n\nPlaintiff: But we called them twice!\n\nJudge: Okay, you were late by two days. Should we sue JetBlue for making you late then? No. You botched it because you were supposed to tell them you were coming in January 9th at 3:00 AM. Either way, you should pay.\n\nPlaintiff: I made an attempt to speak to the manager.\n\nJudge: What’s the bottom of it? You spent two extra days before picking up your car.\n\nDefendant: We even offered to refund the $37, but he refused and wanted the full amount back.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, how long have you been dating?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: Almost three years.\n\nJudge: He’s headstrong, right?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: Yes.\n\nJudge: Someone offered you $37, and you refused it. That’s not principle—that’s pig-headedness.

You say you’re actually out $5,000 for a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria that he damaged when, according to you, he was at fault in an accident. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Jason Gore): Correct. Okay, uh, it happened on September 13th. I received a phone call from my wife—she was involved in a little fender bender. So I went out to assist her.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay. Who is that with you?\n\nPlaintiff: This is my wife.\n\nJudge Milian: So she had an accident?\n\nPlaintiff: She had an accident.\n\nJudge Milian: That same day?\n\nPlaintiff: Same day.\n\nJudge Milian: So you go out to assist her?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge Milian: And on the way home, you have an accident?\n\nPlaintiff: On the way home from assisting her, I have an accident.\n\nJudge Milian: That is one of the worst things I’ve ever heard—well, not the worst, but pretty bad.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it was surreal.\n\nJudge Milian: Oh my gosh.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. But you know, I went to assist her, everything was fine. That turned out to be just a little fender bender, nothing to be concerned about. She was all right, everything was good.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So we're on the way home…\n\nJudge Milian: Both in the same car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she’s in her own car. She’s in a separate car. I’m traveling in my car.\n\n[Demonstrating the Scene]\nJudge Milian: There are two intersections. Why don’t you come over here and pick a car to represent you?\n\nPlaintiff: I'll take the Impala.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay. This is your 1999 Crown Victoria, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge Milian: And this is underneath a bridge? What kind of bridge?\n\nPlaintiff: A train bridge.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay. And the stop sign is actually further back from the corner?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. There’s a pedestrian pathway along the road. The stop sign is actually back here. So if you stop at the stop sign, you cannot see if anybody is coming down the walkway. You have to creep up to the corner.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I did exactly that. I saw no one coming down the pedestrian path. I turned to my right—no one. I turned to my left—there were a couple of vehicles down the way. Then I look back, and I see the truck coming at me.\n\nJudge Milian: So where was your car when the impact happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Right here.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I looked right—no one. I looked left—cars were coming. When I looked back right, his truck was already there, coming straight into me.\n\nJudge Milian: Did you see his face?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I saw his expression.\n\nJudge Milian: And what did it look like?\n\nPlaintiff: [Mimics shocked expression]\n\nJudge Milian: (Laughs) Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And then, in a split second, boom—impact. Pieces flying everywhere. And the first thought in my head was, I can’t believe this is happening.\n\n[Defendant’s Testimony – Ubaldo Mejia]\nJudge Milian: What happened, sir?\n\nDefendant (Ubaldo Mejia): I was coming, and I made my left turn. If he says there were cars coming from this direction, then when I made my left, they would’ve hit me.\n\nJudge Milian: Maybe you were less cautious than he was?\n\nDefendant: No. I came here, I saw him coming, and I expected him to hold his brakes.\n\nJudge Milian: Why would he have to stop?\n\nDefendant: Because he was at the stop sign.\n\nJudge Milian: But why were you in the path of where he would turn?\n\nDefendant: The street is narrow.

Two weeks later, they sent me tickets.\n\nJudge Milian: What for?\n\nDefendant: Crossing a solid line and failure to maintain lane.\n\nJudge Milian: This police report states:\n\nVehicle 2 (Plaintiff) was stopped at the stop sign.\nVehicle 1 (Defendant) cut the corner and struck Vehicle 2.\nThe officer drew a diagram that matches the plaintiff’s story.\n[Judge’s Ruling]\nJudge Milian: The police report shows you (Defendant) making a weird tight left turn. This suggests you were trying to cut the traffic too fast and miscalculated.\n\nYour insurance company denied the claim?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, State Farm denied it, saying he was not legally liable.\n\nJudge Milian: They’re wrong.

{"id": "291", "dialogue": "\n**Judge:** Miss Johnson, you and your business Retro Girls Hawaiian Ice Shack are suing Miss Hassan and her business, Main Experience. Miss Hassan, you're a hairstylist, and you're counterclaiming for $10,000 for harassment, stalking, defamation, and property damage. Let's hear from you first, Miss Johnson. What is going on?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I moved into my storefront in the fall of 2015 or leased it in 2016. I was there to open up a storefront so that I could help the community. I do a lot of givebacks in the community. I host storytime for children, breast cancer awareness dinners, and I sell ice cream.\n\n**Judge:** So it's a dessert shop, but you do other community outreach as well. Do you also live there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I live upstairs from the storefront. Main Experience is like 10 or 15 feet across from my door.\n\n**Judge:** So are they next door or a couple of stores down?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Next door. Right next door.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. When did the problems start between you two?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The problem started before Miss Hassan moved in, originally with the previous owner of the hair salon in the spring of 2016.\n\n**Judge:** Is that the present owner?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That’s the current owner.\n\n**Judge:** Is she in court today?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, she is not.\n\n**Judge:** All right, so when Miss Hassan moves in, you start not getting along with her next door. Why?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She moved in, and she would be in the storefront until 2 or 3 AM, playing loud music, making noise, cursing, and her children would be outside running around being disruptive. She and her daughter would have fights in and outside the storefront. It was very disruptive to the quiet area we had before.\n\n**Judge:** So then how do we get to a problem with her specifically? Because you're suing her, not the prior owner.\n\n**Plaintiff:** When she moved into the hair salon in December 2017, it wasn’t an issue at first. But when she started living inside the shop, she would come in at 2 or 3 AM, slamming doors, making noise, which woke me up.\n\n**Judge:** Did you call the police?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, very often for noise violations.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have any reports showing the police took action?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The police came and spoke with her. One officer said he would cite her for loud noise.\n\n**Judge:** Were you ever cited for noise violation, Miss Hassan?\n\n**Defendant:** No, I was never cited.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have proof that she was cited, Miss Johnson?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I just heard the officer say he would.\n\n**Judge:** Then what happened next?\n\n**Plaintiff:** We were hosting a Juneteenth celebration in my storefront. A patron of hers parked illegally for six hours in a five-minute parking zone. When the ticket officer arrived, they assumed I had called them. Her patron confronted me, cursing at me.\n\n**Judge:** But you’re suing her, not her patron. Are business owners responsible for their patrons’ actions?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She also put trash in front of my storefront.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have proof of her doing that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have images of her family members putting trash.\n\n**Judge:** But do you have proof of *her* putting trash there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Not directly, but I have a security camera from December 2016.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have video of her putting trash there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have images of her family members doing it.\n\n**Judge:** What about the harassment, stalking, and defamation claims?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have images of her filming my storefront and walking past.\n\n**Judge:** Pick your best video and show me.\n\n**Defendant:** Your Honor, I don’t know where this hostility comes from. When I first moved in and rented a booth in 2016, I noticed Miss Johnson staring at me through the salon window for hours. I asked the salon owner about it, and she said there were already issues with her.\n\n**Judge:** You call yourself a celebrity hairstylist. What does that mean?\n\n**Defendant:** I work with celebrities, have been published in magazines, and have done hair for people on *Housewives* and *Love & Hip Hop*.\n\n**Judge:** Who is the woman sitting with you?\n\n**Defendant:** My mother. She has witnessed much of what has happened.\n\n**Judge:** So what is your side of this?\n\n**Defendant:** I ignore her, but she calls the police on me constantly, stopping me from working. The police never find any loud music.\n\n**Judge:** How often has she called the police on you?\n\n**Defendant:** Countless times. The police advised the salon owner to get a restraining order against her.\n\n**Judge:** Why do you believe you’re entitled to $10,000 from her?\n\n**Defendant:** She’s affected my business. In the past two months, I’ve been filming a reality show at my salon. Because of her police calls on October 25th and November 3rd, I had to move filming to other locations, costing me money.\n\n**Judge:** Miss Johnson, this video of you filming her car—why were you doing that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I saw her leave and come back an hour later. I didn’t understand why, so I recorded it.\n\n**Judge:** Miss Hassan, you’re in your car, and she’s filming you. What do you think?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t know why she does this. It feels like harassment.\n\n**Judge:** Miss Johnson, why are you rolling up on her car and taking video?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I wanted to document what was happening.\n\n**Judge:** Do either of you sleep? According to you, Miss Johnson, you closed your business because of this drama?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, after I was physically assaulted by her and the prior owner’s daughter. I was injured—my wrist and knee. My patrons stopped coming because of the drama.\n\n**Judge:** Did you have them arrested?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The officer didn’t arrest them because Miss Hassan claimed she saw the fight, but video footage showed she wasn’t even there.\n\n**Judge:** You both have stacks of letters from people taking sides. How do you expect me to determine who is at fault?\n\n**Judge:** I believe in open access to the courts, but neither of you has presented clear proof. You have conflicting videos, police reports that led nowhere, and letters from neighbors picking sides. This is not something I can resolve in a court of law. I rule *zero* for you, Miss Johnson, and *zero* for you, Miss Hassan.\n\n**Judge:** I suggest you both move forward and stop this feud. Wouldn’t it be great to focus on your businesses instead? Wipe the slate clean and let it go.\n\n**Defendant:** I’m happy with the ruling and just want peace.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I want peace too. We had peace before she moved in. I hope we can have it again.\n\n**Judge:** Good luck to both of you.

When did you start living there?\n\nPlaintiff: I started living there in August 2016.\n\nJudge: With two roommates, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you lived there until when? When was the last day that your roommates were going to live there?\n\nPlaintiff: The end of August 2018.\n\nJudge: And in fact, before that, was the end of your lease, right? Had you guys informed her that you weren't going to stay living there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You had told her, \"We're out,\" and she got a new tenant, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the new tenant was moving in on September 1st?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So it's very clear that you're supposed to be out. And then what happens? You change your mind and decide you're going to stay?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: How were you going to stay when you had no roommates? What was your plan for paying the rent?\n\nPlaintiff: I was going to find new roommates.\n\nJudge: When do you tell her, \"I'm staying\"?\n\nPlaintiff: A few days before we were supposed to move out.\n\nJudge: When exactly?\n\nPlaintiff: The 29th of August.\n\nJudge: How did you tell her?\n\nPlaintiff: I sent her an email.\n\nJudge: Let me see the email. That’s not the 29th, is it? What date was it?\n\nPlaintiff: I said around... I wasn’t sure.\n\nJudge: It’s the 31st of August. It’s the day you're supposed to be moving out.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: That’s the very day that your roommates are both moving out, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: It’s move-out day. Everybody's moving. That’s the day that you tell her, \"I will not be vacating the premises or giving up the lease. There is no need for a walkthrough as I will not be returning the keys.\"\n\nJudge: What was left behind in the apartment?\n\nDefendant: A beat-up couch. Also, there was so much garbage in front of the house.\n\nJudge: Let me see your pictures. Go ahead, you can give them to me. Who is the gentleman with you?\n\nDefendant: My husband.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. So I see—what is that? What are these pieces of wood?\n\nDefendant: Those are the couch’s wood frame. It’s all falling apart.\n\nJudge: Someone moved the couch?\n\nDefendant: No, it’s in there. It’s in another picture.\n\nJudge: Yeah, it’s like broken. You see the spring on the back?\n\nDefendant: That’s the couch.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that thing was just laying there.

If you weren’t moving out, where’s all your clothes?\n\nPlaintiff: I had some things that I left there, and some things—these pictures are taken on the first, so they were taken after she already removed a lot of my items.\n\nJudge: Hold on one second. I know it’s not illegal. I can talk about it till the cows come home. In fact, I have to in order to know what was already ruled on there. Now, you filed a case where? In Housing Court?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And your allegation there was what?\n\nPlaintiff: That I was illegally locked out.\n\nJudge: And how was that case resolved?\n\nJudge: You had a lawyer. Your lawyer told you, \"Offer her a little money, and let's get this done and over with.\"\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: There was a settlement for $200, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Because she claimed that she did not illegally lock you out, and you said—but there was a settlement. Is it correct that you settled that case for $200?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing because you want half of the rent for the 14 months that you lived there returned to you.\n\nJudge: On the counterclaim for $500, I am also finding zero.

You have a counterclaim against him for $5,000 for pain and suffering and some AC units. Let me hear from you first.\n\nPLAINTIFF: They rented my place out. She told me that she didn’t like rugs. I said, 'I’ll tell you what, if you want to extend the lease, I’d be happy to rip out the rugs.' I was texting her back and forth trying to, like, 'Hey, get a hold of me. I’m reaching out to you again.' And I never got correspondence. Like, 'Hey, yeah, let’s do this.' I kept calling her or texting her, and then that... so it just fizzles.\n\nJUDGE: All right.

And I was not able to rent it out when they left in March.\n\nJUDGE: They left when?\n\nPLAINTIFF: What day in March? They left, uh, March 31st.\n\nJUDGE: And you did not pay? They did not pay March rent?\n\nPLAINTIFF: They said you could use the security because we’re not going to get it back anyways.\n\nJUDGE: Is that accurate? You didn’t pay March rent?\n\nDEFENDANT: That’s accurate.\n\nJUDGE: All right. That’s not what security deposit is for.\n\nDEFENDANT: I know.\n\nJUDGE: Well, there’s some risks involved when you did. So you’re suing now for late fees for March because you feel that you should have been paid March and then the issue of the security deposit would have been litigated, you know, at some other point if you could show damages, correct?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Correct.\n\nJUDGE: Right. Um, when did you re-rent it?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I re-rented it the middle of April.\n\nJUDGE: So your damage in terms of rent would be the two weeks in April that you weren’t getting rent, correct?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Correct.\n\nJUDGE: All right. Now, according to you, you didn’t even break the lease because the place was uninhabitable. Explain that to me.\n\nDEFENDANT: Um, in March—March 1st—we told him that we were moving because my daughter got—has allergies. She had to go for surgery and all this.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, hold on. Slow down. Your daughter has what kind of allergies?\n\nDEFENDANT: Uh, well, she doesn’t have allergies, but she got sick from the mold from the excessive heat in the apartment.\n\nJUDGE: I need some medical proof of what you’re saying.\n\nDEFENDANT: Okay. I have that.\n\nJUDGE: Because there was extensive heat in the apartment?\n\nDEFENDANT: Extensive heat in the apartment. The apartment was over 100° all the time.\n\nJUDGE: Why would you live there if it was over 100°?\n\nDEFENDANT: This is what I’m saying. The thermostat in the apartment was broken.\n\nJUDGE: Right.\n\nDEFENDANT: I have pictures of that thermostat.\n\nJUDGE: Right. Okay. You have some texts where you’re talking to them about the thermostat?\n\nDEFENDANT: Right.\n\nJUDGE: The thermostat is a $30, you know, it’s nothing. It’s solved in an instant. Why would you allow your child to get sick over something that—and I saw the text where he’s—is he texting? Are you texting him or her?\n\nDEFENDANT: Her.\n\nJUDGE: Let me see the copy of texts. I’m going to show it to you where he’s saying, 'Do you need me to change a thermostat?' Hello? Hello? I mean, if you have other texts you want me to see, show it to me. But it’s like, 'Hi Phil, is there a way to control the heat in here? It is way hot in here. Very hard to breathe even.' This is in October. He says, 'Sorry about that. There should be a control knob in the living room where the baseboard register is. Let me know if you can’t control the heat. We will get it fixed.'\n\nDEFENDANT: Right.\n\nJUDGE: So, a week later, 'Hey Marky, does the thermostat work or do we need to get it fixed? Also, I would like to discuss the flooring with you as in replacing the carpet or putting down something new, so when you get a chance, give me a call. We can talk about it.' No response. October 26, 'Hey, reaching out to you again. Give me a call when you can.' No response.\n\nJUDGE: However, you have to prove that the condition was severe enough to render the apartment uninhabitable. A broken thermostat is not enough. You had a responsibility to get it fixed when the plaintiff reached out to you multiple times. Now, let’s address the mold issue.\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. I have medical records showing my daughter’s respiratory issues and a letter from her doctor stating that prolonged exposure to mold could have worsened her condition.\n\nJUDGE: All right. Let me see those.\n\n(Defendant hands documents to the judge.)\n\nJUDGE: Hmm. The doctor’s note is very general. It does not say that the mold in your apartment specifically caused her illness, only that mold exposure can aggravate respiratory conditions. Do you have any inspection reports or evidence that the mold was severe and pervasive?\n\nDEFENDANT: No, Your Honor. I didn’t get an official inspection. But I do have pictures of the mold we found behind the air conditioning units.\n\nJUDGE: (Examines pictures) These show some discoloration, but I don’t see anything that would rise to the level of making the apartment uninhabitable. Did you report this to the landlord at any time before deciding to leave?\n\nDEFENDANT: We mentioned it when we told him we were leaving.\n\nJUDGE: That’s not how it works. If you had an issue, you needed to give the landlord a chance to address it before breaking the lease. Since you didn’t, you are responsible for the unpaid rent and damages.\n\nDEFENDANT: But we were suffering in that place!\n\nJUDGE: I understand, but legally, the burden of proof is on you. Based on the lease terms and lack of sufficient evidence for uninhabitability, I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the unpaid rent. However, I will not award the full amount requested for damages since the plaintiff was able to re-rent the unit fairly quickly.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJUDGE: Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $2,078.

My tenant said she was hearing noise hitting the house. She went outside—she was on her way to work anyway—and all she saw was this big black cloud of smoke. She looked over and saw that they were blowing with some big industrial blower. As she was looking out the side of the house, she saw a neighbor on the other street behind us—whole another street.

It’s like glass block, but they separate into little blocks, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, which I thought maybe they would fix one or two. But the guy who estimated said no, they have to redo the whole thing.\n\nJudge: They’re all cracked?\n\nPlaintiff: There’s one that’s missing, and then all the other ones are cracked.\n\nJudge: How’d that happen?\n\nPlaintiff: The one that’s missing is lying on the ground because whatever happened made it fall over.\n\nJudge: But then what are those pieces of stuff that I see?\n\nPlaintiff: Part of the soot and debris that was on—\n\nJudge: No, no, but there’s also glass that I’m looking at here.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m not sure. That’s just the look.\n\nJudge: Was that cracked before, or are you suggesting that the blowing that day cracked all of it?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m saying that when I came home, the blowing that day caused the glass to be on the ground. It damaged one of the glass blocks.\n\nJudge: When was the last time you had been there?\n\nPlaintiff: I park there every day. That’s the side of the house I park on.\n\nJudge: So you live there as well?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I live upstairs.\n\nJudge: Let’s see what your tenant has to say.\n\n(Audio recording plays)\n\nTenant: On my way to work, I walk outside. There is this big cloud—\n\nJudge: Is she in bed while she’s talking to me?\n\n(Audio continues)\n\nTenant: I peek around the corner, and I see in the parking lot they’re blowing with this big loud machine, blowing debris everywhere, all this trash. As I’m walking out of the driveway, I look and see the glass is broken. I’m assuming maybe some of the debris got on there. I don’t know.\n\nJudge: This is your tenant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What is your theory? That their blower lifted something besides soot that broke your window? Because soot wouldn’t break your window.\n\nPlaintiff: This is my theory. It wasn’t broken before—I park right there every day. I would have noticed.\n\nJudge: Did you see a rock?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you take a picture of something that would be strong enough?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you take a picture of the debris near the window?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: That’s going to be a no. All right, Kevin, how long have you been doing landscaping?\n\nDefendant: We’ve been doing winter services and landscaping for five seasons.\n\nJudge: So you were not physically out there that day?\n\nDefendant: No, but I oversee the work.\n\nJudge: Did you go to the property after hearing about the damage?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: What did you conclude?\n\nDefendant: Our equipment couldn’t have caused the damage.\n\nJudge: How far was your blower from the window?\n\nDefendant: 30 to 40 feet.\n\nJudge: That’s a big distance for a blower to send a rock flying. You have zero evidence, Ms. Smith. My verdict is for the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s okay.

{"id": "537", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please be seated. Thank you, Douglas. All right, Ms. Wagan, you are suing Ms. Pigage for $3,000 that you believe she owes you for malnourishing and abusing your horse. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Back in October of 2015, I entered into a free lease with Dana and her husband. They had come to my house the first week of October to look at our horse. They agreed that they liked it; they wanted to lease it. It was a free lease—no money was involved.\n\nJudge: So you basically leased the horse to them, and they had to take care of the horse for that amount of time, correct? Do you have a written contract with them?\n\nPlaintiff: I do.\n\nJudge: Let me see. Who’s the rider?\n\nPlaintiff: Our daughter—well, my daughter.\n\nJudge: And how old is your daughter?\n\nPlaintiff: Thirteen.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go ahead. What happens?\n\nPlaintiff: In the beginning, I would go over and check on the horse, you know, the first few weeks. I would ride by once a week, and then—\n\nJudge: How far were they from you?\n\nPlaintiff: About eight miles away. So, you know, as time went on, we’d check on them a little less. Then it got to where I’d just go by the house maybe if I was going grocery shopping. And, you know, the first year everything went great. Last July, I had knee surgery, so I hadn’t been by the house for at least a couple of months. I couldn’t drive for six weeks. Then, um, I would say it was the end of August, early September, John had stopped by our house and said they were thinking about not using the horse anymore. That, um, the daughter wasn’t riding much and was thinking about bringing it back. So we had told him, you know, that’s fine. He asked me again if we could pick the horse up, and I said, ‘Well, I still don’t have a trailer to come get him.’ I said, ‘But you can bring him back anytime. We don’t have to be home. You can just put him in the field, and I’ll see them when I go out to feed.’ So, I didn’t hear from them. And then it was January 16th, I went by with a friend because, actually, she had a trailer and said her daughter would be interested in riding. I said, ‘Well, I think these people are done with the horse. If you can get it back to my house, your daughter can come over and ride.’ So we stopped over to look at him, and he was just skin and bones.\n\nJudge: What’s the horse’s name?\n\nPlaintiff: Cowboy Democracy. And he was about 400 pounds underweight. I do have photos. I brought photos of before and after.\n\nJudge: Hold on. Who is riding?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s—that’s me. And you can just see, he’s got a big chest. He’s not a super tall horse but a typical quarter horse, very healthy there.\n\nJudge: What’s that?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s a photo of the empty trash can that John—the night I found the horse and we got him back to our house. Because even though I didn’t have a trailer that was tagged or had registrations, I came home hysterical. My husband put on his shoes and said, ‘Well, go get him.’ He said, ‘I’ll drive slow.’ So we rode over and got him.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait. Who did you talk to about getting him and everything else?\n\nPlaintiff: Nobody. I just saw the condition and just went and got him. He wasn’t staying there.\n\nJudge: Did you know that she was getting the horse?\n\nDefendant: No, I knew nothing.\n\nJudge: And how did you find out?\n\nDefendant: I came home. I had left the house probably around 3:00 that day, went to the mall with my children. I came home probably around 5:00, and when I came home, Cowboy was gone.\n\nJudge: So when did you get the pictures?\n\nDefendant: I got these pictures two days after I had brought the horse home.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t get the pictures until January?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t get them until January.\n\nJudge: Who got them instead of you?\n\nDefendant: Her husband’s lawyer. He sent them to his lawyer—his divorce lawyer—because the night I got the horse—\n\nJudge: Fighting you for custody?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So the premise is, if you can’t take care of a horse, you can’t take care of a kid? How old is the kid you have in common?\n\nDefendant: Six years old.\n\nJudge: But he didn’t send them to her, correct?\n\nDefendant: Well, I don’t know. According to her, she got them and was told in September—\n\nJudge: I’ve seen enough. Based on my calculations, my judgment is in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount of $1,045.

{"id": "8", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. The next case on the docket—the plaintiff says her mechanic screwed up her Mercedes something fierce, with black smoke billowing out of the tailpipe. The defendant says her problem was a burnt-out fuel pump, which had nothing to do with what he fixed. It’s the case of You Failed, Mateo.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Kimberly Holland, you’re suing John’s Auto Body Repair Shop for $999.81, which you say he owes you in tow fees and parts and labor that he charged you because, according to you, he didn’t fix your car.\n\nJudge: You are counterclaiming against her for $400 for a tow, diagnostic fees, and some other parts and labor that you had previously given her. But now she’s mad she sued you, and now you want to get paid?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s talk with you first. Tell me exactly what was wrong with your car that you brought it to him.\n\nPlaintiff: I found out that I had oil in my antifreeze.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: At the time, my car was running perfectly fine. It was just that I was told that the antifreeze can cause further damage and that it can become a larger problem than it was.\n\nJudge: So, you take it to him. Does he look at it himself, or did you have an employee do it?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I looked at it myself.\n\nJudge: And what did you note?\n\nDefendant: When I saw the car come in, there was oil in the antifreeze, but after further testing of the vehicle, I noticed that it was actually trans oil in the antifreeze. That was one of the problems she had on the vehicle.\n\nJudge: And that problem cost her how much to fix?\n\nDefendant: Well, I fixed that problem. But besides that problem, when she first brought the vehicle into the shop, she filled out a work order. On the work order, it said oil in the antifreeze, a slow pickup, the check engine light was on, the fuel gauge wasn’t working, and there was a smell of gas.\n\nJudge: May I see that? Didn’t you just tell me there was nothing wrong with the car when you brought it to him?\n\nPlaintiff: As I was explaining, none of those things were keeping my car from running. My car, in all the years that I had it, had never turned off on me—ever.\n\nJudge: So now what happens? He has the car for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: Altogether, about a week before I picked it up the first time.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so you pick it up, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: The next morning, I go to turn the car on, and it would not turn over. After trying it for like 10 minutes, I finally called the shop. He agreed to send someone to pick the car up. He said he knew a tow truck company that works with them and he’d send them over.\n\nJudge: So he tows the car over. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He tows the car over, and literally about two hours later, I get a call from someone else at the shop. They say, “Oh, the car just turned over for me.” I was able to get the car running, and I asked, “Well, what was the issue?” He said, “I don’t know. It could have been spark plugs. It could have been something. But the car is running, come pick up your car.”\n\nPlaintiff: I get a ride over there, pick up my car, bring it home, and park it. That was a Sunday. Monday, I drove it to work and back. I went to a gas station, turned the car off to get gas. When I went to turn it back on, it wouldn’t start. I then contacted my insurance and got a tow truck to bring it back to the shop. It was there for maybe a day or so before they finally called me back and explained to me that it was something about an O2 sensor. Ultimately, I decided I didn’t want them to do the work any longer.\n\nJudge: So what he told you was that you needed an O2 sensor?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: He didn’t say anything about a fuel pump?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t believe he ever said anything about a fuel pump.\n\nJudge: So you take it to another mechanic, and that mechanic tells you that you have a burnt fuel pump?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. Yes. He actually showed it to me.\n\nJudge: But did they burn your fuel pump, or was it just that you were driving a 2007 Mercedes and things go wrong over time?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand that, but from the time I paid him, the car never worked properly.\n\nJudge: Let’s get to the counterclaim. You’re suing for $400 for diagnosing the car and two tows. But you weren’t initially charging her for that, correct?\n\nDefendant: Yes, your Honor. But I spent hours diagnosing the car, and she sued me.\n\nJudge: But there was no contract for those fees. I’m dismissing your counterclaim.\n\nJudge: As for your claim, Ms. Holland, there is zero evidence that the defendant burned your fuel pump. Judgment in favor of the defendant.

{"id": "548", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant stiffed him on returning his security deposit and his life literally crumbled, but the defendant says the guy moved out in the middle of the night without giving notice. It's the case of \"You Ruined My So-Called Life.\"\nJudge: Thank you. Welcome John Shanesy.\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: You are suing Michael Biancardi, your former landlord for $5,000. You say that you are out substantially more than that as a result of him not returning a security deposit. Okay, you find out about his place how?\nPlaintiff: Craigslist.\nJudge: Craigslist. All right and you moved from where?\nPlaintiff: I had moved back in from Colorado back in the late of 2009.\nJudge: Okay, and how much security deposit did you pay him?\nPlaintiff: $520 plus also a week's rent would be $650.\nJudge: Okay but why are you suing for $657 in security deposit if your security deposit was only 520?\nPlaintiff: The other one, the rest of that was the week's rent.\nJudge: Was a week's rent included into the rental?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: I understand but you lived there that week right? That was your rent?\nPlaintiff: Okay.\nJudge: All right, so I've got it. All right so then what happens? You lived there from 2009 until... Are you living with him?\nPlaintiff: No, I'm not. I moved out on Fe... No, I'm sorry.\nJudge: I mean when you moved in in 2009, are you actually a roommate of his?\nPlaintiff: No, I was living upstairs and in a room.\nJudge: And he's living where?\nPlaintiff: Downstairs.\nJudge: All right but it's... is it one a one family place? What is it?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it's a one family dwelling. It's an entrance into the back of the house and you come in and you walk up a set of stairs and it was two rooms upstairs in the second portion of the house.\nJudge: And so he rented one to you, one to somebody else?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: All right and then what happens?\nPlaintiff: Well basically I was living there for a period of time itself. I had then gotten another opportunity for possibly getting the job. Unfortunately at the time financially wise I couldn't do anything with it so I lost that one particular job but then what ended up happening was Your Honor is September 23rd, 2011, my boss, my ex-boss had committed suicide.\nJudge: Sorry to hear that.\nPlaintiff: Okay, what ended up happening was is that his wife instructed me then at the time that she needed to as far as sell all her vehicles and her buses itself and she would be closing up the business. So we had from the end of September after burying Mr. Matini to the end of the physical year of 2011 to get rid of all of her vehicles, which we did.\nJudge: What does that mean in terms of what were you doing for a living?\nPlaintiff: I was working for her running her business itself as far as bus limousine business.\nJudge: Oh so that happens and now you have no job?\nPlaintiff: At the end of this, at the end of the physical year of 2011, December, the end of December basically I would have no job.\nJudge: All right but just let me ask you a question. At some point you decide that you want to move out. How much notice does the lease, does the agreement require?\nPlaintiff: Three weeks.\nJudge: And you weren't giving him the 3 weeks notice correct?\nPlaintiff: What happened was is that on February 29th there was a Sunday, I had turned around and I had moved out.\nJudge: All right, now what I want to know is you didn't give him notice and you know that you... Let me see what he signed originally. Did you sign something that talked about notice and you know that it says notice so tell me your reason on why it is he can't keep it as a breach?\nPlaintiff: I had spoken with my attorney and my attorney said to me that he directed me to go to as far as the township of Babylon to find out whether or not as far as this dwelling was legal or not. And I found out from the Town of Babylon that it was not legal. He always wanted cash payments for me, never gave me a receipt for any type of rent whatsoever.\nJudge: All right, let me hear your response to that.\nDefendant: He asked if I would take a check. I said no, I don't accept checks, only cash because checks do bounce.\nJudge: Did you think that's what I was asking? I was asking about whether the place is legal, legal to rent out.\nDefendant: Well now I found out that it's not legal.\nJudge: What do you mean now you found out?\nDefendant: I read in a handbook a state law indicating that you're allowed to have a maximum of four borders unrelated. So I assumed that I was doing okay. Now that I got a summons I'm aware that I wasn't allowed to do it.\nJudge: Okay, what are you allowed to do instead?\nDefendant: Nothing.\nJudge: Nothing? Can't you... can't rent?\nJudge: Why won't you return his security deposit if you can't keep it for rent? What happened? You have a counterclaim against for $695, $100 is for cleaning fee. What is it that was unclean when he left?\nDefendant: All right, he left a large TV I couldn't budge it. I had to have someone come in.\nJudge: Why'd you leave a TV behind?\nPlaintiff: I left the TV behind Your Honor because I had no room in my vehicle to take it.\nJudge: Well that's not his problem, that's your problem. Okay, go on.\nDefendant: There were bowling balls that were very heavy I couldn't pick up.\nJudge: Did you leave bowling balls?\nPlaintiff: I think I may have left one in the bill in the couple.\nDefendant: And I had to get someone to come up, straighten the room out and remove all the items.\nJudge: Now according to your lease you're entitled to keep a $100 for that trouble?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: All right, now let me ask you about the other thing. You're claiming against a security deposit is two weeks rent and you can't do that because if it's not legal to rent out, you can't ask me to enforce and help you to get rent that's illegal for you to collect. That's like, you know, he buys cocaine from you and the cocaine's not good quality so you come to court and ask the judge to 'well he ripped me off so I was... I want some of my cocaine money.' But you know when something is illegal we don't allow you to use us as a court system to help you... put your hand down... to help you to get money you're not entitled to get, right?\nJudge: But now let's talk about the cost to repair and paint ceiling. Why is that on your tenant? What happened?\nDefendant: I told him I was very reluctant that he could have an air conditioner and I told him I wanted him to sign a document that if the air conditioner should cause any type of damage whatsoever you could be responsible.\nJudge: Did the air conditioner cause damage?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: What damage?\nDefendant: The ceiling is all stained that it was probably leaking from the air condition.\nJudge: Did you ever bring that to his attention before he moved out?\nDefendant: I didn't know it.\nJudge: How did... when did you find it out?\nDefendant: When he left. The next day I just start looking around and I spotted it. I wasn't aware of it.\nJudge: And you have pictures of it?\nDefendant: Yes, you are.\nJudge: And what room is... is that?\nDefendant: That would be my kitchen.\nJudge: And his bedroom is right over that? Is that where the AC was in his bedroom?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: But how's that $325?\nDefendant: There was one spot they had to cut out and they had to put a piece of...\nJudge: Let me see the proof that you paid $325. How do I know that this is from damage from the AC leaking as opposed to that you just had a pipe issue?\nDefendant: Well there are no pipes in that area and the roof and the siding was done maybe a little over three years ago.\nJudge: What say you about the whole air conditioning thing because you did sign something that said that any... any...\nPlaintiff: I have the pictures here Your Honor of the room itself taken and you'll see the air conditioner was purchased in May of 2011, was a brand new addition. It's in that box right there that I was going to take with me. Unfortunately I had no more room left in my vehicle to take it and that's the pictures of the way I left the place, very clean and spotless. And where you see the TV was the windows where that air conditioner was placed in back in the end of May of 2011 and it was removed in the end of August of 2011, put into... it was put onto a tarp and I made sure that all the water and condensation was out of the air conditioner. I turned around put it back into its original box and sealed in plastic and all put it into the closet. That was the last actual item that I was going to take but I had no more room in my vehicle.\nJudge: Okay, now how do you manage to turn a $520 security deposit case into $5,000? Would you ever find a roommate through Craigslist?\nPlaintiff: Absolutely not.\nJudge: You never know who you're going to meet. I got it. Didn't someone get killed... several... what do you think? Not a chance I would never take a roommate through Craigslist... all single white female. Going inside the courtroom, what happened?\nPlaintiff: What happened was is that when I had gone to the Township of Babylon and I explained to everything that happened, okay, I also said to her that I also lost a job and I do have a letter here from that employer that is telling you that he did offer me a job and then under my financial circumstances that I couldn't take the job because of the security money.\nJudge: Okay but why... why would you not be able to take a job over security not being returned to you? First of all, security doesn't have to be returned to you in the spot, it could be returned to you within 30 days. So why would that have any bearing on whether you take the job? Why don't you just take the job?\nPlaintiff: The situation was Your Honor is I didn't have enough money to travel.\nJudge: That's to travel where? Where was the job?\nPlaintiff: They had a position for me either in Virginia...\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Or in California and I didn't have the funds to travel.\nJudge: Okay, I know but how does that mean he's got to pay you $10,000? I mean I'm sorry that you're going through financial difficulty, these are tough times for a lot of people, it sounds like you're doing what you can, hopefully there will be rosier skies ahead. Okay, but my question to you is how does that mean he has to pay you $110,000? I mean if you if you don't even have the $200 it'll take you to get to the city to get the job that's on him so he has to pay you $10,000 that you can't...\nPlaintiff: I understand what you're saying.\nJudge: You just angry?\nPlaintiff: I'm very distressed of this whole matter.\nJudge: All right, your security deposit is $520 not $657. You're not entitled to $10,000 extra dollars for loss of income because of the job situation. You're entitled to keep the $100 for cleaning based on the testimony I've heard. You're not entitled to deduct anything... now we're done... you're not entitled to deduct anything for rent because you're not entitled to charge rent and I find that you have not adequately proven to me that the whatever repair you had to do was due to the air conditioner. The way that people prove that to me is that here where this is all listed it would say 'leak due to faulty air conditioning' or something. So you... you have to bring me something that proves to me that it's due to the AC and you haven't done that so I'm not going to allow you to deduct anything for the AC. That means that I'm ordering you to return $420. That's the 520 security deposit minus the $100 cleaning fee that you basically admitted you... you had violated that clause. So I find in favor of the plaintiff in this case in the amount of $420 plus prejudgment statutory interest plus your court costs. Okay on your counter claim zero other than the 100 that I'm letting you keep.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "plaing the victim, guilt tripping, exaggeration"}
{"id": "205", "dialogue": "udge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff helped the defendant find two kittens, and the defendant won’t pay the adoption fee. But the defendant says there was never an adoption fee agreement. It’s the case of kitty galore.\n\nBailiff: You're welcome.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mary Chirichella, you are suing Here Kitty Kitty Incorporated, represented here by Leslie Diamond. You’re the president?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, for $180, the amount that you say they owe you as an adoption fee for two kittens, right? That they received and kept rather than giving you the adoption fee?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, so tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, in July of [year], I rescued two tortoiseshell kittens—\n\nJudge: Where did you rescue them from?\n\nPlaintiff: From a street in a busy area.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: They were about 10 to 12 weeks old. It was a location where I’d been doing cat rescue for 12 years. I had been feeding there and had seen the kittens before.\n\nA friend of mine, Eileen, agreed to foster them. I provided the food and litter. Eileen took care of them daily. I created a flyer for Natasha and Nadia, my phone number was on it, and Eileen and I posted it in various locations.\n\nIt was a slow summer. The economic crisis was in full swing, and I wasn’t getting calls I was happy with.\n\nJudge: What kind of donation were you looking for?\n\nPlaintiff: Originally, just to cover my costs.\n\nJudge: How much was that?\n\nPlaintiff: At the time, I would have taken $75 for them.\n\nJudge: For each or both?\n\nPlaintiff: For both. At that point, they had only one vet visit, which cost $131.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: When Eileen took the kittens to the vet, someone there suggested she take them to Petco on Route 3. Miss Diamond’s group, Here Kitty Kitty, showed cats for adoption there on weekends.\n\nJudge: Do you work for Petco?\n\nDefendant: No, but we show our cats there. I’ve been doing rescue for 20 years. Here Kitty Kitty will celebrate its 9th anniversary in September.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: Eileen brought them to Petco and left them with her. Eventually, someone completed an adoption application. I spoke with the adopter and then with Leslie. I asked, \"What is the adoption fee?\" She said, \"$180.\"\n\nI told her I would need that fee to cover my costs. She asked how much I had spent. I said a few hundred dollars. She said, \"I can’t give you that.\" I replied, \"I don’t expect you to, but I will need the adoption fee.\"\n\nDefendant: Nobody talked about an adoption fee before this.\n\nJudge: Is that true?\n\nDefendant: Mary knew our adoption fee. Because the adopters were in their 60s, we have a program sponsored by Purina that covers the adoption fee.\n\nMary only brought up the adoption fee after the adoption. In all my years doing this, I sometimes split the fee with someone or write a tax letter.\n\nJudge: So the cats were adopted, and then what?\n\nPlaintiff: Leslie agreed to mail me the adoption fee but said I’d have to wait for the money from Purina. I said that was fine. A few months went by, and I started to suspect something was wrong.\n\nI called her, but she didn’t return my calls. One night, I spoke to her husband, and he said she’d get back to me. Eventually, I went to see her in person.\n\nJudge: Why were you avoiding her?\n\nDefendant: I took all her calls. The one night she called, I was very sick, and my husband picked up the phone.\n\nJudge: According to you, how many messages did you leave?\n\nPlaintiff: Three.\n\nJudge: So you went to Petco in person?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. As soon as I arrived, Leslie said, \"I don’t have your money.\"\n\nI asked why. She said, \"I had a couple of veterinary emergencies, and I had to use it.\"\n\nI asked when she would have it.

You didn’t set a price, so I have to set one. I’m going to split it. I order you to pay her $90.\n\nFor the future, if you’re in this situation, specify the money part upfront.

{"id": "274", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Brenda Nelson. She says she went to the defendant's business to get her rim repaired because she hit a snowbank and cracked it. When she got the car back, she noticed the defendant switched tires on her. That's right, he put a different tire on her car, which doesn't match with the other three originals. He can't find the matching tire and has offered to sell her one at a 50% discount, which is ludicrous. And she's suing him for the $263.183 she's now owed.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Richard Jones. He says the cracked rim put a hole in the plaintiff's tire, and he had to replace it because it wouldn't hold air. He found a tire and put it on the car as a courtesy. He didn't charge her for it. Now the woman's suing him because she doesn't like that it's not the same brand. Come on, lady. He's happy to match her tire for her, but she needs to pay for it. He's accused of being flat with a customer.\n\nJudge: All parties, please rise. Case.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says a snowbank ruined the rim. She took it to the defendant, who put on a wonky tire. But the defendant says he went above and beyond. It’s the case of sick and tire.\n\nJudge: Brenda and Julius Nelson, represented here by Brenda, yes?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. You are suing RV Pit Stop LLC, represented here by its owner, Richard Jones, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. For $263.183, the cost to buy a new Firestone tire that, according to you, he lost, I guess. All right, so let’s hear it. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I was losing air on the right tire, so I—I had never been to the gentleman’s shop before, so I went there.\n\nJudge: Did you know why you were losing air?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I just would put air in it every so often. And so I went to his shop.\n\nJudge: But you had previously hit a snowbank?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: The air was coming out of the tire?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. And so I took it—I said, maybe I ran over something, your honor.\n\nJudge: After the snowbank?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, after the snowbank, after that. So I took it to him, and so when he pulled the tire, he called me into the room, and he said that the rim was cracked on the inside of the tire. He showed me a crack. He said he had to send it out to be welded.\n\nJudge: All right. Did he say anything about you needing a new actual tire?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma’am. He just said the rim needed a repair, and it was going to be only—how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $80.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: He charged me $80, and he had to send it out.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I came back that Monday. The first time I came back, the rim wasn’t back, so I came back later that day. The rim—the guy was bringing the rim in, so as they were putting the tire on, I got out of the car, and I looked, and I told him, “That’s not my tire.”\n\nJudge: How did you know it wasn’t yours?\n\nPlaintiff: Because, your honor, I just put the car—I haven’t had the car a year. It’ll be a year next month, the 19th. So—and plus, I just had it—you know, the wheels aligned. So I knew all my tires, and I clean my own car myself, so I knew my car.\n\nJudge: But what made you look at it and realize it wasn’t your tire?\n\nPlaintiff: As soon as he put the tire on, I said, “That’s a Uniroyal. I have Firestones.”\n\nJudge: Okay, because you saw that it was a Uniroyal, and you knew you had four Firestones?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. And when you said that to him, what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He started telling his coworkers to look around, and they didn’t know what happened to the tire or anything. So I asked them, “What are you going to do?” He said, “If you pay half, I’ll pay half.” I said, “Sir, nothing was wrong with my tire. It was just the rim that was supposed to be repaired.” But he gave me another tire.\n\nPlaintiff: So I took the car to Mavis to find out what the price of the tire would be, and the lady—she gave me a printout. Very nice. She came out and looked at the tire. She said the, um—well, that’s hearsay, but she wrote everything down for me.\n\nJudge: Do you have that with you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Go ahead and give me what you’ve got here for me to see.\n\nJudge: Mr. Jones, can you tell me what happened?\n\nDefendant: Uh, yeah, I can tell you what happened.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: Uh, the customer had a cracked rim. I had to send it out to the fabricator to fix the rim.\n\nJudge: Do you send it away with the tire on it, or do you separate it?\n\nDefendant: No, I separate it.\n\nJudge: Who separates it? You or someone else?\n\nDefendant: My technician.\n\nJudge: And then what do you do with the tire?\n\nDefendant: Put it to the side.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: When the rim is ready, we put the tire back on. We test it. Once we tested it, I later found out from my technician it had a hole in the side. I have a guy that cleans up, so he discarded all the bad tires. So, without telling her, I gave her a tire on my own. No extra cost.\n\nJudge: You know how that’s always happening where the tire store just gives you a tire on their own, no extra cost?\n\nJudge: Rare. Very rare.\n\nJudge: Yeah, who does that?\n\nJudge: So when you take your car in for a new tire, does it have to be the same brand as the other three?\n\nAudience Member: I think so. You should have the same brand.\n\nJudge: What do you say?\n\nAudience Member: I think if you’re driving a sports car and you really care about the look, maybe. But if you’re rolling around in a minivan, probably doesn’t matter too much.\n\nJudge: Would anybody notice that it’s Goodyear versus Firestone or whatever?\n\nAudience Member: Probably, yes.\n\nJudge: Really? Okay. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nJudge: I have yet to meet anyone who finds out that some stranger needs a tire and gives it to her. It sounds like you were hoping that the lady wouldn’t notice that it was a Uniroyal and that she had four Firestones. Sounds like she knew her car—certainly her tires. It’s kind of weird. Don’t you think it’s weird?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it was my fault, your honor, for not explaining to her that if she hit a pothole after she bent and cracked the rim, nine times out of 10, the tire was going to be no good.\n\nJudge: Is it your fault because you forgot to explain that to her, or is it that it’s not nine times out of 10 that the tire is no good?\n\nJudge: Miss Nelson, I’m going to find in your favor in the amount of $263.183.

{"id": "449", "dialogue": "Bailiff: All parties, please rise.\n\nJudge Milian: Welcome back to The People's Court. The plaintiff hired the defendant to fix his car but wanted to watch so he wouldn’t get ripped off. The defendant says he doesn’t give refunds but was ready to do the job. It’s the case of Your Real Dipstick.\n\nJudge Milian: Michael Evans Sr., you are suing Demetrius Callaway for $1,000. That includes $200 you paid him and $800 for inconveniencing you and threatening you. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Evans Sr.): I contacted him in October about fixing my car.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: But I didn’t get the money to pay him until December.\n\nJudge Milian: So you finally got the money in December. What needed to be fixed?\n\nPlaintiff: I needed camshaft sensors, my power steering pump replaced, and my dipstick holder for the transmission.\n\nJudge Milian: Alright.\n\nPlaintiff: So he told me how much he would charge me—$200. He came over, looked at the car, and I gave him the money.\n\nJudge Milian: Do you deny receiving the $200?\n\nDefendant (Demetrius Callaway): Not at all.\n\nJudge Milian: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: When we texted, he claimed I had no proof I gave him the money.\n\nJudge Milian: (Reviewing) I’ll see that in a moment, but continue.\n\nPlaintiff: So we set up a date—January 3rd—for the repairs. On that day, I texted him to confirm, and he said he was still pricing the parts. When I called him back, I told him I found the parts cheaper than what he was quoting.\n\nJudge Milian: By how much?\n\nPlaintiff: He found a fuel pump for $195. I found it for $127. He also quoted the camshaft sensors for $88, and I found them even cheaper.\n\nDefendant: He’s just trying to save himself some money.\n\nJudge Milian: He has every right to do that.\n\nPlaintiff: So I told him I would be buying the parts myself. Then he tells me the parts won’t be in until 2:00 PM. He said that was too late and that he wouldn’t be able to do the work until Saturday.\n\nJudge Milian: (Confirming) This was on January 3rd, a Thursday?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge Milian: That doesn’t sound unreasonable. So what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff: I had a job interview on Friday, and because my car wasn’t fixed, I couldn’t get there.\n\nJudge Milian: Did you try public transportation?\n\nPlaintiff: Cleveland’s public transportation is terrible.\n\nJudge Milian: People use it.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, but I’ve had bad experiences with the bus drivers.\n\nJudge Milian: But you could have made it to the interview.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, on Saturday, I told him that wouldn’t work and asked for my money back.\n\nJudge Milian: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said he didn’t have the money.\n\nJudge Milian: Demetrius, what’s your version?\n\nDefendant: I never refused to do the work. His schedule just didn’t match mine. He asked for a refund, but I told him I didn’t have the money at that time.\n\nJudge Milian: So why did you spend the money? That was a deposit for future labor.\n\nDefendant: It was right after Christmas. I spent the money on my kids.\n\nJudge Milian: That’s not the plaintiff’s problem.\n\nDefendant: I told him I’d do the work, but he wanted the money back immediately.\n\nPlaintiff: He kept changing his story. First, he said he had no work. Then he said he had too much work.\n\nJudge Milian: Let me see the text messages.\n\n(Both parties hand over their texts.)\n\nJudge Milian: (Reading) \"That’s kind of late. I have other cars to work on.\" Plaintiff responds, \"So when will you be able to do it?\" Defendant replies, \"Not till Saturday.\"\n\nJudge Milian: Was the work ever done?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I had to borrow money and take my van elsewhere.\n\nJudge Milian: But that was after January 5th. Why not just let him do it on Saturday?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I paid for a specific service on a specific date.\n\nJudge Milian: (Reading more texts) \"I definitely would want to watch the work get done.\" And you respond, Demetrius, \"I don’t do supervision.\"\n\nJudge Milian: You both are acting like a couple of peacocks, strutting around trying to prove who’s in charge. This is so unnecessary.\n\nDefendant: If he sat and watched me, he wouldn’t even know what he was looking at!\n\nJudge Milian: I get that, but why didn’t either of you just find a reasonable solution? This entire situation is ridiculous.\n\n[Verdict]\nJudge Milian: Demetrius, you took a deposit for labor. When the job didn’t happen, the money should have been refunded. That’s on you. I am ordering you to return the $200.\n\nPlaintiff: What about the $800 for inconvenience?\n\nJudge Milian: Absolutely not. You don’t get paid for inconveniences caused by your own decisions.

{"id": "207", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the case of Kim Tapali Lopez versus Michelle Stika. Ms. Lopez, you are suing Ms. Stika for $1,045 in vet bills for your dog, which you claim was injured due to her dog. Please explain what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: On the afternoon of January 22nd, I was in my backyard with my dog, letting him do his business. We were playing with a ball when suddenly, Ms. Stika's dog started barking at the fence.\n\nJudge: What kind of fence is it?\n\nPlaintiff: It's a white PVC fence.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: When her dog started barking, my dog ran over there. I always try to be cautious because there have been issues in the past.\n\nJudge: What kind of issues?\n\nPlaintiff: Her dog has dug holes under the fence multiple times. It's been a repeated problem.\n\nJudge: Okay, continue.\n\nPlaintiff: I told my dog to get away from the fence, but as he ran over, I saw a snout come under the fence, and suddenly my dog yelped and jumped back. He ran to me, and I saw blood pouring from his paw. I grabbed him, but there was so much blood I couldn't see the wound clearly.\n\nJudge: What did you do next?\n\nPlaintiff: I ran to Ms. Stika's house and knocked on the door. Her grandson answered, and I told him what had happened. He said it was probably Diesel, because their other dog, Dutch, was inside the house. He went to get his sister-in-law, and then I went back home to tend to my dog.\n\nJudge: Did your dog continue to bleed?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I am an EMT, so I was able to control the bleeding. About ten minutes later, her daughter-in-law came over to see what had happened. She saw the wound and how bad it was.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of the wound?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I submitted them into evidence.\n\nJudge: What treatment did your dog require?\n\nPlaintiff: He had to be put under anesthesia for a laceration that was about an inch long and went down to the bone. He needed sutures.\n\nJudge: Do you have the vet bill?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I submitted it as well.\n\nJudge: Do you also have the vet report?\n\nPlaintiff: I believe so, here it is.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Ms. Stika, were you there when this happened?\n\nDefendant: No, I was not.\n\nJudge: Then who can provide testimony for you?\n\nDefendant: I have letters from my daughter-in-law and grandson, but they were not there when it happened.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of the holes in the fence?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because they fix them frequently. This has been a continuous issue.\n\nJudge: Ms. Stika, do you have pictures?\n\nDefendant: No, but I can tell you that both dogs dig. It’s an ongoing problem.\n\nJudge: If a dog digs under the fence and another dog gets injured, is the dog owner responsible? What do you say?\n\nDefendant: I think the dog that dug the hole is responsible.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant: Because that dog created the situation by digging the hole.\n\nJudge: But the other dog still bit the dog, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but the first dog shouldn't have gone near the hole.\n\nJudge: The law considers provocation and whether the bite was avoidable. Let's continue. Ms. Stika, do you admit that your side has had issues with digging?\n\nDefendant: We have put cinder blocks along the fence to stop digging.\n\nJudge: That means you acknowledge the problem exists. Is it possible that the dog dug somewhere else?\n\nDefendant: It depends on how much the dog digs.\n\nJudge: Was there originally a gap under the fence?\n\nDefendant: No, but the dogs dig, and gaps appear over time.\n\nJudge: Mr. Stika, you seem to be the one fixing the fence. Please stand and testify.\n\nMr. Stika: I am constantly covering holes and fixing the fence because the dogs keep digging.\n\nJudge: Have any of your other neighbors had issues with your dogs digging?\n\nDefendant: No, our neighbor on the other side has never had any problems.\n\nJudge: Do you have a statement from that neighbor?\n\nDefendant: Yes, here it is.\n\nJudge: Ms. Stika, your grandson wrote in his letter that when he checked the fence, there were no holes. How is that possible if the injury happened?\n\nDefendant: He didn’t take pictures, but we believe the fence was secure.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t add up. Something happened that caused this injury. Have you done anything to prevent this from happening again?\n\nDefendant: I don’t think it’s my responsibility since my dog didn’t dig.\n\nJudge: You could install chicken wire. It’s inexpensive and would solve the problem.\n\nDefendant: I don’t have the time.\n\nJudge: You can take one day off and do it. If this problem is ongoing, you need to take responsibility for preventing future incidents.\n\nDefendant: We’ll put chicken wire down.\n\nJudge: Good. Now, regarding this case, I find Ms. Stika responsible. You are ordered to pay $1,045 for the vet bill.

Next case on the docket: the plaintiff hired the defendant to install a chimney, and it's in total violation of the building code. But the defendant says it was the plaintiff's job to get the proper permits. It’s the case of Chimney Jump. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Mr. Gonzalez, you are suing Rambali Incorporated, represented here by Mr. Naron Rambali, for $4,999. This amount includes the fines you had to pay to the city, architectural fees, permitting fees, and a little extra for aggravation. As it turns out, the work he did for you required a permit. How did you meet Mr. Rambali? How did you first learn about him and what he does?\n\nPlaintiff: Four years ago, I went through a magic service referral online.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And I was given three chimney specialists with licenses.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you found him to do the chimney. Do you have the paperwork from the original transaction with him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: May I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so the scope of the work was: chimney rebuilt from the roof up, obstruction removed, smoke pipes installed, for $2,500.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Was there any permitting involved?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you know that you needed a permit to do this kind of work?\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Did the two of you discuss that?\n\nPlaintiff: I believe I asked, \"Do I need a permit for this?\" and the answer was no.\n\nJudge: So what happens? How does this all come to light? Because if you didn't get caught while it was getting done—why would you think that you don’t need a permit for such a thing? I mean, of course, you need a permit. A simple call to the county or the city would have told you that. But alright, if you didn’t get caught when it was being done, how does it happen five years later?\n\nPlaintiff: I just walked up, came home from work back in April this year, and there was a notice taped to my front gate. A notice of violation and hearing date.\n\nJudge: Can I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So do you contact him and say, \"Hey, what’s going on?\"\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He says I have to contact my architect. He basically said he’d get back to me. I started looking for architects and spoke to four of them, trying to get a ballpark figure on the cost.\n\nJudge: Because now the city is making you—\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I'm trying to work with the city.\n\nJudge: What city is this?\n\nPlaintiff: Queens.\n\nJudge: Okay. So now the city is making you retroactively get architectural plans and prove that it’s in compliance and everything else?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Well, the violation gives you a cure date, and a week after that, there’s a hearing date with the Environmental Control Board. They assess their own fines, which can be $2,500. If you satisfy the cure date, then that part of the penalty gets removed.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you’re out the architect fees, which are four grand, the permitting fees, and the fine. But all these are fees you would have had to pay if you had done it right the first time. Right? Because in New York City, you pretty much know you need a permit for this kind of thing. So the only thing you’re really out is that fine of $520.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I’m still at a loss, though, because I don’t see how they came up with this four years later. What’s going on?\n\nDefendant: As far as I understand, he reported his neighbor. His neighbor did some work in his building next to his house, and he reported his neighbor to the Department of Buildings. The neighbor reported him back.\n\nJudge: So the neighbor reported him?\n\nDefendant: That event happened three years ago.\n\nJudge: And you know about that?\n\nDefendant: I introduced him to an architect. The architect spoke to him, and he told the architect that this happened because he reported his neighbor, so his neighbor reported him back.\n\nJudge: Well, that’ll teach you. Talk about throwing stones in glass houses. So whose job is it to get the proper permits—the contractor or the homeowner?\n\nPlaintiff: The contractor. I think it’s what he does every day, and he knows what to do.\n\nJudge: What do you think?\n\nDefendant: He doesn’t speak English.\n\nJudge: What do you think?\n\nDefendant: I think it’s the contractor. He knows where to go and who to see, and he can do it a lot quicker.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom. The issue is quality of life. He was building a staircase next to my house to go to the third floor, and he had basically turned a two-family home into a hotel SRO. Obviously, I was not happy with that.\n\nJudge: Did you guys talk about permitting at the time?\n\nDefendant: Yes, we did, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And what was the discussion?\n\nDefendant: I told him any changes to the building required a permit.\n\nJudge: Bottom line: if it had been done right, you would have been paying, not him.

Yes, and what price do you two agree upon?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, the price was a set price for everything. That's for the laptop, the work, the labor, the software—$350 flat. I rounded it all off to just one simple number to make it easier.\n\nJudge: So the laptop would have been $150 and the work about $200?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright, so you rounded it off to $350, and you told them, \"Listen, your computer’s shot, and I’ve got an old computer around?\"\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he chose from several different laptops. He then called his daughter. They discussed it. She said fine. Whatever. I’m assuming he said, \"Well, I’m going to bring this one home to let you see.\" She said, \"Okay, fine.\"\n\nJudge: You discussed what you were going to do. He wanted you to extract the data and then put it into the other laptop?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I had to go through an extreme process to extract the data because the initial laptop didn’t work. You can’t boot it up to see anything, so I had to find another way to extract the data.\n\nJudge: How do you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: I hook it up to my external computer, and then I go through the process with my software. What it does is it goes into the BIOS and reads the data. In the business I’m in, you must tell them that all data will not be extracted. We’re not responsible for lost data, so if you have corrupted files, it won’t bring it out. At that time, you can just transfer it from there to whatever piece of hardware you want.\n\nJudge: Fascinating, isn’t it? You see your life flash before your eyes. Every picture you ever took of your kid is gone, and then someone is able to go like this and bring it back. Alright, so what goes wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, after I extracted all the stuff and I brought it to him, I said, \"Here, open it up.\" I showed him all his daughter’s data: pictures, music, tax papers, everything from years and years, from her time at the University of Phoenix. All her classwork and everything. \"Just click on it. You can now open it up.\"\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"Oh, okay. Well, I don’t know if she’s able to use this. She might have a problem with it.\" I said, \"Okay, well, today is Friday. Take the laptop home. Let your daughter use it for the weekend. If everything is fine, you can bring me the money on Monday when we come back to work.\" He said, \"You’re going to trust me?\" I said, \"Hey, I know where you work. We work at the same place, so go on.\"\n\nJudge: Alright, so he takes the laptop and leaves.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I wait. I don’t say anything. I give it time to marinate, let things go through and see what happens. The next week comes, and I see him on Tuesday. I say, \"Yo, what’s going on?\" He says, \"Oh, she’s supposed to be texting me. Call me back around 11:00 tonight. I should have an answer.\" So I call. I never get an answer. Now we’re into our second week, and we’re going into the third week.\n\nJudge: Okay, but I don’t have a bunch of weeks to go through. What’s the problem?\n\nPlaintiff: Because you guys haven’t paid, so I want to know what the problem is.\n\nDefendant: Once we got the laptop, the keys were sticking. The battery would die immediately. The laptop wasn’t working properly. One of the requirements we had for the new laptop was for her data to be there, and it had to be compatible with her schooling at the University of Phoenix.\n\nJudge: What do you mean compatible?\n\nDefendant: Some of the programs you need to download from the University of Phoenix require certain software, like Adobe or Java. She couldn’t download it. We just needed the laptop to work for her schoolwork.\n\nJudge: So it didn’t work as required?\n\nDefendant: No, it didn’t work. And when I tried to do the schoolwork, I wasn’t able to. Some of the files weren’t there when I turned the laptop on.\n\nJudge: Were your pictures there?\n\nDefendant: Not all of them.\n\nJudge: How many thousands were there that you otherwise wouldn’t have had?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know how many I had on there, but I know that…\n\nJudge: Why would that justify not paying at all? You got the information back, even if the computer’s broken.\n\nDefendant: I never spoke to him about paying for anything. I told Curtis, \"Please handle this for me.\"\n\nJudge: How many weeks did it take for you to get the laptop back?\n\nDefendant: About two or three weeks.\n\nPlaintiff: And it got to the point where people from your company came to me and were like, \"What happened?\"\n\nDefendant: Exactly. People are walking up to me, saying, \"Hey, I need a computer.\"\n\nPlaintiff: I mean, it got to the point where I became very humiliated.\n\nJudge: So why did you pay zero for the retrieval?\n\nDefendant: Well, we actually told Curtis we wanted to give the laptop to another company to get her data transferred, and we were going to buy a new one. We were sorry.\n\nPlaintiff: But you didn’t pay the $50 for the transfer of the files.\n\nDefendant: No. I paid someone $50 to just copy the files.\n\nJudge: And yet you don’t want to pay me for extracting the data from a broken laptop, which actually took some talent.\n\nDefendant: It’s inexplicable.\n\nPlaintiff: I did the work. I got your daughter’s data back.\n\nDefendant: We had a different company transfer the files. I had to pay $50 for that.\n\nJudge: Now you are upset and have a counterclaim against him. What’s that about?\n\nDefendant: I want my original broken laptop back.\n\nJudge: Did you not tell him you didn’t need the broken laptop anymore?\n\nDefendant: No. He didn’t want it. He said it was junk. I could keep it.\n\nPlaintiff: Right. I fixed it because he said he didn’t want it. It was of no use to me, so I kept it.\n\nDefendant: You didn’t give it back!\n\nJudge: Okay. I’m finding it a little hard to believe he agreed to $50 for this work when you paid someone $50 to just copy files.\n\nPlaintiff: He has no proof of that.\n\nJudge: I’m ordering them to pay you for extracting the files you successfully retrieved and for the software that was used. For your services, I’ll award you $125. As for your counterclaim, I find it baseless. I dismiss it.\n\nJudge: This case is adjourned.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization, Playing the victim role, Persuasion, Guilt tripping"}

{"id": "915", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Be seated. Come to order, please. Plaintiffs have been sworn. Thank you, Douglas. Angelique Taylor and Jasmine Taylor, you're suing Amanda Camo and Harold Camo Jr. for $625. Why are you sitting down relaxing and leaving? Get up there and stand. You're being sued. It's not like you're a witness. All right. You're suing them for $625—a deposit that you placed on a car, and you were never able to get the car. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Okay, so my daughter got her license—\n\nJudge: And how old are you?\n\nPlaintiff (Jasmine Taylor): 17.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): She was excited about getting her first car, so she did the process of looking up a car. She found a car that she was interested in on Letgo.\n\nJudge: On the website Letgo or the app?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Yes, the app Letgo. The defendant was listing the car for $1,625. So my daughter was interested. They had text messages back and forth about the car. We were supposed to go meet the defendant on November 12 to make arrangements to look at the car to see if my daughter liked it. If she liked it, we would leave a deposit on the car for them to take the car off Letgo as sold. So, on November 12, my daughter and I made arrangements with the defendants to go see the car.\n\nJudge: Which defendant did you make arrangements with—the man or the woman?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): My daughter made the arrangements—\n\nJudge: Who did you talk to? The man or the woman?\n\nPlaintiff (Jasmine Taylor): The man.\n\nJudge: Now, you two—your relationship is what?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Sister and brother.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): We were supposed to meet them on the 12th around 9:00 in the morning to go see the car. My daughter and I proceeded to go to the location, the house at the address they gave us, to see the car. So Harold proceeded to write up a contract for my daughter and Amanda.\n\nJudge: For your daughter and Amanda? Whose car is it?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Harold listed the car as his sister's, but he was representing his sister as a salesperson.\n\nJudge: Who is the registered owner of that car?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): My baby's father.\n\nJudge: But it's your car?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): Well, no, it's—it's not. The registered owner is my baby's father, so it's not my car if I'm not the title owner.\n\nJudge: Unless he signed it over to you?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): To be honest with you, we were in the process of doing that. But I have three kids, and the car was no longer useful for me. I can't fit three car seats. So we didn't even get that far. I got to drive the car for only a few months.\n\nJudge: Are you with him or not with him?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): I am.\n\nJudge: You are with him?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): Yes, I am.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go ahead. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): So he proceeded to write up a contract for my daughter and Amanda.\n\nJudge: Did both of them sign it?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Yes, they did.\n\nJudge: Does anybody have a copy of it?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): I do.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): We proceeded to leave the $625 deposit.\n\nJudge: All right. So the arrangement is that you left $625 as a deposit. The car is sold, then there will be two additional payments of $500 each. The car is being sold as-is. November 26 is a $500 payment, and it just says \"10th,\" but I presume that's December 10th?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, as of December 10th, the car will be paid in full. Hooray! I've got my first car. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): My daughter was very excited that she was going to get her car. She called her grandmother to let her grandmother know about the arrangements for the car. Her grandmother decided that she would give us the remaining $1,000 to pay off the car so that my daughter could receive the car sooner than planned. That same day, I proceeded and I called Harold and I let him know. I said, \"Listen, my daughter's grandmother decided to give us the rest of the remaining money, and we would like to get the car sooner than what was arranged.\" So we agreed that we would give them the two weeks until the next payment was due, which was November 26th.\n\nJudge: So what happened on the 26th?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): I texted Harold at 9:17 AM and said, \"Good morning, just wanted to make sure all's good to pick up the car on Monday. I hope you had a happy Thanksgiving.\" No answer. On the 26th, I tried texting again to make sure that everything was okay with the arrangements. Nothing—no response.\n\nJudge: So you never hear from them again?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): I didn't hear from him again until later that day when he texted me and said, \"I will call you around 7:00 PM, I promise.\"\n\nJudge: And did he?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): No.\n\nJudge: So what did you do next?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelique Taylor): I kept reaching out. No response. At that point, we realized we were not getting the car. I asked for a refund. They refused.\n\nJudge: Amanda, why didn't you return the money?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): They backed out of the deal. We held the car for weeks. That deposit was to secure it.\n\nJudge: But they tried to pay in full early. Why didn't you deliver the car then?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): There were complications with the title transfer.\n\nJudge: So you couldn’t legally sell the car at that point?\n\nDefendant (Amanda Camo): Not yet.\n\nJudge: Then you owe them the money.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting"}
{"id": "200", "dialogue": "Judge: Ms. Moritz, Mr. Wilkinson has been a kind of handyman for you throughout many years. You say that you requested from him this time to come and do some work on a rental cottage that you own, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. And you had a certain amount to spend, so it had to be within that budget?\n\nPlaintiff: That's correct, yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So tell me what issues you had in the rental cottage this time.\n\nPlaintiff: There were two things. One was a chimney repair, and one was a window replacement.\n\nJudge: And what kind of repair did the chimney need?\n\nPlaintiff: As it turned out, it needed a repair to the concrete cap on top of the chimney, and then there would be a metal rain cap or whatever on top of that.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what work did you do? Because at some point, you hired him in August, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then you got sick right after that?\n\nDefendant: Actually, it goes just a few months before that. In February, I got diagnosed with a kidney problem. They had to take the kidney, and I recovered from that within a month. And I was back on the job doing an annex to the property that she rents.\n\nJudge: Okay, but did something happen with your health that delayed this job? Because she didn’t ask for her money back until four months later.\n\nDefendant: Well, in September, they had me back in for tests, and they had to take a bladder and a prostate and a few other parts.\n\nJudge: Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. How are you doing now?\n\nDefendant: I’m fine. You know, this thing on my head is surgery for skin cancer, so I think they got it all this time. But it has nothing to do with our relationship.\n\nJudge: I understand. But that’s what caused her to say, Can I have my money back? It’s been four months.\n\nDefendant: And I totally understand. Except I did spend some time and resources preliminary to all of this. And when I finally did recover from that, I brought the window to get that going, and she decided she didn’t want the window anymore.\n\nJudge: When did you order the window?\n\nDefendant: Well, the window wasn’t delivered until October.\n\nJudge: That wasn’t my question. When did you order it?\n\nDefendant: September.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof that you ordered it in September?\n\nDefendant: Just a conversation with the special order guy. I don’t have a piece of paper.\n\nJudge: All right. It becomes relevant because she’s upset because she says that she called you on what day?\n\nPlaintiff: I called the first week in October. I did not note that in my calendar. And I called again a second time, and I did note that in my calendar as part of my portfolio of evidence.\n\nJudge: Right. You know what’s a much better thing to do? Either text or email so that there’s actually a record of when the call happened.\n\nDefendant: I don’t do either.\n\nJudge: I know. God bless.\n\nDefendant: Sorry.\n\nJudge: No, no. I’m so jealous. Totally jealous.\n\nPlaintiff: Anyway, when he came on the 1st of November with the window after I had called and I had not heard back from him, I said, But John, I canceled the window.\n\nDefendant: He said, Oh, you can’t cancel the window. This is a special order. They don’t let you.\n\nJudge: Let me see what you do have from the window company.\n\nPlaintiff: I believe that says October 13th.\n\nJudge: And I called the day before.\n\nDefendant: Prove that.\n\nJudge: And you can’t prove it.\n\nPlaintiff: I know.\n\nJudge: Because otherwise, people could always say that, right? It’s a he-said-she-said situation.\n\nJudge: Did you ever get a call from her where she was canceling the window?\n\nDefendant: Not that I recall, but I was laid up at the time, and my daughters were supposed to be answering my calls for me.\n\nJudge: All right. So you had originally asked for your $700 back because, from your perspective, he’s done nothing, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And he said at that time, I will pay you back the $700.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So that’s what was happening. And then what happened? Why didn’t you pay her back the $700?\n\nDefendant: Okay. I originally said I’d pay back $300, not thinking about the fact that I’d already invested a significant amount of time.\n\nJudge: What did you invest a significant amount of time doing that has a value to her?\n\nDefendant: Okay. I’m not here to ask for $700 to keep. She is entitled to some money. My problem is I can’t do anything about the window. I’d hate to have to eat the window.\n\nJudge: No, you’re not going to eat the window.\n\nDefendant: And I’d hate to have to lose my ladder, which is being held hostage.\n\nJudge: Where is his ladder, and how is it being held hostage?\n\nDefendant: Well, I have to pay her before I can get the ladder back.\n\nJudge: Is that what she told you?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you say that to him?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t say that. In the letter I wrote to him—\n\nJudge: Did you say anything that sounded like that?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t, I don’t, I don’t—\n\nJudge: If you ever want to see your ladder alive again, you better pay me my money?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t say anything like that.\n\nJudge: She doesn’t strike me as that type of person, I gotta tell you.\n\nDefendant: But if I went to pick up the ladder, I was convinced that I was going to hear about giving all this money back.\n\nJudge: The issue then is: What work did you do that entitles you to keep $700 or any portion of it?\n\nDefendant: I climbed up on the roof, filled in holes with foam so squirrels and bats wouldn’t eat through them. I fixed a short in the light, and I sealed the chimney.\n\nJudge: I’ve heard enough. You can’t prove you canceled the window in time. So the window is yours.\n\nFor the few odds and ends that he did, he’s entitled to keep something, but not $700.\n\nI am ordering him to return to you $600.

{"id": "364", "dialogue": "JUDGE: This is the plaintiff Ena Puit. She says she moved out of an apartment she'd been renting from the defendants for close to four years, did a walkthrough with them, and is now having a devil of a time collecting all of her security. When she questioned the co-defendant, he said he had to check with his wife about things and would get back to her. Well, he never did, so she's suing for the remaining $1,367. She most definitely deserves it.\n\nThese are the defendants, John and Christy Schaer. They say there were considerable problems when they did the walkthrough with the plaintiff, and they were being nice, refunding more than half the lady’s security. The fact that she’s suing them here today is laughable because they spent more money than they withheld to get the place even rentable again. They’re accused of doing a lady wrong.\n\nAll parties please raise your right hand.\n\nWelcome back to the People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff rented from the defendant for four years but isn’t getting her security back and says it’s because the defendant is afraid of his wife. But the defendants say they were generous; the plaintiff caused lots of problems in the unit. It’s the case of “your whip, I’m stiffed.”\n\nJUDGE: All right, Ena Puit, you are suing John and Christy Schaer for $1,367, a balance in a security deposit plus interest that you say they are wrongfully withholding. Yes? Talk to me.\n\nPLAINTIFF: On August 3rd, I received my item listing and my return check from my security deposit.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, how long had you lived there?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Four years.\n\nJUDGE: Since 20--? You always paid rent on time?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Well, not always on time. I made arrangements with them, and they agreed to them.\n\nJUDGE: Did you generally have a good relationship with them?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, and when you left, why did you leave?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I left because I had to downsize.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, so you leave, you do a walkthrough.\n\nPLAINTIFF: We did a walkthrough.\n\nJUDGE: Any comments made during the walkthrough?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: What were the comments?\n\nPLAINTIFF: The comments were on three holes in the walls that were on the main level floor of the smaller room. There was a hole in the kitchen screen, and then on the second level, there was the doorjamb. My granddaughter got locked in there by mistake. We opened it up. I had a friend try to fix it, and I guess it wasn’t fixed.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, so you point that out.\n\nPLAINTIFF: We all pointed it out together. It was written down, and those were the only damages spoken on.\n\nJUDGE: Who did the walkthrough? He did or she?\n\nPLAINTIFF: John and Christy.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, did they say anything else to you at that time?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No.\n\nJUDGE: All right, so you leave, and you're expecting your security deposit check. Did they say anything to you about the security deposit check on that date?\n\nPLAINTIFF: During the walkthrough, they said that they will get back to me with the amount of the repairs.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, and so when they got back to you, how did they get back to you?\n\nPLAINTIFF: In writing, it was 30 days later. I received the letter and the check on August 3rd.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, I need to see the letter and the check. Okay, so go on.\n\nPLAINTIFF: So when I received the letter and the check, immediately I called John on the phone. I shared with John on that day that I received the check and the letter, and I was in total disbelief and I was very upset and frustrated. I asked him to explain the contents of the letter. Why was it excessive? Because in that letter, it said they were going to charge from my security deposit: excessive cleaning, $300; damage to the upper bedroom doorframe, $150; damage to the walls, no figure; excessive wear carpet, $500; screen replacement, $50. That was a total of $1,000. So they sent me a check for $1,025.\n\nJUDGE: Correct.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Okay, and they were keeping $1,000 for damages.\n\nJUDGE: Correct.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Okay, you felt that was excessive. So what did you do?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Well, when I called him, I asked him, \"Could he explain to me what was the excessive cleaning and what was the excessive wear and tear on the carpet?\" He told me, \"Well, Ena, Christy sent that out to you. I need to talk to her.\" And at that time, he told me, \"Ena, I'm putting together papers for you, and you'll get them.\" I haven't heard from John since August 27th.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, what's going on, folks?\n\nDEFENDANT (John): Well, I don't disagree with a lot that Ena said. She was a tenant of ours for four years. She made several late payments, but we worked it out. In general, she was a good tenant, but she left the place a mess. We spent in excess of $9,000 fixing and repairing the place after she left.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, and uh, what was wrong with it?\n\nDEFENDANT (John): The carpets were ruined. We had broken doorframes, broken doors, holes in the walls. Appliances were left filthy, bathtubs left filthy, walls with grease all over them, holes in the kitchen floor. She had a leak. I don’t know what she did with a refrigerator, but ice jammed up, and the ice just kept coming down and ruined a ceiling in the apartment below.\n\nJUDGE: Wait, was it your refrigerator?\n\nDEFENDANT (John): Yes, it was our refrigerator.\n\nJUDGE: So what would she do?\n\nDEFENDANT (John): There was still some obligation to let us know. Somehow, the ice jammed up, and ice cubes kept coming out of the refrigerator.\n\nJUDGE: Right, but ice cubes don’t melt in a couple of seconds. What did the woman downstairs say?\n\nDEFENDANT (John): She called us and said her ceiling was falling in.\n\nJUDGE: Let me see the pictures of everything that you’re asking for.\n\n[Judge examines pictures.]\n\nJUDGE: All right, let’s see here. I see the holes in the wall, the damage to the doorframe. The carpet does look worn, but that could be regular wear and tear after four years. The cleaning charges—hmm. This kitchen doesn’t look spotless, but $300 is steep. Some of these damages make sense, but I believe the cleaning charge is excessive.\n\nJUDGE: The only place I think they got a little greedy was on the cleaning.

Plaintiff, you may begin with your opening statement.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Your Honor, the Defendant has continuously breached our contract, failing to meet agreed-upon deadlines and disregarding the terms we both signed. This has led to significant financial losses on our end. We seek fair compensation for these damages.\n\n**Judge:** Defendant, how do you respond to these allegations?\n\n**Defendant:** Your Honor, I strongly disagree with the Plaintiff's claims. The delays were due to unforeseen circumstances beyond my control. I had communicated these issues, but the Plaintiff refused to cooperate or offer any flexibility.\n\n**Judge:** Plaintiff, do you have evidence supporting your claim that the Defendant failed to meet the contractual obligations?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor. Here are emails and documented conversations where we repeatedly reminded the Defendant of the deadlines. We also have financial records showing our losses due to these delays.\n\n**Judge:** Defendant, do you have any evidence to counter the Plaintiff’s claims?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, Your Honor. I have records of my communications, including requests for extensions and explanations for delays. Additionally, I have expert testimony attesting to the industry-standard delays that were beyond my control.\n\n**Judge:** I see. I will review the submitted evidence carefully. Plaintiff, were there any attempts at mediation before filing this lawsuit?\n\n**Plaintiff:** We attempted to reach a resolution through discussions, but the Defendant was uncooperative and unwilling to compromise.\n\n**Defendant:** That is not entirely true, Your Honor. I offered alternative solutions, but the Plaintiff insisted on rigid terms.\n\n**Judge:** Very well. I will now hear closing statements. Plaintiff?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Your Honor, the Defendant’s negligence has cost us greatly. We upheld our end of the contract and expected the same in return. We respectfully request fair compensation.\n\n**Defendant:** Your Honor, I have done my best to fulfill the contract under difficult circumstances. I believe the Plaintiff is being unreasonable in their demands, and I ask the court to consider the full context.\n\n**Judge:** I have heard both sides and reviewed the presented evidence. Based on the contractual terms, the nature of the delays, and the communication between the parties, I rule in favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendant will be required to compensate the Plaintiff for financial damages incurred due to the delays.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n**Defendant:** I respectfully disagree but will comply with the court’s decision.\n\n**Judge:** This case is now closed.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection,Playing the Victim ,Gaslighting"}

{"id": "721", "dialogue": "JUDGE: This is the plaintiff, Shareif Ahmed. He says he was stopped at a seatbelt check on the Parkway, and just as the officer gave him the all-clear, he was rear-ended by the defendant. The defendant told him he was sorry because he was talking to his mother and promised to pay for his damages. But it’s been almost six months, and well, here they are. He’s suing for $2,680.02, the cost to repair his damage.\n\nJUDGE: This is the defendant, Jose Vega. He says the plaintiff was inching up and then just locked his brakes up, and he tapped his bumper. The plaintiff took all his information but never contacted him. He’s very surprised the plaintiff actually turned around and sued him. He’s suing him for way too much to boot and is trying to milk him for everything he’s worth. Owe him all that money? No way. He’s accused of not watching where he’s going.\n\nBAILIFF: All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nJUDGE: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff was rear-ended by the defendant just after a seatbelt check. The defendant says it was just a tap and the plaintiff is a scammer. It’s the case of ‘I Ta That.’ Litigants have been sworn. Your Honor.\n\nJUDGE: Shareif Ahmed, you are suing Jose Vega for $2,680.02 that you say he owes you to repair your car as a result of an accident that you say was his fault. Tell me what happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I was coming off the exit seatbelt check. I passed right through.\n\nJUDGE: Seatbelt check?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah, there was a County Police checkpoint making sure everything was legal as you were passing through. If you were doing anything illegal, you’d be pulled over. Right? So I went right through, stopped at the red light, about to go, and I get rear-ended.\n\nJUDGE: Were you stopped, and then they rolled into you? That’s not a reason to hit you, but I’m just asking—why do you think it happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I have no idea what happened.\n\nDEFENDANT: What actually happened was, he had pulled up to the light. The light changed, and he started making his way out.\n\nJUDGE: Were you going straight or turning?\n\nDEFENDANT: Right turn. He starts making his way out, and I actually hit him on the turn. He just stopped, so I ended up hitting him.\n\nJUDGE: You didn’t hit him that hard?\n\nDEFENDANT: No, which is why I really don’t feel like I did as much damage as he’s claiming.\n\nJUDGE: Let’s see. Do you have pictures of the damage?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, so let’s set it up. The plaintiff is driving, the defendant is behind him. The plaintiff stops in the middle of the turn, and that’s why the defendant hits him. Is that a defense?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Absolutely not. He should have had enough distance behind him to stop.\n\nJUDGE: But the argument is, when you make a turn, you’re supposed to complete it.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Someone could be in the crosswalk, and they could stop just in case.\n\nJUDGE: That’s a good point. Last word?\n\nDEFENDANT: I believe the law says if you rear-end someone, you’re at fault.\n\nJUDGE: What kind of car is this?\n\nPLAINTIFF: A Honda CR-V. He shattered my rear window.\n\nJUDGE: Shattered your window?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes. The door frame was bent.\n\nJUDGE: How do you figure you didn’t hit him hard when you shattered his windshield and bent the door frame?\n\nDEFENDANT: I barely have any damage to the front of my vehicle.\n\nJUDGE: Your car was better made. Why haven’t you paid for his damages?\n\nDEFENDANT: I don’t feel like I did that much damage.\n\nJUDGE: But you shattered his windshield.\n\nPLAINTIFF: He admitted fault at the scene, saying, “I’m so sorry, I wasn’t paying attention, I was talking to my mother.”\n\nJUDGE: Why didn’t you call the police?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He begged me not to.\n\nJUDGE: And then he never paid?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Right.\n\nJUDGE: And you found out he had no insurance?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, his insurance expired the day before the accident.\n\nDEFENDANT: I was on my way to pay it.\n\nJUDGE: You were driving on the way to pay for your insurance? Do I look stupid to you? That is not the truth. You had no insurance.\n\nJUDGE: You have zero defense. I find in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $2,680.02.

John Josco?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: You are suing The Frosted Baker, represented by none other than The Frosted Baker himself, Daniel Walsh, the owner, correct?\n\nDefendant: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, for two thousand dollars: your salary in July and salary in August that you believe you're entitled to.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And he does not believe you're entitled to it. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so we entered into an agreement—a broker-client relationship—on February 1st. I was to represent his product in certain markets that we decided. We made a list of certain customers that we were going to go after. In return, I would get a weekly stipend for my administrative services.\n\nJudge: So you would get a percentage if you got a deal, but also you would get a base salary?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And the base salary was how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $250 a week.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything in writing with him?\n\nDefendant: And what is it you do? What do you bake?\n\nDefendant: The Frosted Baker makes the finest, most highly decorated cookies in the world.\n\nJudge: I don’t see any cookies. No samples for the judge?

Listen, they’re good cookies.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s too bad. Did you bring me cookies?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay, well, I don’t have access to them anymore. Wait, wait—how does this work? You wholesale them?\n\nDefendant: Correct. We manufacture for large companies like QVC—we were on a couple of times—Williams Sonoma, those types of companies, tier-one retailers. We take their needs and we use our initiative and our decorators, which are the best, and we design their cookies and actually produce them. They’re all handmade, hand-decorated, and we can do that in the tens of thousands and keep the quality the same. So right now, we’re basically known as the industry standard in that segment, and we’re pretty highly recognized, pretty highly regarded.\n\nJudge: Now, this says, \"The agreement shall be for a term of six months from the date of renewal automatically, but either party can terminate this agreement during the year with 30 days' written notice.\"\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nDefendant: What happened was we brought John to Gurney, showed him the facility, introduced him to the team, explained in depth what the pricing was. John came on board, but we just didn’t get a feel that what we were investing in him was really going to produce anything. If you consider that the thousand dollars a month and a five percent commission rate is really worth about twenty thousand dollars in sales, we just really didn’t see it happening.\n\nJudge: You changed your mind? Or what did he do?\n\nDefendant: On March 14th, I sent him an email outlining my concerns and said at this point in time, we are going to trigger the one-month notice.\n\nJudge: What happened in February?\n\nDefendant: Not sure. Nothing.\n\nJudge: Did you produce anything?\n\nPlaintiff: I was just starting to set appointments.\n\nJudge: So in March, you say you’re exercising the 30-day notice?\n\nDefendant: March 14th.\n\nJudge: And what happens in March?\n\nPlaintiff: He made a stipulation that if I was to bring in an order, we would revisit the stipend. I did bring in an order, and they made me a custom product. We got a commitment for a big order and continued business as usual.\n\nJudge: How big was the order?\n\nPlaintiff: About 36,000 dollars.\n\nJudge: And when did you get the purchase order?\n\nPlaintiff: Toward the end of April.\n\nJudge: So what do you produce in April, May, June?\n\nPlaintiff: We didn’t produce anything from that point.\n\nJudge: When did you learn they were not interested in continuing to pay you $250 in expenses?\n\nPlaintiff: Probably toward the end of July. They just stopped paying me.\n\nJudge: When did they stop paying you?\n\nPlaintiff: June 30th.\n\nJudge: And then you want to get paid now for July and August?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: After you didn’t get the July 15th check, you reached out?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"I already resigned you back in March.\"\n\nJudge: But you’re still working for him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, favorite type of cookie?\n\nPlaintiff: Chocolate chip.\n\nDefendant: Snickerdoodle.\n\nJudge: Snickerdoodle?

I was a bridesmaid and I asked Scott if he wanted to go. They really wanted him to be there. We were all close friends and undergrad and he said yes.\nJudge: Well who else would you take, right? Either him or nobody, right? He was your boyfriend at the time or no?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: So we plan to meet down there in Boston. We each took a flight.

Um, I asked him do you want to share a hotel room and get a rental car together. He said yeah sure, so I put that on my credit card because at the time he wasn't working. So um, the total came to like 600.\nJudge: And what was the discussion about whether he would pay you or not?\nPlaintiff: I postponed that because-\nJudge: No, did you discuss when or if he'd pay you?\nPlaintiff: Not at the time, no.\nJudge: Well then why are you saying that it's a loan?\nPlaintiff: Because um, after we took the trip we were planning to move in together so he said if he was going to pay this amount for the security deposit for the hotel - or for the apartment, he couldn't afford to pay me back yet and I said that was fine.\nJudge: Was the understanding when you paid for the entire hotel room and the entire car - was the understanding that you would split it?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay, that's what I want to hear. What made you come to that understanding as opposed to that you're buying it as a gift for him?\nPlaintiff: That wasn't a gift.\nJudge: Because that's going to be his defense right? You're going to say I'm not supposed to pay that right?\nDefendant: Yeah, exactly.\nJudge: I - but I - this may be your first rodeo, it's not mine. So tell me what discussions you guys had about who's paying for what and how it's going to get paid back and all that other stuff.\nPlaintiff: Well at the time when we were talking about it when I put it on my card, I asked them I was like are we going to split this and he said yes. He also talked to Margaret and said that - she even had conversations with him.\nJudge: Okay, why is Margaret-\nWitness: We were living together.\nJudge: I was supposed to be a witness but - no no - you're not a - he doesn't owe you money does he?\nWitness: No he doesn't owe me-\nJudge: Missing that case and it's just them two. You're here as a witness?\nWitness: Yes I was just told-\nJudge: What did you witness? Did you witness any discussions between the two?\nWitness: I witnessed their phone conversations. I've also witnessed the breakup when they did break up for that minor time frame. I actually called Scotty and said are you okay because I was friends with him.\nJudge: Why did you guys break up?\nDefendant: The long distance like we didn't see each-\nJudge: How long did you date each other long distance?\nDefendant: Two years.\nWitness: Two years and a half at least.\n[Continued in next part due to length limit]\nJudge: Were you really involved in the relationship?\nWitness: I got dragged into the relationship-\nDefendant: Yes, as a matter of fact. As a matter of fact she was part of the reason that we got together and she was always around Nicole and I. However, you know during our relationship I was really just dating Nicole.\nJudge: Yeah I got - but like I'm glad you clarified that but I want - what I wanted to know is the two of you were friends, yes right?\nWitness: Yes.\nJudge: Okay, why did you guys break up?\nDefendant: We broke up because what happened was I decided that it wasn't going to be feasible enough for me to move up there because I wasn't going to have the finances. After that we argued through text message email all throughout this entire breakup before we got to this point and at that point I asked her how much was it for - she through text message gave me three different amounts that increased - one was $306.23, one was $326.23, one was $346.23 and I said wait okay these amounts don't seem to make any sense so I asked for copies of receipts or a redacted copy of a credit card statement and she refused to give them to me. As a matter of fact I have a text message here if you'd like to see.\nJudge: Let's see the bottom. You have your phone with the text messages?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: With the text messages to him bring that up.\nPlaintiff: Can I say something?\nJudge: Yeah, go ahead.\nPlaintiff: Okay, what were you going to say with that text message about him asking about why you-\nJudge: Different amounts?\nPlaintiff: Initially it was high and then I took it down.\nJudge: Oh is that accurate that the amount went down?\nDefendant: No.\nDefendant: I forward a text message to my mom - she's actually here because at the time what happened was I was getting so many text messages and phone calls from her job and the private number that actually had to change my phone number and that lost all my text messages. However my mom just so happened to have had them because I sent them to him at the time of the text message.\nJudge: Why are you sending your mother your girlfriend's text messages?\nDefendant: At the time I also have an email when we were planning on moving in together she sent my mother an email. I didn't ask - I didn't tell her what to say I just said since you can't be here at the moment why not just send her an email because I know she was working at the time. I wasn't going to ask her come on down here because my mom wanted to see you. She sent an email - I have the email here that she sent to my mom about her intentions when we moved in together so my mom was kind of roped into this.\nJudge: What does that have to do with you sharing with your mother every single email text that your girlfriend said? You got mommy issues.\nJudge: Listen how old are you?\nDefendant: 25.\nJudge: Thank you. You're too old to have mommy issues. Do long-distance romances work?\nDefendant: I don't think so.\nJudge: Why not?\nDefendant: The whole point of being in a relationship is like being with that person so if they're far away how's that going to work?\nJudge: Everybody buy that? Everybody agree with that?\nAudience Member: I agree.\nJudge: Okay. I want somebody new here - what do you think?\nAudience Member 2: I think it really depends on if you actually love that person. If it's like a new relationship and you guys make it long distance I think it'll definitely make it hard.\nJudge: What do you think - yay or nay?\nAudience Member 3: Nay because I think it's hard to like be far away from someone and like make it work out.\nJudge: Fair enough. Going inside the courtroom I see from what I did see there you're asking her how much is it and you're agreeing to pay. That doesn't sound like she was going to cover-\nDefendant: At the time I said okay I will - I will try to get you some money back because at that time I started working but I was only underemployed.\nJudge: So why is she writing this long email to your mother about her intentions?\nDefendant: When she sent the email - okay I had a discussion with my family, I thought about it again and then when I realized that the finances and everything just wasn't going to be fe-\nJudge: Yeah but did you tell her - did you suggest to her that she should talk to your mom about- Your mom wasn't happy about the idea of you moving?\nDefendant: Yes she - yes and she did she - she did speak to her on the phone as a matter of fact shortly after the - she sent the email uh my - she called my mother yeah the next day.\nJudge: Okay and how'd that work out? Mom you want- Yeah Mom why don't you come up. I'm just kind of jealous because I - I am because I think it's really nice that you have a son who cares so much about what you think. To me it's not entirely healthy but I think it's - it's kind of sweet.\nDefendant's Mother: I know it's not entirely healthy believe me.\nJudge: You're codependent believe me. I'm looking forward to the emptiness that's-\nDefendant's Mother: I thought I was supposed to get-\nJudge: You're not going to get this way if he sends you every text his girlfriend sends him. You're not going to get it this way.\nDefendant's Mother: I know I'm not going to get it this way. Okay my thing was is that it came out of left field the idea of him moving - of him moving and he graduated in the December of 2009 right? I've been sitting watching him literally stall for 3 years me screaming and yelling throwing clots you name it. Could you please go to school get this - go do this do you want to be a teacher so get your GPA up apply to this school apply to that school go here do that just go ahead I want to see you move forward with your life that's what I want to see you do go ahead and get it done then next thing I know I hear I want going to move to Buffalo. I'm like you're underemployed down state. I said there unemployment rate up in Buffalo is higher than it is down here so can you explain me how in the world you are going to go in on a lease where she's going to expect you to pay half the expenses with no money? I said believe me take - take it from me love is lovely no money there out the window gone.\nJudge: Okay I'm going to start sending her all the texts that come to me too because now I can see why he likes her advice and and worships her advice because she's kind of right about every single thing she said. She might have done you a huge favor.\nJudge: Yeah you may not realize it but she might have been doing you a huge huge favor because you're in love with them and you don't see the financial blocks but a grown-up does because we've all been through it already right? You know I understand it all right but in any event go ahead have a seat Mom thank you and I will have a cappuccino later.\nJudge: Listen what is your defense to the lawsuit? I understand what your defense might be to the $653.44 of pain and suffering - what the heck's that about? You're just trying to get your lawsuit to a thousand, no?\nPlaintiff: Oh really?\nJudge: Because I can't help but notice that's how you did it but tell me what that is - what is your pain and suffering?\nPlaintiff: The fact that because he didn't move I didn't have a place to stay I had to give up my job.\nJudge: Do you seriously think that that's what courts are in business for to make people pay people because they break up?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: Okay so you can't possibly think that that's a serious lawsuit that portion of your lawsuit is completely bogus?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: So now let's discuss your counter claim against her because I really - I haven't heard a single defense on your - on the actual expense of the Boston trip. Now you have counter claimed against her half of all of your travel expenses that you've ever spent in five years to go visit her.\nDefendant: I'm - I'm suing because she's-\nJudge: You got nanny booboo that's why you're suing.\nJudge: Okay well you can't possibly think that I'm going to Grant your request there either. Okay the here's what it is - it's either a gift or a loan and if you're supposed to pay her back then you got to pay her back and I can see from the text that you're supposed to pay her back. You're only here because you refused to pay the whatever amount it was $36.25. It's actually less than all those figures I don't know why she- if you had been less messy this would have been less messy. The amount is $36.23 plus prejudgment statutory interest in your state plus your filing fee that is my verdict. On your counter claim against her zero.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): We moved into his apartment about a year ago and paid twenty-seven hundred dollars for the security deposit, plus we paid five hundred dollars for a pet deposit.\n\nJudge: What kind of pet was it?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): A small dachshund.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): We signed a lease, and we also signed an agreement that the pet deposit would be returned once we moved out, provided there was no damage to the apartment.\n\nJudge: Correct.\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): We gave notice to Mr. Rivera in December that we would be vacating the apartment on January 27th.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): On January 30th, we met with Mr. Rivera in the apartment and did an inspection. During the inspection, he noted two things. One was that the shower heads were missing.\n\nJudge: Why were they missing?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): He claims that the shower heads were there when we moved in, but they were not. I actually purchased the shower heads.\n\nJudge: Why would you rent a place without shower heads? Why weren’t they there?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): They weren’t there when we moved in. When we first looked at the apartment, the shower heads were there, but when we moved in, they were not.\n\nJudge: Do you have any record of saying to him, \"Hey, where are the shower heads? We need to buy shower heads\"?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): No, I do not.\n\nJudge: No, you don’t?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): No.\n\nJudge: Because otherwise, if you ran out and bought shower heads, it sounds like you beautified the shower heads instead of telling your landlord, \"What the heck? I can’t take a shower.\" You know what I’m saying?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): Yeah, we just went out and bought shower heads and didn’t say anything to him.\n\nJudge: It’s unusual.\n\nPlaintiff (Julio Ocasio): In January, with the help of a lawyer, I sent him a letter saying we’d be moving out February 28th and we’d be living out our part of the security.\n\nJudge: Yes, but you can’t do that. I’m surprised a lawyer would tell you to do that.\n\nPlaintiff (Julio Ocasio): Yes, you could, because of the fact that the security—\n\nJudge: No, you can’t. You can’t live out security. Security is for the purpose of security. You’re supposed to pay.\n\nPlaintiff (Julio Ocasio): Everybody does it.\n\nJudge: A lot of people do it, but that’s not legally permissible. Landlords put up with it because, by the time they go to court, three months have passed. But let’s talk about this.\n\nJudge: The day comes when they’re moving out. You live out the security deposit, leaving a remaining $900 in security deposit, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Julio Ocasio): Yes.\n\nJudge: Plus the $500 pet deposit, which brings us to $1,400, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): Yes.\n\nJudge: Then you were demanding the 63% interest, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): Yes.\n\nJudge: Instead of getting $1,463, what you got was $462.99 back from him, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): That is correct.\n\nJudge: And does he explain why he’s withholding the rest of the money?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): He was withholding $45 for the shower heads, $100 for two light fixtures that had to be put back up, and $855 to redo the floors.\n\nJudge: Okay. Defendant, why did you have to redo the floors?\n\nDefendant (David Rivera): They had put up TVs and ripped them off, leaving holes. The floors had water damage from their refrigerator. I have pictures.\n\nJudge: Let me see the pictures.\n\n(Examines pictures)\n\nJudge: That just needs paint, right?\n\nDefendant (David Rivera): No, the floors needed sanding.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, did you remove the refrigerator?\n\nPlaintiff (Rosamondejo): Yes, but I didn’t see water damage.\n\nJudge: Looking at this, I don’t think this is normal wear and tear. I find that you still owe a remaining $380.01. Verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, exxaggeration"}
{"id": "357", "dialogue": "JUDGE: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nWelcome to The People's Court. This case involves the plaintiffs, who hired the defendant to cater their wedding at a historic museum. They claim the defendant knew the museum was closing but still took their deposit. The defendant, however, argues that the museum was not the only option and that he is still available to provide his services.\n\nPlaintiffs, you are suing Bernard’s catering business for $2,749.62, the amount of your deposit. You’ve requested that we not use the name of the business or Bernard’s last name.\n\nJUDGE: Did you two get married already?\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): No, not yet.\n\nJUDGE: Alright. What happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): We got engaged in April of last year.\n\nJUDGE: Congratulations!\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): Thank you. When we started looking for a venue, one of the first places we thought of was the Dow Museum in St. Augustine, Florida. We had attended a wedding there six years ago and fell in love with the place. It’s charming, rustic, historic, and outdoors.\n\nJUDGE: St. Augustine is a beautiful and historic city. Do you live there?\n\nPLAINTIFF (IVAN DOE): We live in Jacksonville, about 45 minutes away.\n\nJUDGE: My child is in fourth grade, so she’s taking a trip to St. Augustine soon. It’s part of the Florida history curriculum.\n\nGo on.\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): We contacted the Dow Museum, and they provided us with Bernard’s information. They said that if we wanted to rent the venue, we had to go through Bernard.\n\nJUDGE: Because you are their exclusive caterer?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): Yes, ma’am.\n\nJUDGE: Tell me about the Dow Museum.\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): It’s a cluster of old historic houses with courtyards and gardens. The entire property is about a city block. The homes have been preserved, and you can rent the venue for weddings.\n\nJUDGE: How old are the houses?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): They were built in the 1700s.\n\nJUDGE: Wow.\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): We visited the museum with Bernard and his wife. They showed us where the ceremony and reception would be.\n\nTwo days later, after discussing it, Ivan and I decided to move forward. We asked for an estimate for the venue and catering.\n\nJUDGE: So, you worked out the details, signed a contract stating the event would be at the Dow Museum with Bernard as the caterer, and you put down a deposit of $2,749.62. There’s no dispute about that?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): That’s correct.\n\nJUDGE: Then what happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): After New Year’s, we started ramping up our wedding planning. Our wedding date is October 20th of this year.\n\nWe went back to the Dow Museum one Saturday to take pictures and plan. We spoke with the ticket taker at the museum, explaining that we were getting married there and wanted to look around.\n\nShe got a concerned look on her face and asked who we were working with and when our wedding was.\n\nWhen we told her, she said, “I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Dow Museum is in the process of being sold to the Children’s Museum.” She told us that all weddings in May had already been canceled.\n\nJUDGE: At that point, did you think your wedding was safe?\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): We hoped so. We assumed no news was good news.\n\nJUDGE: Sometimes, no news is just no news.\n\nPLAINTIFF (CLAIRE JACKSON): Yes, we were optimistic. We immediately texted Bernard.\n\nJUDGE: Bernard, in January, when she contacted you, did you know there was going to be a problem?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): No, I hadn’t heard yet.\n\nJUDGE: So, after she reached out, what did you do?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): I left several messages for the new owners to find out what was happening. When I finally got a response, they told me they didn’t want any more weddings until after May 15th.\n\nJUDGE: But Claire’s wedding is in October.\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): Yes, so I told them that I had a wedding booked in October and asked if we could work something out.\n\nThey said they might be under construction but would do their best to accommodate us.\n\nJUDGE: They couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t be construction during Claire’s wedding, could they?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): No, they couldn’t.\n\nJUDGE: So, why am I here?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): I was trying to see if the wedding could still happen there.\n\nJUDGE: If the museum was the whole reason for the plaintiffs booking with you, do they get their money back?\n\n(To the audience) What do you think?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER 1: Yes. They paid for it.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Yes. They didn’t get what they paid for.\n\nJUDGE: But the defendant is still offering his services, just not at the museum.\n\n(To Bernard) You were their exclusive caterer for that venue. If the venue is no longer available, that changes everything, doesn’t it?\n\nDEFENDANT (BERNARD): I’m still available to cater their event. I’ve shown them other venues.\n\nJUDGE: But they chose the Dow Museum for their wedding. You were tied to that location. Since that location is no longer available, you need to return their deposit.\n\nJudgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $2,749.62.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, minimization"}

How did this come to light here? Actually, you know what—put a pin in that for a moment because really, I want to know what happened here.\n\nJudge (to Scott):\nYou had a boat that you got—how?\n\nDefendant (Scott):\nI had a boat that was given to me, which I then put up on a website for free. Victor got a hold of me and said he wanted the boat.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you get the boat from point A to point B?\n\nScott:\nI had it on a trailer, and I brought it to his property.\n\nJudge:\nWhat kind of property is this?\n\nPlaintiff (Peter):\nI have two commercial buildings with a big parking lot between them. It’s a parking lot for two businesses.\n\nJudge (to Victor):\nSo, who gave you permission to leave it in the parking lot of two businesses?\n\nVictor:\nWell, um… I assumed it was a friend of mine’s property.\n\nJudge:\nWait—whose property did you assume it was?\n\nVictor:\nUm… another friend of TAA.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you know her how?\n\nVictor:\nThrough my brother, who has, um… you know, friends.\n\nJudge:\nI’m trying to understand how you go about thinking that it would be okay to dump a boat that you received for free in someone’s parking lot.\n\nJudge (sternly):\nI need you to put your big boy pants on now and explain to me why you thought that was possible. Who gave you permission to do that?\n\nVictor:\nUh… I was given permission from, um… TAA to drop it off on her property. I believed she said that was her property.\n\nJudge:\nNo—what did she say exactly?\n\nVictor:\nShe had told me that the part where I left the boat wasn’t her property.\n\nJudge:\nWhere’s her property?\n\nVictor:\nIt’s right behind—kind of right together. It’s just separated by a fence.\n\nJudge:\nWhy haven’t you moved the boat since realizing it’s in the wrong place?\n\nVictor:\nWell, um… when we put it there, before it was officially off the trailer, someone came to us and was on the phone with Peter. Peter had agreed that I could leave the boat there for $50.\n\nJudge (to Peter):\nDid that happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Peter):\nNot quite that way.\n\nJudge:\nWhat way did it happen?\n\nPeter:\nI got a call from a friend of mine who has a motor home. He stays in it once in a while and was around the corner of the building. He heard something going on and came out to take a look.\n\nThen he calls me.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you get on the phone with Victor?\n\nPeter:\nYes. Victor said, “I need to leave a boat here on the trailer, and I’ll come by in the morning, and we’ll discuss what needs to be done.”\n\nJudge:\nWhy wouldn’t you say no? Why didn’t you say, \"Get your boat off my property\"?\n\nPeter:\nWell, I try to accommodate—\n\nJudge (interrupting):\nNo, no, no. That sounds so weird. Why didn’t you just say, \"Get your boat off my property\"?\n\nPeter:\nThe next day, I came into work and saw a boat up on three piles of concrete blocks with some wood. Right away, I knew I’d been duped.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you say duped, why?\n\nPeter:\nWell, I know a little bit about boats—not much, but enough. I knew when a boat is not seaworthy and really should be disposed of. When I saw it up on blocks, I said, “This is trouble.”\n\nThen, when Victor showed up, I found out that he had been duped too.\n\nJudge (to Victor):\nDid you go up and see the boat?\n\nVictor:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nHow old are you?\n\nVictor:\nTwenty-two.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you’re an idiot.\n\nVictor:\nYeah…\n\nJudge:\nI cannot tell you the many ways that you are, because what you did was take his headache off his hands and make it your headache.\n\nThen, by taking this behemoth off of a trailer and putting it on blocks, you have no idea the headache you’ve created. It is so monumental.\n\nJudge:\nHow is it going to leave there?\n\nVictor:\nI didn’t get to that.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, yeah—you’ve got to connect the dots, Victor. But in the meantime, what’s your plan? Because you can’t leave it there.\n\nAnd two months have passed. You have no plan.\n\nJudge:\nDo you know what it’s going to take to get that boat off now that it’s off the trailer?\n\nVictor:\nYou just hook up the winch—\n\nJudge:\nA winch on what?\n\nVictor:\nOn the front of the trailer. The trailer has a crank that cranks boats on and off.\n\nJudge:\nYou need the trailer.\n\nVictor:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have the trailer?\n\nVictor:\nI don’t have the trailer anymore.\n\nJudge:\nLiar.\n\nVictor:\nI don’t.\n\nJudge (to Scott):\nDo you have the trailer?\n\nScott:\nNo, I do.\n\nJudge:\nShow me proof you sold the trailer.\n\nScott:\nI don’t have it with me.\n\nJudge (to Peter):\nSo, you're suing him—why?\n\nPeter:\nBecause I have to dispose of the boat.\n\nJudge:\nNo, no—I know why you’re suing Victor.\n\nAre you kidding me? Did it sound like I didn’t know you were suing Victor?\n\nYou’re suing Scott—why?\n\nPeter:\nBecause I felt Scott took advantage of an unsuspecting victim.\n\nJudge:\nThat may be true, but how does that give you a right to sue Scott?\n\nThere’s a concept in the law called standing. It means I can't just be a social justice warrior and sue people because I think something is unfair.\n\nYou have the right to sue Victor because Victor trespassed on your property and dumped something there.    Judge (to Peter):\nYou have the right to sue Victor because he trespassed on your property and dumped something there.\n\nBut you don’t have the right to sue Scott unless you can point to some reason why Scott has a duty to you.\n\nPeter:\nScott misled Victor.\n\nJudge:\nThat may be true, but he misled Victor—not you.\n\nVictor could sue Scott, but you cannot sue Scott for misleading Victor.\n\nSo, your case against Scott is dismissed.\n\nYour case against Victor? You’re 100% right—he dumped something on your property that now costs you money to remove. That’s his problem, not yours.\n\nJudge (to Victor):\nSo, I am finding in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of $2,670.\n\nVictor—you need to get your life together. I’m telling you now: you need to start thinking.\n\nVictor:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nGood luck.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": " persuasion, minimization, framing the narrative, evasion"}

Next case on the docket, the Plaintiff says he knows the 89-year-old driver hit his car in the VA parking lot, but the Defendant says the Plaintiff is dreaming it up. It’s the case of Car Wars. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Allan Hayatt?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You are suing David Lieberwitz for $2,113 to fix your car because, according to you, Mr. Lieberwitz hit your car, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I parked my car outside the Veterans Hospital on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn. I had an appointment. When I came out, there was damage to the back of my bumper. It was gouged and scratched and slightly ajar. I had checked the car before I went in—I always check the car when I park the car—and there was no damage on the bumper.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, was Mr. Lieberwitz’s car parked behind yours?\n\nPlaintiff: It was parked behind me when I returned.\n\nJudge: When you returned, was he in the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he was not.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I waited for him to get into his car to make sure it was the right party. I came over to the window. I told him that he struck the car in front of him. He said, \"I didn’t.\" I said, \"Well, come out and take a look at what you did.\" He came out, and he saw nothing. I pointed it out to him.\n\nJudge: Now, there was damage to your car that you say was fresh?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And by fresh, you mean what?\n\nPlaintiff: Fresh meaning that there was paint on the bumper that wasn’t there when I parked the car.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can I see the damage to your car? Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\n(Photos are presented to the Judge.)\n\nJudge: So, did you show that damage to him?\n\nPlaintiff: I pointed it out to him. At first, he didn’t see it and just scoffed it off as something he didn’t do.\n\nJudge: Oh, wait, his bumper’s off! Is this—you’re the dark car?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m the gray car, and he’s the white car.\n\nJudge: That’s correct. His bumper is ripped off!\n\nPlaintiff: Right, but I don’t believe it’s ripped off on the other side. It’s ripped off on the left side. This damage is on the right side. It’s on my left, his right.\n\nJudge: So that bumper came off some other way, probably. Oh Lord.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: I—I came over to his car, walked with my wife to his car, and he was taking pictures. Movies! I said, \"What are you taking movies about?\"\n\nPlaintiff: You banged into my car.\n\nDefendant: I said, \"I never touched your car. Never!\" Now, I can drive. I’m definitely not—\n\nJudge: So, how do you know about this? Did you see? Did you find—did you see him?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t see him, but he did it.\n\nDefendant: Well, why did I do it if you didn’t see me? I was here, and nobody saw me! In other words, he had no witnesses over there that I did it. He was not there at the scene when it happened.\n\nJudge: See, I’m looking at damage to his car, and then looking at damage to yours.\n\nDefendant: Scratches. I’m sorry—two little scratches! You could barely see them.\n\nJudge: No, I can see them pretty clearly, sir. These are the pictures of the damage to his car.\n\nJudge: What year is your car, sir?\n\nDefendant: It’s a 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\nJudge: Did you hit his car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lieberwitz, did you hit his car?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Your bumper is hanging off the car. How did that happen?\n\nDefendant: I had an accident about two weeks before this thing happened. But believe me, the bumper never touched him.\n\nJudge: I understand. But here is the picture he took of the damage on the right side of your car, which is gray in color, which is the color of his car. Did you see that?\n\nDefendant: But that has nothing to do with the accident!\n\nJudge: You've been driving for how long?\n\nDefendant: Oh, I’m 89 years old and I’ve been driving since I’m 17.\n\nJudge: Should there be an age cutoff for drivers?\n\nDefendant: Yes, there should.\n\nJudge: What’s the age cutoff?\n\nDefendant: I would say about 88 to 90.\n\nJudge: How old are you?\n\nDefendant: 78.\n\nJudge: Okay, you’ve got a little time, don’t you?\n\nJudge: Based on what I have in front of me, I do find in favor of the Plaintiff in this case, and I’m going to award the entire $2,113.

When did you stop paying rent and why?\n\nDefendant: When we both—it came to, like, a mutual thing. We—he wasn't paying, I wasn't paying. We both got into, like, an argument, like a, you know, a verbal altercation or whatnot. He owes this, I owe that, and so neither of us paid.\n\nJudge: So neither of you paid?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: And then the landlord filed a case against you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What are the results of that case, or is it still pending?\n\nPlaintiff: It's completely done. I paid everything off, meaning I paid off Aaron's share as well as my own. I have receipts for all of that.\n\nJudge: All right, so what did you pay?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, there was interest accrued for every day, it was 39 cents, and considering I got behind—\n\nJudge: Just tell me what you paid.\n\nPlaintiff: It was like 3,266 dollars at the end of it all.\n\nJudge: Your lawsuit is for 3,241.67, so according to you, the landlord was suing for double that, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Not—well, double minus interest, of course.\n\nJudge: How much did the landlord sue you for?\n\nPlaintiff: (Looks at paperwork) 4,535 dollars.\n\nJudge: Oh, that's very different from 6,400 and something or 5,000-something. See, and when you're suing for 3,241, you're telling me that's his half. Half means that you're being sued for 6,400 and some odd. Now, how much are you actually being sued for?\n\nPlaintiff: 4,535 dollars.\n\nJudge: So why wouldn’t you sue for half of that here? Why are you trying to make money?\n\nPlaintiff: It's not making money; it's the interest accrued that was all on the portion that he owed because I was up to date on my portion.\n\nJudge: Show me the settlement paperwork.\n\n(Brief pause as paperwork is handed over.)\n\nJudge: Now, what did you end up doing? Did you move his stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, because we were going to get evicted. So I had to clear out the whole apartment. The landlord kept requesting that we move out so that he doesn’t have to call the sheriffs and have the sheriffs remove everything and then have a big bill for that.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: So what I did was start moving all our stuff out. And since Aaron never came home—he would be gone for like a week at a time or two weeks at a time—every time me and the landlord texted him, there was no response. So—\n\nJudge: Okay, what else was I going to do? Get stuck with the bill for all the stuff that was left there? So what did you do with the stuff? You just get rid of it?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I put it all in storage at a friend’s house.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t have to pay storage. And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It stayed at the friend’s house for months, and I never heard from Aaron back.\n\nJudge: And where’s your stuff?\n\nDefendant: Well, the reason is that when I came home one day, I saw half of my stuff was all outside. He sold a bunch of my couch, my table, to one of my buddies who lived in another town.\n\nJudge: Your buddy bought your table?\n\nDefendant: Nothing was sold. He helped him move it into his place in the Bronx.\n\nJudge: So it was given?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: You’ve given or sold, but yeah. I went there, and I looked at my buddy’s house, and I saw my couch there.\n\nJudge: All right, I understand the situation. I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of 2,267.50 plus pre-judgment statutory interest.

{"id": "268", "dialogue": "Judge: Paul Anemone, you are suing your former landlord, Darlene Harris, for $300 that she retained from your security deposit, which you feel she did so wrongfully. Tell me what happened here.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, basically, I moved into the apartment in June.\n\nJudge: Of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, 2017. June 1st, 2017.\n\nPlaintiff: I originally had a previous landlord to whom I had sent my security deposit of $1,800. She owned the building—the property I was living in was a house.\n\nJudge: A two-family house?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you moved in June 1st. And you moved in as a tenant as well?\n\nDefendant: Yes, on June 1st also. I was negotiating buying the house, but I had to move in because my previous lease was over. So I moved in as a tenant while negotiating the purchase.\n\nJudge: And then you ended up buying the house?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: When did you buy the house?\n\nDefendant: The closing was on August 1st.\n\nJudge: So just a few months after you moved in, and she moved in. Did you know she was going to become your landlord, or did you have no idea about the sale?\n\nPlaintiff: I knew the house was for sale.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: Basically, while living there, sometimes there was loud music being played—sometimes until 10:00 at night. And I have two small children also living with me on the weekends, and I also have a teenage daughter. So with the music, it was hard for her to study.\n\nJudge: Your year lease ends, and she doesn’t renew it, right?\n\nPlaintiff: She didn’t renew it.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you renew it?\n\nDefendant: I had acquired him as a tenant. It’s a one-bedroom apartment, and as he said, he had three kids and his girlfriend up there.\n\nJudge: Were you the only one on the lease?\n\nPlaintiff: I was the only one on the lease.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nDefendant: I wanted all the noise over my head to stop.\n\nJudge: So it was noisy for you?\n\nDefendant: Very noisy.\n\nJudge: So you warned him that you weren’t going to renew the lease, and you stayed an extra month, and that’s fine with everybody, and then you leave. There’s no walkthrough, and then you get your security deposit back, minus $300. Was there a letter included?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, there was a letter.\n\nJudge: Do you have it?\n\nDefendant: We do.\n\nJudge: What is the reason you kept the $300?\n\nDefendant: Because of the damages. Well, not so much the damages but the state he left the apartment in.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of how he left the apartment?\n\nDefendant: I have pictures, yes.\n\nJudge: May I see the pictures?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, so tell me about how he left it that you feel was so inappropriate. What did he do?\n\nDefendant: I spent three and a half hours cleaning up after him. The broken pole that supported the clothes in the closet, the oven, and the microwave, which was a mess, the stuff he left under the…\n\nJudge: Tell me about the stuff he left. What did he leave behind?\n\nDefendant: Two inflatable mattresses. There was a pile of stuff, so I just took a picture.\n\nJudge: What happened to the rug there?\n\nPlaintiff: When I moved in, that was actually in a storage area, almost like a walk-in attic. And it was like that when I moved in.\n\nJudge: Wasn’t the place entirely renovated?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: That part wasn’t renovated. That rug was never put in when I moved in. It was like that.\n\nJudge: But what part of your apartment was renovated?\n\nPlaintiff: The kitchen, the bathroom.\n\nJudge: What happened to the kitchen?\n\nDefendant: There are scratches all over the drawer.\n\nPlaintiff: The cabinets were a little loose when they were installed.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t look like something an installer did. That looks like use—improper use.\n\nJudge: What’s this a picture of?\n\nDefendant: The oven.\n\nJudge: What’s wrong with this curtain rod?\n\nDefendant: It’s bent. He left it like that.\n\nJudge: Did you install the curtain rods?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and the previous landlord said as long as I used small holes, it was fine.\n\nJudge: Did you cover up the holes when you left?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I left the rods up there.\n\nJudge: Why did you leave the shelves behind?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have room for them in the moving truck.\n\nJudge: Why would you leave that behind?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m sorry.\n\nJudge: How did you come up with the figure $300?\n\nDefendant: I paid my son and nephew $200 to clean.\n\nJudge: If the landlord cleans it himself, can he charge what it would have cost to hire a cleaning crew?\n\nAudience: Yes.\n\nJudge: I think the $300 is fair and reasonable.

Next case on the docket—the plaintiff bought a 1998 Pontiac, and it was a lemon, but the plaintiff returned it and didn’t get the full deposit back. The defendant says the plaintiff drove it for two years and still he took it back. It’s the case of the ’98 ain’t great. Thank you. Mr. Johnson, you are suing Mr. Shandorf for $220. You say he still owes you money from the return of a lemon he sold you. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, me and Mr. Shandorf used to work together. He sold me a car on Friday. As soon as I took the car home, the brakes went.\n\nJudge: What kind of car?\n\nPlaintiff: He sold me a 1998 Bonneville.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: As soon as I took the car home—\n\nJudge: 1998, huh?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. Soon as I took the car—\n\nJudge: Old enough to vote. Maybe old enough to drink. Wow.\n\nPlaintiff: The car sprayed brake fluid everywhere, and it had no more brakes. So I called George that night and let him know. And I felt like he already knew because there was a bottle of brake fluid in the back seat.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I figured that he put enough fluid in it to get it down there.\n\nJudge: Did he ever tell you anything about it needing brake fluid?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Were you deluding yourself into thinking that a car that old wouldn’t have some problems and that maybe you should have had it checked by a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t mind doing the rest of the work to it.\n\nJudge: What do you mean, \"the rest of the work\"?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t expect for it to have brake problems.\n\nJudge: Why is that? I mean, it’s going to have some problems. You didn’t expect for any problems?\n\nPlaintiff: Didn’t even get it inspected.\n\nJudge: You don’t know.

How much did he pay for the car?\n\nDefendant: The car is worth about $1,200 to $1,400.\n\nJudge: Okay, he paid $600 for the car.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: If the car was worth $1,200 or $1,300, you better believe you would have sold it for $1,200 or $1,300. It’s worth what someone will pay you. Apparently, it’s not God’s gift to cars and transportation because he couldn’t even make it home in that piece of garbage.\n\nDefendant: No. Oh, no, he did. He took the car home.\n\nJudge: Did you make it home?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: That’s what I thought.\n\nPlaintiff: The fluid went out all the way.

And he’s counterclaiming $2,463.37, the balance that you owe on it plus the stop payment fee. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff James: What happened was that on May 23rd last year, we went to his store and spoke to two salespeople and told them we wanted a custom sofa. It would be the highest quality, cushions aligned, non-lumpy, no creases, and would last for a very long time. So they both told us that if we spent $6,000, we would get this kind of a sofa and we would have what we wanted for our entire life.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: Upon receiving the sofa—\n\nJudge: Wait, did you sit on the sofa and see it in person?\n\nPlaintiff James: They carry the same line there, but the custom sofa was not there that we got.\n\nJudge: They carry the line?\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: The Harden line, right.\n\nJudge: So you picked it out of a catalog?\n\nPlaintiff James: A catalog, but they also had on the floor three of the same sofas made by that company.\n\nJudge: I gotcha. Okay. Alright. So what’s in your hand?\n\nPlaintiff James: Okay, what’s in my hand is the sofa that we were told we would be getting.\n\nJudge: Okay, can I—\n\nPlaintiff James: They’re similar to it. I’m not sure if it’s the exact sofa.\n\nJudge: Okay. And what ends up happening?\n\nPlaintiff James: What winds up happening is what we received.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: These are pictures that we took, uh, like a day or two after they delivered the second time.\n\nJudge: And, and we did put a stop check— Wait, wait. Do you have pictures from the first time?\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: No, because he came out and he agreed they would take it back, and he—\n\nPlaintiff James: Yeah, they wanted us to provide them a list, which we did.\n\nJudge: So when they came out the first time—\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: A list of what we felt was wrong, yeah. So we gave them a list of eight different things to be fixed after the first delivery.\n\nJudge: So the delivery didn’t stay there?\n\nPlaintiff James: They took it back.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: And they told us if we would detach the cushions, it would come back to us nice, aligned, straight, tightly stuffed. It was redelivered to us again in November. It did not come that way. That list was given to him in August. It was not followed. Only one of eight things was correctly done, and he promised he would do those parts.\n\nJudge: Alright, now what’s wrong with the sofa the second time? I have these pictures that you put into evidence. What I’d like you to do is go up, either one of you, whoever wants to, and tell me what to notice in the picture.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: Well, not both of you now.\n\nPlaintiff James: Okay, alright. Well, see how these, uh, cushions— they’re not aligned? And this cushion here, I don’t know if you can see it, but to me, that doesn’t look really straight-lined.\n\nJudge: It bows back?\n\nPlaintiff James: Yeah, it curves back, and they’re lumpy. I don’t—\n\nJudge: Is this something that you had asked on your list to overstuff them?\n\nPlaintiff James: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: No, no, no. Yes and no. We asked for something to make them height.\n\nJudge: So when you say they wouldn’t be lumpy cushions like this—\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: So did they put more in it or lessen it?\n\nPlaintiff James: We think he—I don’t know, we don’t know how he did it. Because the second time—\n\nJudge: Closer to the microphone, you can’t promise.\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: When it came back the second time, he said, \"I’ll take them back and I’ll try to fix them for you, but I can’t promise anything.\" The second time they were delivered, we were also going to complain. He agreed the second time they weren’t in the best quality.\n\nJudge: The second time? This is after you stopped payment?\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff James: Yes.\n\nJudge: Now, we did stop payment because—\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: He was very emphatic that he wanted his money. He was very upset. He said, \"I want my money now,\" and so we had to get rid of him. So I just gave him a check and then—\n\nJudge: Well, what good does it do to give him a check and then stop payment?\n\nPlaintiff James: He wouldn’t leave!\n\nJudge: Yeah, that does— Alright. \"I want my money now, I’m not leaving, I’m so upset.\" Who’s saying that?\n\nPlaintiff James: He’s physically at your house?\n\nPlaintiff Marsha: Yes.

I’ll give you a free bottle of this to get out the creases whenever you want to get them out.\"\n\nJudge: Okay, well, that’s not going to happen.\n\n[Full conversation continues...]\n\nJudge: I’m not gonna make them finish paying for it, and I’m gonna ask you to please pick it up from their home.

{"id": "325", "dialogue": "Judge: George Reyes, you're suing your son's friend Denzel Given for $2,822 for damage that he did to your car when you were trying to collect on a debt for a car you bought him that he also hasn't paid for according to you. Tell me your version, what's going on?\nPlaintiff: I met Mr. Given around May of 2012.\nJudge: How did you know him?\nPlaintiff: Through my son.\nJudge: How long had they been friends?\nPlaintiff: They started working together this year, they just met this year.\nPlaintiff: My son was telling me he was having transportation problems. He had one car and the wife got into an accident - a hit and run. So now they were down to no car and he was having transportation problems to get to and from work. He was on the verge of losing his job because of that. My son and I offered - he didn't ask us - we offered him assistance and he took it. I took him to a car dealership, we bought a car.\nJudge: I have to ask you why? To assist him why? I mean somebody who your son had just met or your son really really close to him?\nPlaintiff: No they weren't really close but I mean I need to meet a better class of people apparently because none of my friends would buy me a car.\nJudge: I mean we saw his kind of world literally falling apart where nobody was stepping forward to assist him.\nJudge: Nobody? Nobody in his life except for that? Now you figured out why I think so.\nJudge: So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is okay so you saw somebody in need so you decided to shell out $1,400 bucks?\nPlaintiff: The point is everybody needs assistance at one point or another in their life.\nJudge: Absolutely.\nPlaintiff: And we stepped forward to the plate.\nJudge: I mean you know I'd like to be able to say isn't that great but I can't help but notice you're a litigant in my courtroom.\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: So you didn't obviously you didn't know him very well?\nPlaintiff: No we didn't.\nJudge: I haven't heard your side of the story of course but but based on what you're claiming happened it doesn't sound like you made a very good decision. So then what happens you step up to a virtual stranger and decide to buy them a car and then what?\nPlaintiff: I purchased the car. Denzel was with me at the time we both went to the car dealership. I gave the car the money to the dealership. I put the car under his name. On top of that I told him when you get up on your feet you know start paying me whatever you can. I gave him three months. Around the fourth month I was texting him telling him what's going on you know you haven't paid me nothing.\nJudge: And what did he say?\nPlaintiff: Text me back something about he had problems.\nJudge: Do you have the text in your phone?\nPlaintiff: I have one prior to the 18th of October where we had a dispute.\nJudge: So you start texting him when?\nPlaintiff: Around October.\nJudge: And then his response to you is I have no money right now, problems and then you say to him?\nPlaintiff: I told him well I'll tell you what why don't we take it to a car title loan office where they lend you money on your car title and I told them look whatever they give you give it to me and we'll squash the rest. We don't have to worry about it just give me what you can get for the car and you could pay them.\nJudge: Right and apparently he did do that he kept the money. How do you know he did it?\nPlaintiff: Because it's on the police report.\nJudge: Really? So then what happens?\nPlaintiff: I didn't find out that he had titled off the car till after the incident on the 18th of October.\nJudge: And it's because he's still not giving you any money right?\nPlaintiff: I went over there to repossess the car.\nJudge: So you go over there and what happens?\nPlaintiff: As I'm driving up there as I could see the car had a flat tire from the back and it just so happens he was - him and his wife were about to leave. Well that's when he saw me and he chased me down and I stopped.\nJudge: Did he think you had flattened his tires?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: And you drove there with who to repossess the car?\nPlaintiff: Nobody just me and my dog.\nJudge: Well how was your dog going to drive the other car?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: So then how are you going to repossess the car?\nPlaintiff: I was going to have a tow truck come and pick it up. I need the address.\nJudge: He walks out to his car he's steamed and sees you - you're the guy who's mad at him for not paying and he sort of assumes that maybe tires - that's what he thinks. Kind of what I think too apparently it's what Douglas thinks cause he's chuckling. Yes it does but at the same time I mean anyway so go on.\nPlaintiff: So we have a little dispute. He's angry and he kicks my car.\nJudge: What's the dispute you're in the car or out of the car?\nPlaintiff: I'm sitting in my car I told him something I'm like well you haven't paid paid me nothing all you have to do just pay me something 10 $20 I don't feel like a fool something like that.\nJudge: Right and it just got sometimes when you do a good deed you just got to do it and forget it. And by the way did you get him in writing on that it was a loan?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: Okay is there anything else you could have possibly done wrong?\nPlaintiff: I don't know.\nJudge: Well don't get it in writing pick the wrong person you don't know him at all right and then he ends up kicking your door in doesn't he tell me about that.\nPlaintiff: Well he kicks my door and at that point I call 911.\nJudge: Okay can I see the pictures of the door and while you're looking for that what's going on?\nDefendant: What really happened was basically that he did buy me the car and he was trying to help me out in a troubling time and I mean yes like he said it was his idea it was never my idea in the first place.\nJudge: And basically you jumped at it.\nDefendant: I mean you wouldn't jump at a free car especially...\nJudge: Is it a free car or is it a car you're supposed to eventually pay back for?\nDefendant: A free car really really.\nJudge: They barely know you why they gonna give you a car?\nDefendant: I mean you barely know me why would you loan me some money?\nJudge: That mean but according to him he fronted you money so that you could have this car and then start paying him and he's certainly acting like a guy who you said you would pay because he keeps texting you and hounding you about the money and then shows up about the money and then probably slashes your tires about the money so it sounds like you fully told them you'd be paying back and didn't. Would you loan a casual acquaintance money for a car?\nDefendant: No never.\nJudge: No they were really in Need?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: You would just not do it you just tell them sorry?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: Okay hard but smart going inside the courtroom.\nDefendant: No it wasn't like that at all ma'am but it was just like basically like I said he was trying to help me out in the troubling time and he did some weeks pass and he was like George's car is having this problem.\nJudge: And George is who?\nDefendant: Your good friend?\nDefendant: It's his son. We not too much of friends right now because of all this.\nJudge: But you weren't even that that close of friends.\nDefendant: I mean he honestly he was he's a good friend.\nJudge: You said you had one text let me see the text that you have.\nPlaintiff: This was prior to the 18th when we had the fallout and he text me on the October the 16th stating he was going to take a title loan on the car and give it to me and that's pretty much what it's saying. If it was a gift why would he even give me any money?\nDefendant: I'm trying to see who will give me the most money for it and give you that and talk about the next step from there.\nJudge: Why do you do that if it's a gift?\nDefendant: Because like I said I told him I give him what I can.\nJudge: Why it's a gift why do you have to give him anything?\nDefendant: Basically because I didn't want to leave him in a stuck out situation like cuz he didn't leave me in a stuck out situation and it's like goes around comes back around so I wanted to make sure I put that in effect.\nJudge: No truer words have been spoken what goes around comes back around and it's about to come back around because I think you are a liar. I think you were supposed to pay back that money you went out and got a title loan didn't you?\nDefendant: Basically hold on.\nJudge: And you put the money where?\nDefendant: No it was on the 14th I had barely got the title on.\nJudge: Let me ask you a question why'd you kick the door in?\nDefendant: Because of the fact that he was coming trying to attack me he tried to get out the car the maintenance man and the management scene that we got into altercation after he tried to hitting my wife so what would you do?\nJudge: Okay well I wouldn't be in this position but okay so if that's what happens I need you to prove it because your credibility is garbage around here right now so if there's all these other witnesses who saw that you should have no problem call your first witness.\nDefendant: I can't exactly.\nJudge: So with someone else I might be able to stand there and say well he sounds talking I'm talking but with you I can't. Okay okay well how much it cost you to fix the tires though cuz I don't I do think slash them.\nDefendant: It was only $30.\nJudge: And deducting $30 from your recovery let me see the report of what it's going to cost to fix the door.\nDefendant: Let me say this - I was going to sign the car back over to him the first day I got the title loan and the reason why I didn't give him the $300 because I knew I was going to give him the car after the incident happened out of rage out of anger because of the fact that he disrespected me.\nJudge: He doesn't want the car what he wants is the money because I believe that is what your agreement was. We're done do not talk again. Okay I find in favor of the plaintiff in this case and the entire amount you're asking for except for the 30 bucks that it cost to patch the tires - $2,782.23 verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendent", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection , evasion,minimization, gaslighting"}

She's like, \"Oh, I talked to this guy, like he seems very legitimate.

I shouldn't have, but like, I don't know how to explain to you my situation.

I bought her brakes.\n\nDefendant: There was a problem with the body control module, which is a computer to make it start with the key.\n\nDefendant: I bought that.\n\nDefendant: I was willing to put it in, but physically can't put it in because a dealer needs to program it to that number for the car so it will run.\n\nDefendant: I went to the dealer, told her I was at the dealer, we made a plan—I sat there for two hours.\n\nDefendant: She never showed up.\nJudge: Okay, so you’re telling me that you had agreed to fix the brakes and the body control module?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: But you never agreed to a transmission warranty?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And you’re saying this document is forged?\n\nDefendant: Absolutely. That’s not my handwriting.\n\nJudge: Janice, where did this document come from?\n\nPlaintiff: He gave it to me when we made the transaction.\n\nJudge: Do you have any other proof that he promised you a transmission warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, my mom was there, and she heard him say it.\n\nJudge: Is your mother here today?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she couldn’t come.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happened with the car?\n\nPlaintiff: About three weeks after I bought it, the transmission started acting up. It wouldn’t shift properly, and then one day, it just stopped moving.\n\nJudge: Did you take it to a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and he told me the transmission was bad.\n\nJudge: Did you contact the defendant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and he said it wasn’t his problem.\n\nDefendant: That’s right, because I never sold her a warranty. She bought a used car.\n\nJudge: Janice, did you have any paperwork from the mechanic confirming the transmission was faulty?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here’s the report.\n\nJudge: (Reviews document) Okay, this says the transmission had a severe fluid leak.\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know about that.\n\nDefendant: Because she never maintained it!\n\nJudge: Do you have proof that the car had a fluid leak before she bought it?\n\nDefendant: No, but I know it didn’t leak when I had it.\n\nJudge: So this comes down to whether or not there was an actual warranty.\n\nJudge: Janice, I don’t see enough proof that there was a written or verbal warranty for the transmission.\n\nPlaintiff: But he lied to me!\n\nJudge: I understand that you’re upset, but when you buy a used car, it’s your responsibility to get it inspected beforehand.\n\nJudge: And without clear proof that he agreed to cover the transmission, I can’t rule in your favor.\n\nJudge: My judgment is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, emotional appeal, evasion"}
{"id": "941", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hand. Be seated. Come, please. Let against happen. Thank you, Douglas. Antoinette Martin, you are neighbors with Mr. Coleman, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How long have you been neighbors?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I've been in my home for more than 20 years. I believe he's been my neighbor for three.\n\nJudge: Okay, now there's a tree in question that you are quite angry about. What happened? What, according to you, did he do?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so one evening in February, I drove into my driveway, and I'm sitting in the car talking, and Mr. Coleman approached my vehicle and he said, \"Well, the tree on the right is okay. I just want to cut the branches off of it that are hanging over to my property.\" And then he said, \"The tree on the left side is dead.\" He said, \"I had someone come and look at the tree, and they told me it would cost $1,700 to take the tree down, and it would cost $800 to remove the branches.\"\n\nPlaintiff: And so I said to Mr. Coleman, \"I will need to speak to my husband and other people. I'm not sure that tree is dead. I need to take a look at it.\" He said, \"Okay, I'll see you on Monday.\" Monday came and went. I never saw Mr. Coleman again. He didn't say anything to anybody. I spoke to my husband and my parents, and we all agreed that the tree was not dead.\n\nJudge: How does anybody know without—\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it's wintertime.\n\nJudge: The fact that there are no leaves in wintertime is not how someone determines whether a tree is dead. You scrape and see if there’s green where you scrape, or you have a tree guy tell you. Did you tell him no, I don’t want the tree removed, or you didn’t say anything?\n\nPlaintiff: We didn’t see each other, so I didn’t say anything.\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: So by Friday of that week, it was February 15th, when I came home, it was dark, but I looked in the backyard and I saw that the tree was cut down.\n\nJudge: All right, so what happened?\n\nDefendant: Okay, um, first off, it wasn’t the first time I had gone to Mrs. Martin. Prior to that, I had had a gate removed, and I went to Mrs. Martin as well as some of the other adjacent neighbors and told them I was going to replace the fence.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And they all approved it, and they were actually happy. Now, this tree actually stands on the property line.\n\nJudge: On the property line?\n\nDefendant: Yes. And when putting up the new fence, the fence personnel had to actually go around the trees.\n\nJudge: Really? They had to, or they did?\n\nDefendant: They had to avoid them by going around and encroaching back onto my property to avoid the trees. So I had the right at that point to trim the trees as far as their trunks that were obscuring the line. I didn’t do that, just out of courtesy. I left them as is. But upon living there for two and a half years, I noticed that every other day, debris and branches were falling onto my driveway, my side door—where I have to use to access my home. My child accesses the backyard and the side yard. So it’s a danger in terms of property and in terms of people. So that’s when I said, \"You know what, I’m going to trim the trees, just what hangs over my line.\"\n\nJudge: Do you have anything from an arborist saying the tree was dead?\n\nDefendant: Correct, no.\n\nJudge: If you do, then show it to me. Do you have anything from an arborist saying the tree was dead?\n\nDefendant: Not anything in writing, no.\n\nJudge: Well, how are you going to prove that?\n\nDefendant: Well, again, I have the receipt from—\n\nJudge: No, no, that proves you paid X to remove it. That doesn’t prove it was dead and that’s why you removed it. This is the tree?\n\nPlaintiff: That is the tree.\n\nJudge: Do we have a picture of this tree before it became a post?\n\nPlaintiff: I have it in Google Maps.\n\nJudge: Okay, but I can’t—what you see there is a tree that’s on the neighbor’s property that is, in fact, dead, and they removed it. You want to go over there and show me what you’re saying?\n\nPlaintiff: Sure.\n\nJudge: All right, let's take a look at the images. You said you have a photo from Google Maps?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do. Right here.\n\nJudge: All right. Let me see. [Judge examines the image] This image is from when?\n\nPlaintiff: This is from last year.\n\nJudge: And this shows the tree in question?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, this is the tree that was cut down.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, Mr. Coleman, do you have any photographic evidence showing the tree was dead or hazardous before removal?\n\nDefendant: I don’t have any personal photos, but I do have the invoice from the tree service.\n\nJudge: Yes, but the invoice only shows payment for removal. It does not establish that the tree was dead.\n\nDefendant: Correct, but the tree service worker verbally confirmed to me that the tree was in bad shape.\n\nJudge: Did you get a written statement from them?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Ms. Martin, do you have any pictures of the tree closer to the time it was removed?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I wasn’t expecting it to be cut down, so I didn’t take any photos.\n\nJudge: Understood. Based on the evidence presented, my verdict in this case is for the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: But he cut down my tree without permission!\n\nJudge: Yes, but as the tree was on the property line, and there is reasonable belief it posed a danger, I find that the defendant’s actions were not malicious.

{"id": "407", "dialogue": "\n\n**Plaintiff: Kimberly Schn**  \nShe says she was in a good financial situation after she got divorced and helped out the defendant, who was like family to her. However, the defendant took advantage of her generosity. She gave multiple loans exceeding $10,000, yet the defendant repaid only $25. She is heartbroken but insists that money is money, and she is here suing for the state maximum of $5,000 in an attempt to recover at least half of her losses.\n\n**Defendant: Tanya Adler Carabo**  \nShe says this is crazy and claims that the plaintiff was a generous woman who liked spending on those less fortunate. Over the years, the plaintiff did many things for her, including taking her to dinners and hosting parties at her house. They were just like family. However, once the plaintiff got married, she became jealous and angry because the defendant was no longer as available. She insists that the lawsuit is motivated by jealousy and states that $5,000 is an insane amount to be suing for because she owes nothing.\n\n---\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please stand. Are you ready? Please be seated and come to order. Has the defendant been sworn?\n\n**Court Clerk:** Yes, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas. You're welcome. Kimberly Schn, you are suing Frank Cabalo and Tanya Adler Carabo. You have power of attorney, so Frank will not be here. You are suing for $5,000 for multiple loans you claim you made to them and that they refuse to repay you. What’s going on?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I met them probably around 2011. I met Frankie first, and we were friends for a while. Then, I met Tanya, and they became a couple. We spent time together, became very close with their kids and family—we were like family. They had financial difficulties, and they would ask to borrow money now and then. Sometimes they repaid a little bit, but over the years, I was essentially paying all their bills monthly.\n\n**Judge:** But why were you doing that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because I'm an idiot. They were like family, and I genuinely believed they would pay me back.\n\n**Judge:** How many years passed without them paying you back? Didn’t that show you they weren’t going to?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The problem was Frankie kept in contact. He would reach out and say, \"I have $25 for you here, $25 there.\" As recently as 2017, he made a small payment. The last time I saw him was about eight months ago when we got together with some friends. I still love the kids and the family with all my heart. This is very painful.\n\n**Judge:** What caused the rift between you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Around Christmas, I had gifts for the kids, but I ended up in the ER due to health issues. They wanted me to mediate an argument between them, but I told them I was at the ER. They didn’t believe me. When I got home, I found them snooping around my backyard, looking in my house to see if I was really home.\n\n**Judge:** They wanted you to mediate an argument between them?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And what happened when you saw them?\n\n**Plaintiff:** They ran away. Later, they accused me of lying about going to the hospital and cut off communication with me.\n\n**Judge:** Tanya, what do you have to say?\n\n**Defendant:** The only truth in what she said is that she is generous and kind. I never asked her for money. Her famous line was always, \"I got you, darling, no problem.\" The only person who asked her for money was my husband—$1,200, around 2013 or 2014. He kept in contact with her after we stopped being friends.\n\n**Judge:** When did you stop being friends?\n\n**Defendant:** Around 2014.\n\n**Judge:** That long ago? She says you owe her around $10,000, but the statutory maximum is $5,000. What do you say to that?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t owe her anything. I never asked her for money.\n\n**Judge:** Did you accept financial help from her?\n\n**Defendant:** She took me and my family out to dinners, paid for trips, and invited us to events.

{"id": "159", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Robert Aguilar, and you've asked us not to mention your company name. Oh, pity, it's such a cute name. All right, and your company—you own a what kind of company?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): It’s a restoration deck restoration company.\n\nJudge: Okay. You are suing Carol Lloyd, a former client who, according to you, refuses to pay a remaining balance of $1,749. According to you, you've paid them more than enough for what they've done so far. Okay, let's start with you, Mr. Aguilar. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): We, uh, I got a call from Mrs. Lloyd back on April 3rd to have an estimate done. At that time, the estimate called for basically doing some work on her deck, cleaning her deck, and applying a stain or refinishing the deck. Uh, through the process, I gave her the estimate. Here's a copy of it.\n\nJudge: And that estimate was for $785?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): That is correct, and that included only washing, prepping, and staining the deck.\n\nJudge: That is correct, all right, and checking the supports for the hot tub to go on?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, because you wanted to have a hot tub.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Yes. And how long had you been looking into having a hot tub?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Well, I turned—was turning 60, so I said to myself, this is going to be a good 60th birthday gift, so I started to go around, but then they were having the, uh, the, uh, home expo show with the vendors at Nassau Coliseum and I said, that's a good place to go, and that’s where I first met Mr. Aguilar.\n\nJudge: Oh, so you were actually looking for a hot tub when you met him?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right, and you wanted to have your deck all spruced up first and make sure it could support it?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you give her the estimate for $785, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): She said she wanted to go ahead with the work. I received the contract back agreeing to the terms and conditions back on April 5th.\n\nJudge: Now this contract, which is the one you ultimately sign, is for $1,564, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Right.\n\nJudge: Let me see the copy of the contract. She had added additional work to the contract, and the additional work that she added was to wash the PVC fence for $120, to wash the house for $385, and to put support beams for the hot tub to the tune of $150, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. When Mr. Aguilar came out the first time, he said, I have to inspect before I write up a proposal, so he went down on his hands and knees. He was able to look under to say to me this support will hold it, this support will be fine for the hot tub.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): All right. Well, let’s put that to a side, like whose fault it is that there ends up becoming a problem. And you can't just put this a PO in a— in a— um, in the end, what happens is that when you send an employee out there to do that part of the work, what does the employee actually say to you?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Uh, he had taken off the boards. I was in the house, and my old boards because we’re fixing some new boards, and he calls me outside. He goes, look, you cannot put a hot tub on this, even with new boards on here. He goes, it’s dangerous. I won’t do it.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): So I said, no, no, safety—you know, of course, hold up. And, um, he told me he spoke to Bob about this, was held up.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): So he tells you what she says, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Correct.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Once he took off the boards, he noticed that per code you’re supposed to bolt them into the house. They weren’t bolted. They were just nailed into the house.\n\nJudge: Okay, now, was this deck illegally built, yes or no?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you know who it was built by, or that was before you?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): No, no, that was after me. Had extension put done. There was a deck out there. He worked off the underneath old deck and just put a new wood on everything.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): What are you doing now? You try? Did you get the hot tub?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): No, you got to get the hot tub?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Yes, I had to do it. What happened was, I had to get a survey done so that the engineer can go to the town, we filed, yep, get everything done for the work that you did in an unpermitted fashion that we turned out to not be worth the money, right?\n\nJudge: So the cheap comes out expensive, honey.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): You got that right.\n\nJudge: Now, you got to pay for it twice.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Add that to the little price of doing it right the first time.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Now, apparently, according to you, you have this contract, which is $1,564, and then there she adds additional work. What is the additional work?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The additional work was she wanted some boards to be replaced on the top of the deck, having nothing to do with support beams, having nothing to support. In fact, I have a detailed breakdown of the work that was done and what was not done and in the letter. Let me tell you what I want: a detailed contract of the new work that she ordered agreeing to the price that you are suing for.\n\nJudge: No, as far as that, within the contract, it states if you read it, it says any additional work not mentioned within this work, this contract, will be at additional cost.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Well, that doesn’t need—\n\nJudge: Of course, so now what I’m asking you is show me the change order.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Right. There was no change order at that time because my men did not have a change order at that time. They called.\n\nJudge: Seriously, they need to have shoelaces, and they need to have a change order inside the truck. And if they don’t, they need to have a crayon and a roll of toilet paper. And if you’re the boss, you drive over to where someone’s run out of change orders and you get a legal pad and a pen.\n\nJudge: What’s the real answer for why you didn’t get a contract? You goofed, and your people goofed.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The Plaintiff was hired to power wash and stain her deck and didn’t get paid. The problem is he didn’t get a complete contract. Let’s listen.\n\nJudge: All right, how much extra work—what is the extra work that he’s talking about?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The additional boards that were really weathered or beat up, if you will. So he put down another additional eight boards.\n\nJudge: Eight boards. Okay, and was there a price agreed upon for the eight boards?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): I, as I remember it on the phone, it was like $35 for one board, $35 for the actual board, and what for the labor?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): No, $25 for the board or $15 for the labor. I agree to it, whatever, you know.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Well, what was it? Was it $685 like he says?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): I don’t think that math is going to work out to $685. That would work out to $280.\n\nJudge: All right, so what was it?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): See, this is why we have to have contracts in the true... but we’ve had Miss Lloyd and us have had a great relationship except for—\n\nJudge: You deny $685, or you don’t deny? Are you sure, or you’re not sure?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): No, no. I deny the $685 or the $235, whatever it is—the additional boards.\n\nJudge: Do you know what the additional boards were going to cost you?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): No.\n\nJudge: How could you just say, “Go ahead and do a job” without knowing what it’s going to cost you?\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Well, to be honest with you, he did say it over the phone. I don’t know if it was $35 or—\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): How much was the board?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): We charge $6 per foot for the repairs.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Now, before they left, she knew the price, and all along this time, I was never contacted disputing price, disputing anything from Miss Lloyd.\n\nJudge: Did you get any correspondence from her at all talking about, \"I'm just having money problems. Give me some time,\" anything like that?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): No.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): What I did is I went personally to her home to want to deliver the stain and second, I wanted to see what was going on with the deck.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): No.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Uh, the stain, the ref, here's what happens, okay? Your guy tells you, we can’t do the reinforcing part, which is really what she definitely wanted for the hot tub. So what work of the original contract did you guys complete?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The house wash was completed.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The PVC fencing was done.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The washing of the deck was done.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Accurate.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): The repairs of the boards were done.\n\nDefendant (Carol Lloyd): Okay, so the thing was just not accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Robert Aguilar): Not the repair of the boards were done.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection Dismissal Evasion Minimization"}

You intentionally left your job?\r\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am, I did. I had enough money in savings to still provide for my child and still provide medical insurance.\r\nPlaintiff: So I felt that, you know, the stress of my divorce wasn't inhibiting me from performing my job.\r\nJudge: Okay, okay.\r\nJudge: Okay, okay, first of all.\r\nJudge: That's a different court.\r\nJudge: We're not here to talk about anything that went on with the divorce. I just need to know about the money that you're making because obviously the child lives with you. Is that correct, sir?\r\nLawyer: I'M NOT SURE.\r\nJudge: So,\r\nJudge: You have all this money and saving, let's talk about it.\r\nLawyer: Let's talk about it.\r\nJudge: How much did you make at your last job?\r\nPlaintiff: Annually, $70,000.\r\nJudge: $70,000, okay.\r\nJudge: And that's your only job?\r\nPlaintiff: It was my only job.

You already said that once and we moved on from that.\r\nJudge: So,\r\nJudge: You're now making $30,000 a year.\r\nJudge: and you think that I should base child support on $30,000 instead of the $70,000 that you intentionally stopped working at?\r\nPlaintiff: Well that is my annual income now.\r\nJudge: That's your annual income now. When did you stop working at your corporate job?\r\nPlaintiff: A year ago.\r\nJudge: A year ago.

Ma'am, I'm gonna make you pay child support.\r\nJudge: You came obviously in this courtroom to waste my time.\r\nPlaintiff: to waste my time.\r\nPlaintiff: I have a question. How come I have to get a corporate job? How come he can't get a corporate job?\r\nJudge: He can get a job, but the child lives with him, right?\r\nPlaintiff: Yes, and I think the reason why the child is even with him to begin with is because of, well, this is a different court.

I'm making $30,000 a year now.\r\nJudge: You're making $30,000 a year now, but ma'am, you intentionally work at a job that pays you less. And you think that you're going to come in this courtroom and get me to order that you pay a less amount when you're capable of making the $70,000 with a master's degree? You made that up.\r\nPlaintiff: I don't know emotional distress is intentional.\r\nJudge: Emotional distress is intentional. Excuse me, emotional distress. I need you to go see a doctor.

{"id": "600", "dialogue": "Judge:\nOkay, Mr. Lee, you are suing your neighbor, Mr. Alaat?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nFor $297 in vet bills that you have already incurred and will incur because according to you his dog attacked your dog?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nThat’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nTell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nUm, may I use the…?\n\nJudge:\nSure.\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nOkay, I want everybody to see, this is where I live. Okay, this is where Mr. Alaat lives. This is the fire hydrant, that’s where I walked my dog. I walked my dog to the fire hydrant. That's where he decided to pee. I was standing there watching him. And then a shadow came out of nowhere, and grabbed my dog.\n\nJudge:\nIs your dog on a leash?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nThe dog was on a leash. I tried to pull him, but in that split second I didn’t know what it was. Then I realized when he was crying, it was a big dog. I jumped on him.\n\nJudge:\nDid you let go of the leash?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nI let go of the leash. I jumped on the big dog, tried to pull him back, but he knocked me off and attacked my dog again. So I jumped on the dog again and grabbed hold of him. Then Mr. Alaat came running and said, “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know. I was watching my dog in front of my yard.\" He disappeared, but I didn’t know where he went until I heard the commotion.\n\nJudge:\nGo ahead and go back. Is your dog alive?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat kind of dog do you have?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nMy dog is a Pomeranian, about 10 lbs.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what kind of dog do you have?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI have a Boxer.\n\nJudge:\nHow many pounds?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nMaybe 60 lbs.\n\nJudge:\nAnd was your dog off a leash?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nBecause it was in the house and Mr. Lee was working with his dog. He said his dog was on a leash, but he was not on a leash. I heard some voice, and as soon as I opened the door, my dog came out and jumped on his dog because his dog was urinating on my bushes in front of my yard.\n\nJudge:\nSo, according to you, it happened in your front yard, right in front of you?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nThat’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you say to him when this happened?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI don’t understand.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did he say to you right when it happened?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nWhen it happened, he said, “I’m sorry, I was watching my dog,” and then he disappeared. I didn’t know where he went until I heard the commotion.\n\nJudge:\nWhat else did he say?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nWell, at that time, I took my dog back to see what damage was done. I saw there were puncture wounds and some bite wounds. I went back to his house and showed him, \"Look what your dog did, there’s a puncture wound here, some bites there.\" I saw his wife slap him on the shoulder and they were speaking in their language.\n\nJudge:\nDid your wife beat you?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDid she smack you? Was she frustrated with you for some reason?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nNo, why would she?\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what happened next?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nWell, I asked where the emergency hospital was. His daughter said, \"Go find a hospital, we’ll pay for the entire cost.\"\n\nJudge:\nHow old’s your daughter?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI don’t know.\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nShe’s 32.\n\nJudge:\nA grown woman?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nYes. She went with him and paid $200 with a credit card.\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes.\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI told him to go to my vet. He took the dog to my vet, and my vet said, “Your dog is in bad shape, we need to give him an IV, we need surgery.” He gave a quote of $1,000.\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes, they said my dog needed surgery, and then they quoted $1,000. But when I went to the emergency clinic, they quoted a price of $900 to $1,100.\n\nJudge:\nSo, did you have the surgery done with your vet?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes, I did.\n\nJudge:\nAnd according to the vet, the dog’s hip was dislocated from the attack and needed to be fixed. Was that another $1,800?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you go back and tell Mr. Alaat it’s going to be $2,900?\n\nPlaintiff (Mr. Lee):\nYes, and all of a sudden, your dog’s off a leash, and it happened on my property.\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI didn’t pay for it. My daughter paid the $200. She came back and said, “Dad, I want to solve this problem,” so I paid $200 with my credit card.\n\nJudge:\nSo, why did you offer to pay for the damages to the dog?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nActually, he’s my neighbor. I felt bad, so I offered to help. If my neighbor had a car accident, I wouldn’t run out and pay for all the damages.\n\nJudge:\nBut the fact is, it happened on your property, and your dog was off leash.\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nYes, but I didn’t want this situation to escalate. I didn’t want to leave him high and dry.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you tell him to go to your vet?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI explained to him that my vet would give him a discount.\n\nJudge:\nBut your vet didn’t give him a better price.\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nNo, my vet quoted a higher price.\n\nJudge:\nIt’s a tough case for you, but especially if his dog was on a leash and yours wasn’t. I can see how it would have been difficult for Mr. Lee to avoid the situation.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Alaat? Why didn’t you just pay when it was a reasonable price?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Alaat):\nI tried, but the bill kept increasing.\n\nJudge:\nI believe the dog was on a leash. I believe your dog was off leash, and I believe your dog attacked his. You just didn’t want to pay because it was so expensive. That’s not a defense. I’m finding in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $297.\n\nJudge:\nGood luck, folks.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Emotional Appeal, Deflection, Minimization"}
{"id": "376", "dialogue": "Judge: \"Joseph Wheeler, you are suing Julianne Delo and Brock More for $3,179.82 that you say they owe you in back rent and fees. Tell me what's going on?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"My wife and I own a travel agency in Orlando, Florida, and we also have some rental property. About the second week in August of 2010, I advertised the property. They moved in, and what goes wrong?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"Approximately two weeks after they moved in, they contacted me and said that there were a few little issues they'd like to have cleared up. The biggest of which was they wanted the bathroom tile to be regrouted. I regrouted the entire bathroom. At that time, I had them initial paragraph five on the lease stating they had checked it out thoroughly and everything was in good repair and order. Everything seemed to be fine for approximately eight months. At that time, they called me and said they were having a problem with some mice. I notified them that underneath the terms of the lease, it was the tenant's responsibility to take care of extermination, although I would come over and set some bait traps. I did that, and then a couple of weeks later, they contacted me and said that their kitchen drawer had broken. I have some photographs. I mean, it didn't just break. It was destroyed.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"One of those photographs... These are the photographs of the kitchen drawer, and I basically had to rebuild it.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"And they had a leak underneath the bathroom sink. Did they say how it had—\"\n\nJudge: \"They did not.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"I’m not sure.\"\n\nJudge: \"Why are you implying they did something wrong?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"Well, it’s a little bit more than just pulling the drawer and having the face pop off. I don't know. That's obvious to me from what I'm seeing.\"\n\nJudge: \"Okay, go ahead.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"And they had a couple of other little issues that needed to be attended to. Everything was fine. It was April 25th, they called me and said they had a problem with the toilet flushing properly. I went over, inspected it, and the main line was clogged up. I rented a plumbing snake, cleared the main line, everything was fine for about 3 weeks. Then they called me again, very irate, in the middle of the night stating that the commode was backed up again. It was overflowing. The next morning, I cleared the line again with another snake.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"Yes, I rented it again. I have the receipts. And then I discovered that she was flushing her feminine products down the commode.\"\n\nJudge: \"You do understand that that's actually the manufacturer-suggested way of disposal, right? Like that’s actually how it’s done unless there’s a reason that you can’t, like you have old plumbing, which could happen. And then you just have to tell a woman, right? You just have to let her know. But had you ever—\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"I hadn’t specifically told them that, no.\"\n\nJudge: \"No? That I recall.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"But it is in the lease. It states that any blockage of the main sewer line will be their responsibility.\"\n\nJudge: \"So you then tell them, ‘I am going to charge you for this’?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"Correct, for clearing the sewer line.\"\n\nJudge: \"And how much are you going to charge them for that?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"$64.91 times two.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"They also had repairs that were agreed to under the lease if anything was under $75.\"\n\nJudge: \"What repair are you referring to?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"The kitchen drawer and the repairs underneath the sink.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Joseph Wheeler): \"You know, in that lease.

{"id": "482", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plate of Amina Hosaini. She says her father rented a home from the defendant, and when they moved in, the water was brown and dirty. The landlord had it tested, and it was determined they would need to change the filter every month. When they moved out, the sneaky defendant deducted the cost of the testing, the plumber, and some other unfair things from their security, and she’s here to fight for her rights and a full refund of the $1,159.48 that the defendant owes her.\n\nThis is the defendant, Raymond Shalo. He says he lived in that house for 18 years and never had a problem with the water being clean. He told the plaintiff that if she wanted to get it tested, she'd have to pay for it, and she agreed. The tests proved the water was indeed clean and pure. When the plaintiff moved out, she clogged up the septic system with grease and sludge. He deducted the cost to fix this problem, and the water testing owes her nothing and feels the judge will side with him.\n\nJudge: All parties, please rise. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in the docket: The plaintiff’s dad rented a house from the defendant, and the water was brown and dirty, and she had to pay for the filter. But the defendant says the water was good from the get-go. It's the case of how now brown water, you dog.\n\nJudge: Okay, Hosaini... you are representing CIA, yes?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, your father?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes.\n\nJudge: Here today in this lawsuit against the landlord for a return of the remainder of your security deposit. The landlord is Raymond Shalo.\n\nJudge: Yes, okay, and you kept $1,159.48 of the security deposit for damages that you say they are responsible for. Let me hear from you first, Amina. Go ahead, Miss Hosaini.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): So I’ll start out with the solar bill that was on there.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you rented a house that belonged to him. How long were you living there?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): We rented from July 22nd of 2017 to August 1st of 2018.\n\nJudge: Okay, and during the time that you lived there, did you have any complaints?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): There were lots. Okay, one of the complaints you had was when you first moved in, the water was brown.\n\nJudge: Yes, do you have a video of that?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Okay, that I put into evidence. We have that.\n\nJudge: Okay, this is your video?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes.\n\nJudge: What am I looking at there?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): So that is the filter thing that went onto the... so it's dark because it's filled with the cup that’s on the top.\n\nJudge: What is that, a cup? Is that the thing that looks like a cup with a jar?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): That's where the filter goes into it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you pull it out and it was full of that soot that you're showing.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes, so that filter on the bottom is not supposed to be that dark, and then the stuff that still pours out of it after the filter's out.\n\nJudge: Alright, so when you first moved in, you asked to have the water tested because you’re seeing the water to be very... that video was taken afterwards, though. That's not...\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yeah, that was one of the... you don’t have a video of the water and the color that it was.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Well, I have one of the pictures that I put in this. It was like when you would open the faucet, the water would be this brown.\n\nJudge: May I see that picture?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Sure.\n\nJudge: And in here are text messages from Mr. Chillu that he had Mr. Rob Anderson coming to look at it. Who is Mr. Rob Anderson?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): He’s my best friend.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you did get it tested?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes.\n\nJudge: And what do you find? Do you have the results of the testing?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes, I do. May I see?\n\nJudge: May I say something about that film that was shown before?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Yeah, that's a sediment filter that's to take the sediment out of the water so it doesn't go into the faucet and the toilets and stuff like that. It’s supposed to look like that.\n\nJudge: Parameters analyzed are below the drinking water maximum contamination levels established by the Connecticut State Health Department. Alright, so that takes place on September 3rd, 2017. You don’t move till when?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): We moved out August 1st of 2018.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you ever once, between September 3rd of 2017 and August when they moved out, ask them to pay for this?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes, I told Mr. Anderson if she ever asked for... why Mr. Anderson? Is he your property manager?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yeah, more or less.\n\nJudge: Come on up, front and center.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend (Mr. Rob Anderson): Okay.\n\nJudge: Go ahead, what were you saying?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend (Mr. Rob Anderson): I told him... Mr. Chillu, if she ever asked, you know, yeah, wanted to see the results of the test and stuff, that she had to pay for it because she agreed to pay for that.\n\nJudge: She agreed to pay for it?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you have any proof that she agreed to pay for the water test?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): No, it's just verbal. There's no text or emails or anything else. We're just speaking over the...\n\nJudge: Okay, what did you want to add there?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend (Mr. Rob Anderson): Me and Mr. Chillu always spoke over text. As you can see, I have every single document, like conversation we had. So if that was... if that’s what he’s claiming, then that should be in the text, and there’s nothing in the text.\n\nJudge: Okay. So now, the next thing that he deducts is what?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): The plumbing. So because you had complained that there was a water leak, so there was literally, I think there was four leaks while we lived there.\n\nJudge: Since there’s so many leaks, why don’t we do this differently? What leak are you now saying they should have to pay for?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): This one. When... hold on.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): The December 9th... I think it was. I got a text, and it's showing me pictures of a leak downstairs in the utility room, that the pipes were leaking and stuff, so I called up my plumber and I asked him if he could go out there and fix it. He went there on Monday, he filled up the tub three times and drained it, he turned on all the faucets in the house and stuff and let him run and stayed there for an hour and a half and didn’t find any leak anywhere. Tenant complained of mystery leak. Above boiler, inspected all piping and found no leaks. I believe someone used the bath shower and did not secure the curtain.\n\nJudge: That’s the one that’s for $132.92, and that's from a plumbing repair, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes.\n\nJudge: Was there ever a problem after that, after the plumber left? Did you have to call again because the leak continued?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): No, it wasn’t the same leak again, but there was multiple leaks.\n\nJudge: Okay, but do you know if that wasn’t the only time that leak was fixed? That was the second time.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yeah.\n\nJudge: But I need you to slow down and listen a second. Hand that to my buyer, and then listen to my question.\n\nJudge: There is a plumber who is asked to come out there who comes out there December 11th, who says there's no leak. I think that they're just not putting the shower curtain inside the shower. And my question to you is: that means one of two things: you're not putting the shower curtain inside the bathtub, or he's a bad plumber and it happened again later and he just couldn’t find the leak. So if it happened again later in this same spot, show me evidence it happened again later. Do you have that?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Not after that.\n\nJudge: Let’s move on to a different issue. You have also deducted $700 for what?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): The septic. When the new homeowners came, and the buyers of the house, they had an inspection. They inspected the septic system, and they found that the pipes leading out to the leach field was loaded with grease. Why would the tenants pay that?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Because they put grease down the drain. I got evidence showing that when I had my septic tank pumped prior to that, the pipes were clean.\n\nJudge: And when did you have your septic tank pumped?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Prior to them moving in, I think it was in 2014.\n\nJudge: They move in in 2017. Who lived there between 2014 and 2017?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): I do.\n\nJudge: Okay, so I think it's going to be really hard to figure out whose sludge we’re talking about, because the only one who knows is the sludge, and the sludge ain’t talking. So how on earth are you going to persuade me that that is their expense? That’s something you had to pay because you wanted to sell the house, and the homeowners who were buying it insisted on it. The purchasers. Why would that be their problem?\n\nJudge: So can you drink brown water that goes through a filter? Is that safe?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): What are you saying?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): I definitely wouldn’t. That sounds really foul.\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): What do you say?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): There are all sorts of things I... they're using sewers now, where they filter it. I think in the area that they really necessarily need to do that, it’s okay to do it.\n\nJudge: Is it safe?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): No, it’s not safe, really. No, I wouldn’t drink it.\n\nJudge: Well, it’s amazing what they’re doing these days. Going inside the courtroom. What else did you deduct?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): The Solar City bill. Do you have the bill that came in? Because usually those bills do refer to prior usage. That should be correct.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Can I say something?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): That I was okay with. I had asked him multiple times to just send me the bill so it... it usually doesn’t come that fast. That’s part of the problem.\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Do you have it now though?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s see.  Plaintiff (Amina Hosaini): That, what happened... so when we moved out, they had a solar bill in our name, and they never gave us a clear breakdown. I kept asking for it, and they never sent me a final bill or anything.\n\nJudge: Alright, so they deducted $700 for the septic, and now you’re talking about a solar bill. How much was the solar bill?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): It was $150, but I never got a final bill for it. They kept saying that the next bill was coming, and when we moved out, I never received a final statement, so I’m disputing that as well.\n\nJudge: Okay, and that $150 is what’s being deducted?\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Yes, along with everything else they’ve deducted for the plumbing and other issues.\n\nJudge: Alright, Mr. Shalo, you’re hearing all of this. Why don’t you go ahead and respond to the claims about the water test and the plumbing.\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): Well, as far as the water goes, like I said, we had it tested, and it came back clean. There was nothing wrong with the water. And as for the plumbing, I had a plumber come in and check the system, and they didn’t find any leaks. They inspected everything thoroughly.\n\nJudge: Okay, but we’re still dealing with a situation where the water was brown when they moved in. Do you deny that?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): The water may have been a little discolored, but that’s because of the filters. It happens sometimes. But it was never unsafe. It wasn’t dangerous water. It was still drinkable.\n\nJudge: And how about the septic issue? The plaintiff says that you deducted money for a septic problem caused by grease. Is that true?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): That’s absolutely true. I had the septic tank pumped, and when the new owners came to inspect the system, they found grease in the pipes. It’s clear that it wasn’t something that happened before they moved in, because everything was clean when I last had it pumped.\n\nJudge: But you’re saying that the tenants caused it, but you can’t prove that. Can you?\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): I can’t prove it directly, but I know the pipes were clean before they moved in, and after they moved out, the system was clogged with grease.\n\nJudge: Right, but I think we’ve established that it’s hard to prove whose grease it was, and whether it was your tenants or some other factor. You can’t directly tie it to them.\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): I understand that, but I still think it was their responsibility. They didn’t take care of the system properly.\n\nJudge: Alright. So, we’re looking at a few things here. There’s the water issue, which you tested and it came back clean. The plumbing issue seems to have been resolved by a plumber who didn’t find any leaks, and the septic issue is disputed, as we can’t conclusively prove who caused the grease blockage.\n\nPlaintiff (Amina Hosaini): Your Honor, I just want to make sure that my father is treated fairly here. We paid the rent on time, and we never caused any issues. All we’re asking is for the return of the security deposit.\n\nDefendant (Raymond Shalo): I agree that they paid their rent, but there were damages, and I’m just trying to recover those costs.\n\nJudge: Alright, I have heard enough.

{"id": "327", "dialogue": "\nJudge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant's 11-year-old nephew wrecked her fence with his bike, but the defendant says they paid for the repair and aren’t paying for a new fence. It's the case of not mending fences. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Okay, Carol Gardner. Yes, you are suing Latricia Warren and  for $100, the balance left on the fixing of your fence as a result of young Mr. Pierce's negligence, according to you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: On September the 11th, 2011, I was watching the ceremony at the World Trade Center. I was listening for a name because one of my colleague’s sons had been killed. After the ceremonies, I decided to look out the front door just to look outside, and to my horror, my fence was missing its pickets. The top rail, the bottom rail—gone, laying on the—\n\nJudge: 9/11 was a horror. Your picket fence? Not so much. I think you’re a little overly dramatic, but okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, to me, it was. I mean, I was just shocked, okay? Because I had heard nothing, and I’m thinking it couldn’t have been a car because a car would have taken out the whole thing. So, in my housecoat and um, flip-flops, yes, I went out. I didn’t even get dressed. I went out and I—I said to the kids, I saw some kids down the street—I said, \"What happened?\" And many of them I know because I taught some of them.\n\nJudge: Oh, they must have been scared to death.\n\nPlaintiff: So, uh, they pointed at Christopher.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I didn’t recognize him, and I asked him, you know, \"What is your name?\" And um, \"What happened?\" And he told me.\n\nJudge: What did he tell you?\n\nPlaintiff: He said that the dirt bike ran over the fence. And, uh, that’s all he told me. So I said, \"Well, I need to see—\"\n\nJudge: Did they knock on your door after it happened?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: He was scared. He’s a kid. He’s scared. So, I said I needed to see—\n\nJudge: Christopher, what happened?\n\nDefendant (): Um, rode the dirt bike into the fence.\n\nJudge: You rode the dirt bike into the fence? How old are you?\n\nDefendant (): 13.\n\nJudge: Are you supposed to even be riding a dirt bike?\n\nDefendant (): No.\n\nJudge: Whose dirt bike was it?\n\nDefendant (): My cousin’s.\n\nJudge: Your cousin? Were you visiting your cousin?\n\nDefendant (): Mhm.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, he was visiting what relative?\n\nDefendant (): He was visiting my aunt.\n\nJudge: Your aunt. And how long was he visiting her?\n\nDefendant (): For the weekend.\n\nJudge: The weekend. Mhm. Very eventful weekend. And then the cousin lives in that house?\n\nDefendant (): Mhm.\n\nJudge: It’s your aunt’s child. And that child is how old?\n\nDefendant (): 13 now.\n\nJudge: So, he has a dirt bike?\n\nDefendant (): Mhm.\n\nJudge: Mhm. Who’s that back there?\n\nDefendant (Latricia Warren): That’s my cousin. It was her brother’s dirt bike.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, how did you lose control of the dirt bike?\n\nDefendant (): Um, the thing went out of gear.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh. Where were you riding it?\n\nDefendant (): In the street. And then I got onto the sidewalk.\n\nJudge: Right. And you kind of lost control. So, why didn’t you go knock on her door and tell her, \"Hey, um, I hate to tell you this, ma’am, but I ran into your gate.\"\n\nDefendant (): That wasn’t going to happen at 13. Uh-uh. Nope.\n\nJudge: Why not, Christopher? Why not?\n\nDefendant (): I don’t know.\n\nJudge: You were scared.\n\n[The conversation continues in similar format, discussing liability, responsibility, and ultimately concluding with the judge’s verdict.]\n\nJudge: I’m not going to issue a verdict against you because you have no parental liability in this circumstance. But I am going to issue that verdict against you, Christopher. Okay? Because you’ve admitted that that was something that you did. It’s fine. It’s an accident. But when we have accidents, we’ve got to make it right, and there’s the last $100 to make it right, right? And I’m sure that they can afford that $100, but it was important to them, I think, to make sure that you understand that you’ve got to make it right. Okay? You’re a nice young man, so go make it right. Work this summer and pay off that $100. Verdict for the plaintiff: $100. Good luck.\n\n[Final thoughts from the participants and concluding statements by the judge and courtroom commentary.]\n\nJudge: That will do it for this case.

{"id": "69", "dialogue": "JUDGE: All parties, please stand. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff hired the defendant, a process server, but the papers were never served, and he wants his money back. The defendant says he served the papers, so pound sand. It’s the case of revenge is best served in court. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, William Railly.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJUDGE: You are suing Mark. You’ve asked me to name you only by your first name and his process-serving business for $645. You want the amount you paid him returned to you. You want one day’s pay, and you want the cost that you paid a new process server. You want both those… What happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF: On or about January 25th, I contacted the defendant and his company and discussed the possibility of hiring him in regard to doing a service.\n\nJUDGE: Had you ever used him before?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I have not.\n\nJUDGE: Did he come recommended?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, someone recommended me to him. We discussed it.\n\nJUDGE: What kind of lawsuit was this?\n\nPLAINTIFF: It’s a civil court case in Queens County, vehicle accident, leaving the scene. It took a while to find out who the individual was who was responsible for the accident. We finally got that information, started the process, and hence I needed a server to proceed with it.\n\nJUDGE: And so you hire him when?\n\nPLAINTIFF: On or about January 25th, 2012. We discussed. I think the amount was $180. We agreed on that. Same date, I sent an email to him, basically sending him the copies of the documents needed to be served. I have a copy of the email if you’d like to see that.\n\nJUDGE: Yes, please.\n\nPLAINTIFF: And here’s the copy of the—\n\nJUDGE: So what goes wrong?\n\nPLAINTIFF: On or about—let me see now—\n\nJUDGE: Why does everybody say that, ‘on or about’? Y’all watch too much TV. When did you do it?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I apologize for that.\n\nJUDGE: That’s all right, everybody does it. It’s kind of funny. Go ahead.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I contacted Mr.—excuse me, the defendant—on April 6th as well as April 23rd to find out where we were in the service of the case.\n\nJUDGE: You waited that long? That was kind of patient.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I figured 120 days, give or take.\n\nJUDGE: Which is about either when it would expire or it had expired at that point, right?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Right. So I had again, as well, sent him the email asking an update or request. I have a copy of that email as well.\n\nJUDGE: Yes. Is he answering your emails?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No.\n\nJUDGE: What about phone calls?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Phone calls, I think we spoke twice on the phone. Once initially, to set up the—\n\nJUDGE: Yeah, but now are you calling him and telling him, ‘What up? I gave you this January 25th, have you served?’ Are you calling him?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Mhm.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, and no answer?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No answer.\n\nJUDGE: All right, so what do you do? You hire a different process server?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I wanted to wait and give the defendant the benefit of the doubt to see where we were.\n\nJUDGE: Doubt? The guy’s not even calling you back.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Well, that was true, but, you know, I don’t know what’s going on, so I figured let me proceed a little bit more.\n\nJUDGE: You don’t know what’s going on because he won’t let you know what’s going on.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah, that is true. On June 23rd, I receive a phone call—on June 23rd, I receive a phone call from the defendant as well as an email.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I am still awaiting payment for the service of process on [case name]. Please advise of payment as service was completed a while ago, and I have a copy of this.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, so did you say to him, ‘Dude, here are all the emails I’ve been contacting you with, and you didn’t tell me anything?’\n\nDEFENDANT: That was it.\n\nJUDGE: And I don’t understand—if service, if they’ve achieved service, don’t you have a court date?\n\nDEFENDANT: I believe the court sets the date, but I don’t know the process in which the court acts.\n\nJUDGE: How does it work?\n\nDEFENDANT: It depends on which court it is, Your Honor. Some courts will docket it very quickly and send you notification. Some courts will wait almost a year or more to give you a court date, and some will even not even give you a trial date or court date; they’ll just refer you to immediate arbitration.\n\nJUDGE: So did you serve this pro—did you?\n\nDEFENDANT: I did. I served it on April 23rd.\n\nJUDGE: That’s the date of his second reminder email to you, three months later.\n\nDEFENDANT: Well, that is correct.\n\nJUDGE: How did you serve it?\n\nDEFENDANT: I served it by personal service pursuant to New York law, by delivering it to the residence, and a person of suitable age and discretion took it on the person’s behalf.\n\nJUDGE: Who was that?\n\nDEFENDANT: That was the doorman of the building.\n\nJUDGE: The doorman? You left it with the doorman?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. That is an accepted method of service under New York law.\n\nJUDGE: Did you try serving it directly to the defendant first?\n\nDEFENDANT: I attempted to, yes. I went to the address multiple times, and she was not available.\n\nJUDGE: And you have an affidavit of service?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes, I do.\n\nJUDGE: Let me see it.\n\n[DEFENDANT hands over the document]\n\nJUDGE: [Reading] This affidavit states that you left the papers with the doorman. Did you follow up with a mailing?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes, I mailed a copy to the same address the next day, as required.\n\nJUDGE: Did you notify the plaintiff that you had served the papers?\n\nDEFENDANT: I did not immediately notify him.\n\nJUDGE: Why not?\n\nDEFENDANT: I was waiting for confirmation that everything was properly processed before reaching out.\n\nJUDGE: But he was reaching out to you, multiple times, asking about the service.\n\nDEFENDANT: I understand that, Your Honor, and I regret not responding sooner.\n\nJUDGE: Mr. Railly, when you finally got this email from the defendant, what did you do?\n\nPLAINTIFF: By that point, I had already hired another process server because I had no way of knowing if the service was actually done.\n\nJUDGE: Did the second process server successfully serve the papers?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, and they provided immediate confirmation.\n\nJUDGE: Okay. So, Mr. Mark, why should he pay for a service that he had to redo because you failed to communicate?\n\nDEFENDANT: Your Honor, I did perform the service. It was completed, and I have the affidavit to prove it.\n\nJUDGE: But you didn't communicate that to your client. He was left in the dark. Do you understand why that’s a problem?\n\nDEFENDANT: I do, but the service was legally completed.\n\nJUDGE: That’s not the issue. The issue is whether he got what he paid for—a timely, professional service that kept him informed. And from what I’m seeing here, he didn’t.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Exactly.\n\nJUDGE: I’ve heard enough. Here’s my ruling…\n\nJUDGE: Mr. Mark, you were paid to perform a service. The service includes not only the act of delivering the papers but also keeping the client informed. You failed in that regard.\n\nDEFENDANT: But the papers were served, Your Honor.\n\nJUDGE: That’s not enough. Your client had no confirmation of that service. He repeatedly contacted you, and you ignored him. He had no choice but to hire someone else. That means he paid twice for something he only needed once.\n\nPLAINTIFF: That’s exactly my issue.\n\nJUDGE: And it’s a valid one. Mr. Railly hired you in good faith. You did the job but failed to inform him, which left him in an impossible position. That’s negligence on your part.\n\nDEFENDANT: Your Honor, I understand, but I didn’t intentionally ignore him.\n\nJUDGE: Intent isn’t the issue. The outcome is. The question before me is whether he is entitled to a refund. Since he had to pay someone else for the same service due to your lack of communication, the answer is yes.\n\nDEFENDANT: But—\n\nJUDGE: I am ordering you to refund the plaintiff $645. That covers the original service fee, the cost of hiring a second process server, and his lost wages for the wasted time.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJUDGE: Judgment for the plaintiff.

{"id": "23", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Miss Hicks, you are suing the furniture company you’ve asked us not to mention the company’s name, represented here by Miss Monroe. What’s your role in the company?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): I’m co-owner.\n\nJudge: Okay, for $1,000 that you paid them for a leather sofa and love seat that according to you isn’t what you ordered. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Okay, on May 3rd I went to the defendant’s furniture store to purchase a nice sofa and love seat in the amount of $1,000, and he gave me a receipt, paid in full for $1,000, and then he delivered it. When he delivered it on May 15th, is the one that he delivered the one that was in the showroom?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): No, the one he delivered me was the one I looked at in the showroom.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Yeah, yeah, but typically what happens is the showroom one is a model and then they order a new one for you, that’s what you want. But you're not happy with the one that arrived at your house and why?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Because two weeks later I noticed that the leather was crumping together.\n\nJudge: What does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): The leather coming together, like when you put your hand down, it was poking together. I don’t know, I have pictures. I can show you, I can explain it better than I can explain it.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you come over here so you can point out for me what you mean.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Right here, right here.\n\nJudge: Okay, so show me what you mean.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Okay, this is the undamaged sofa in my house. Is that a different sofa than the one?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): That's the sofa, but this is when it first arrived, okay, in good condition.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): So now here’s the damage area.\n\nJudge: But what is it? What are you saying? This area.\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): And what, but what? I don’t see anything, I’m trying to figure out what you’re saying. You're saying that there’s extra fabric there?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Yes, it’s just in a lump, and the other here, it’s worse, like this.\n\nJudge: But didn’t it arrive that way?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): No, it did not.\n\nJudge: Because that’s sort of like in the stitching, isn’t it?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): I’m not sure. Let me see those.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead and go back. Thank you.\n\nJudge: When did you first hear that your customer was unhappy?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): She came back about 3 to 4 weeks later and said that I brought up a leather cushion to show what she was saying that was wrong with it.\n\nJudge: Come on up here with the leather cushion.\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): It’s not the same exact form that couch, but just to show what her complaint was.\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Just that when you sit on it, you know, she just, when you press on it, it just crinkles up. Anytime you sit on your rear end on leather, you're going to have creases on the edges.\n\nJudge: When you sit down on leather, is that what you told her?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Yes.\n\nJudge: You were unhappy about that, when you sat on it, it wrinkled?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Yes.\n\nJudge: And your response to this is?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): She’s saying it’s damaged, but it’s not damaged, because anytime you sit on leather, that’s what happens.\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): This is what she’s complaining about.\n\nJudge: So what do you suppose that is?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): That’s just the leather. The stitching around the leather is... is there something wrong with that stitching?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): It’s a brand new set.\n\nJudge: Not at all. Did any of you guys ever go over to her house to look at it?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): No, but I offered to send an upholsterer to go and look at it, and she said she didn’t want that. She wanted her money back.\n\nJudge: Did they offer to have somebody go look at it?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): No, no one ever contacted me.\n\nJudge: So when you buy a sofa, does, as you sit on it, does the leather naturally bunch up in the back or in the middle?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Never.\n\nJudge: Never?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): Only pleather would bunch up.\n\nJudge: Pleather would possibly bunch up. Anybody? Everybody agree? Would leather bunch up when you sit on it?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): I think so. It bunches up. It doesn’t bunch up.\n\nJudge: Who’s going to get the last word here?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): It doesn’t bunch up unless it’s exposed to too much moisture.\n\nJudge: Oh, that’s an interesting theory.\n\nJudge: So the moisture would probably be caused by the owner?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Yes, being negligent.\n\nJudge: Fair enough.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom, if that’s the stitching on that one place there, what would be the remedy?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): It’d be to return it and get another one.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that would probably be because that would be a manufacturer thing if it’s stitching. It has nothing to do with wear or anything else, but I want to send this to confirm that because he's the one who’s got to say that that’s what it is. You can’t do that from a picture.\n\nJudge: Does she have pictures to show you that day?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): No, but like... and this is the picture that bothers me the most. It appears that there might be something wrong with the stitching right there, that it’s bunching up. The way it was stitched, not when you sit on it. The leather crinkles because that’s natural, of course, but that the stitching might be off.\n\nJudge: Now, if it’s not a stitching problem, if the leather just, you know, you sit on it and then, like, you know, there’s a little bit of wrinkle here, a little bit, that’s not... that’s leather. That’s the stuffing in the thing. That’s how leather is.\n\nJudge: So the only thing that would give you a remedy in court is if the stitching was somehow off. I can’t really tell from this picture. I really wish that you had the couch in your pocket and I could look at it and feel it and whatever. But if in fact it was a stitching problem and that was something that was subpar, why did you inspect the merchandise and sign that it was A-OK?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): The merchandise was perfect when...\n\nJudge: Then it’s not the stitching, then it is what?\n\nPlaintiff (Janette Hicks): It was then fine. This picture is a little deceiving. It’s making it look like it’s a stitching one, but it’s actually just that the leather is bunching, just like you said.\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Can I just say something?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): She was never in that store, and she never called my house and she never said, \"I’ll send somebody out.\"\n\nJudge: No, she never said, \"I didn’t say house.\"\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Who’s we?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Yeah, the salesperson who sold her.\n\nJudge: That’s what he’s telling you. She’s... I want you to listen though, because it’s a customer service issue. She is... I believe her, because she’s shocked that you're saying that. That that guy never offered that to her, so you might want to talk to him.\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): I could offer it now if she’d like to send somebody over there to take a look.\n\nJudge: Just to take a look at it?\n\nDefendant (Lisa Monroe): Yes.\n\nJudge: Yeah, you guys can talk about that in the hallway over here.

{"id": "768", "dialogue": "Judge: Christina Selly You are suing an... you've asked to be referred to only by the name An?\nDefendant: Yes\nJudge: For work that you did for her as a nanny that according to you she didn't pay you for plus your time lost in having to sue her for that all right what's going on?\nPlaintiff: Okay so I started working for the defendant at the end of April. I found her through a website called care.com. I had previously found another job on there so this was my second job from that website. I'm 18. Um when I was first hired we had agreed that she'd pay me $8 an hour. After a few weeks I started to notice that the amount of hours I was working wasn't adding up with the money that she was giving me. The reason why I didn't say anything is I didn't know if she had a financial issue. Coming from a household with a single mom I know how hard things can be sometimes and I really like the job so I didn't say anything.\nJudge: Why would you not say anything if you're working the hours and she's not paying you?\nPlaintiff: I love, I love the job so much.\nJudge: Why wouldn't you say something and then say you know I didn't want to be fired?\nPlaintiff: Honestly I didn't want to want be fired for saying you underpaid me.\nJudge: But you don't think that you have... that's the problem being 18 you don't feel like you have the right to say wait a minute I think this is off in a nice polite fashion?\nPlaintiff: Yes\nJudge: All right go on.\nPlaintiff: Okay so on June 17th that was a Sunday was after school had been let out she asked me if I could work the following Monday the 18th. I said yes that's fine with me but I can't work Wednesday I have previous arrangements. So I worked that Monday the 18th from 8:00 to 3:00 and then she texted me around 6:00 at night asking me if I could pick her daughter up from camp at 4:00 on Wednesday. I told her no I already told you I couldn't work I'm sorry I can't and she just got kind of snotty with me and asked me wow why didn't you give me a 2 weeks notice. So I got pretty upset that she was being rude or snotty back to me because I felt like I had been understanding the whole time about the money and so I told her you know you had given me no set hours for the week and I confronted her about the money issue that's when she came back to me saying she had a nanny cam on me monitoring me the whole time and she also claimed that her daughter was unsupervised numerous times but she had never once confronted me about that so I feel as though if she told me that her daughter or if she felt that her daughter was unsafe she should have said something about it.\nJudge: Okay here's what I'm not getting then. So what you're saying is that um you're telling her you can't work Wednesday?\nPlaintiff: Yes\nJudge: And that's when you get fired?\nPlaintiff: Yes correct\nJudge: So I just feel... is this all through text or?\nPlaintiff: Yes I have the text messages.\nJudge: Yes what's going on?\nDefendant: Um basically I mean I agree with what she said I found her through care but um I brought a copy of the description I put on care.com stating that I'm looking for a sitter for a 5-year-old and that it needed to be someone who could be there on Mondays once in a while every Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday and that I needed someone that could play with my daughter and that was going to play it was specific in the ad that she responded to and that if you're not playing with her that you are not getting paid.   Defendant: And and so uh I went to work on that Monday from 9 to 1 and during the time I was at work my roommate who was in the home texted me to let me know that she fell asleep and that my daughter was being unattended so I was supposed to work till 3:00. I went home to get my daughter when I got there Christina was outside underneath one of the trees in the backyard and my daughter was playing off by herself.\nJudge: So playing off where?\nDefendant: She was in the backyard but she was just not being watched not being played with.\nJudge: Where's your your roommate is this your...\nDefendant: No she I have two roommates at the time he just started a job but it is in the police report he gave a statement and I brought a copy of the police report with me as well.\nJudge: Let me see it... Can I see the nanny cam?\nDefendant: I don't have a nanny cam it was him that I... he was watching...\nJudge: Except for that what you said was \"I have a nanny cam and I've been watching you and you all you do all day is sit and text.\" That's not what you said your roommate told you.\nDefendant: Your roommate says I'm sorry did I...\nJudge: Breathe and give you the impression I was done speaking? What you said roommate said was that she was outside in the backyard with her and nodded off and that your roommate then called you and then you came home but this is rather... it's sort of an interesting choice of words because it's \"I have a nanny cam I've been watching you all you do is sit all day and text\" and this doesn't happen. It's interesting that this is all 7:26 June 18th at 6:52 you're asking her to watch your kid correct even though your nanny cam has already shown you that she's you know so I don't get...\nDefendant: I found out on Monday was that she was sleeping and that I had not known previously the texting and stuff I did...\nJudge: I need you to prove that to... to prove what?\nDefendant: That she was sleeping.\nJudge: Well other than the written in the police report that he gave to the police that's the only proof I have.\nJudge: This is your roommate and your roommate couldn't come here today?\nDefendant: Correct.\nJudge: I really need to talk to the guy who claims that she was asleep. Were you asleep?\nPlaintiff: No your honor I may have...\nJudge: You may have what?\nPlaintiff: I may have laid on the couch and watched TV with her daughter that's the only time I was ever on the couch doing anything that she's accusing me of. The one time I brought her out those text messages about going ice cream the one time I bring her out and try to do something fun with her is when she got upset with me.\nJudge: Is it wrong to put a nanny cam on a nanny without telling the nanny what do you think?\nDefendant: I think he should be able to have a camera and observe what's going on.\nJudge: Secretly why not?\nDefendant: Well that's the question why not?\nJudge: What do you think should you be able to put a nanny cam on a nanny?\nDefendant: Yes cuz she's watching your children she should be doing her job properly.\nJudge: Fair enough is it okay to do it secretly though that's the question.\nDefendant: Well I guess since you're the one paying her I mean I guess it should make sense I mean you're the one...      Judge: Secretly why not? Going inside the courtroom you send her a text saying \"wow what happened at 2 weeks notice okay thanks\" and then you... you say \"you haven't even... you hadn't even given me set hours for this week so I had no clue my mom just told me about it over the weekend.\" Why is mom telling you about it?\nPlaintiff: No she was telling me that we had plans.\nJudge: Oh your own plans.\n[Reading text messages]\nPlaintiff's text: \"I thought you'd have her in daycare when you first hired me you asked me what I wanted to make an hour I agreed to eight and you've been paying me five which is under minimum wage you don't always pay me on time either I haven't left because I like your daughter but I feel used I have my own real bills and I'm barely making anything from you I could easily have a waitressing job but I like the babysitting\"\nDefendant's response text: \"I have never paid you $5 an hour I have paid you eight even when you sit on the couch the whole time and text I have a nanny cam and have been watching you all you do is sit all day then you took her out for ice cream for four hours she said she went to four stores\"\nJudge: The reason I fired her is because it was a last straw when I heard she was sleeping.\nJudge: You're firing her because she has the nerve to stand up to you at that moment not even that it says she didn't give me two weeks notice.\nPlaintiff's Mother: When I'm not understanding what the defendant is trying to say... she's saying that she pre-prepaid her when the police officer showed up at her house why did she agree that she still owed her money and she was going to give us another check or give my daughter another check?\nJudge: [Reading police report] \"She disputed Stell's claim for hours worked last week and Monday but said she will pay her $8 an hour for whatever time is agreed upon. I advised the easiest thing to do would be to pay Stelly for 25 hours by mail and have no more contact.\"\nJudge: I'm going to order you to pay the $200.

{"id": "1025", "dialogue": "Judge: Miss Katrina, you brought this case before the court. What’s going on?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Well, our son, Caleb James, he just turned eight, and he started school. And already, he’s started having school issues. In school, he’s been getting into fights with other kids, he’s been arguing with the teachers, he’s not been doing his homework, and this is completely new behavior. He was an A and a B student, and now his grades are also dropping, and I think it has to do with what Bubba here is doing at home.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: So he’s a truck driver, and during our marriage, there were a lot of issues with that. A lot of, you know, strange women, just a lot of alcohol use, and I think that that hasn’t stopped. And now I think that that’s affecting Caleb.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I don’t think so.\r\n\r\nJudge: Excuse me, sir.\r\n\r\nJudge: Once it is your turn, I will come to you. That’s the first thing. Second thing, those loud outbursts, they will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nJudge: Continue.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: So during the marriage, there were a lot of issues with infidelity, with drug use, with alcohol use, and he’s still doing the same job. He’s still driving the same routes. And so I think he’s still bringing these same people into Caleb’s life, into his home with our son.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, my gosh. Okay. Well, is there anything else you wanted me to know before I move over to him?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: Can I call you Bubba?\r\n\r\nJudge: You.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Sure.\r\n\r\nJudge: Bubba, is what she’s saying true? You know, you cheated on her, you’re using drugs, you’re drinking alcohol, you’re doing all of this while you’re transporting things in an 18-wheeler?\r\n\r\nDefendant: No, I actually work one week on, one week off. So we have shared custody. So the week that I work, she has custody of Caleb.\r\n\r\nJudge: So the week that I worked—\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nDefendant: You—\r\n\r\nDefendant: The week I have off, I have custody of Caleb.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Right?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Some of the things she’s saying—yes, I do drink sometimes, you know.\r\n\r\nJudge: Are you drinking while you’re driving that 18-wheeler?\r\n\r\nDefendant: I do not drink while I drive, no.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I drink occasionally when I’m home.\r\n\r\nDefendant: It’s not too, too bad, but—\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, where would she be getting that from?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Well, I have a lot of female clients that I do transport for. So she thinks that I’m, you know, getting these jobs because I’m sleeping around, which—she’s very promiscuous herself. So—\r\n\r\nUnknown Speaker: Oh.\r\n\r\nUnknown Speaker: You—\r\n\r\nUnknown Speaker: You—\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes. Caleb has told me that she has brought in a lot of men around him, and he doesn’t know who they are.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: So Caleb is just seeing a lot from the both of you, sounds like.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Maybe not.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: And Caleb, he’s eight.\r\n\r\nJudge: Who pays health insurance for Caleb?\r\n\r\nDefendant: I do.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right, how much do you pay?\r\n\r\nDefendant: 75 a month.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay?\r\n\r\nJudge: And Miss Katrina, you’re looking for him to pay child support?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I am.\r\n\r\nJudge: Based on what?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: So when COVID hit, I lost my job, and I just haven’t been able to find a comparable job to that.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: And I was doing engineering.\r\n\r\nJudge: And you can’t find anything comparable during COVID?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: In engineering?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: No.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: No.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: My degree was in chemical engineering.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: But all the jobs I’ve been finding have been mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. I haven’t found something that’s comparable to what I’ve been doing.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, I don’t know much about engineering, but how much more different is it?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I mean—\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I think it’s pretty different.\r\n\r\nJudge: You think.\r\n\r\nJudge: But how different is it?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I don’t know because I haven’t done mechanical engineering or electrical engineering, so I don’t have a basis to compare the two.\r\n\r\nJudge: What do you think about that?\r\n\r\nDefendant: I just think she’s lazy.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, you said it.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Because with her, she has a degree in engineering.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Chemical engineering.\r\n\r\nJudge: Wait a minute, stop right there. You have a degree.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge: In engineering.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yes. That’s how I got my job in chemical engineering.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right.\r\n\r\nJudge: So you can’t do a general engineering job with that degree?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: It’s not comparable to what I was doing.\r\n\r\nJudge: That wasn’t my question. Have you looked for jobs that will pay you for general engineering?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yes.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: You—\r\n\r\nJudge: All right, how many interviews have you gone on?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Three or four in the last six months.\r\n\r\nJudge: Three or four in the last six months, and they all said no to hiring you?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: You—\r\n\r\nJudge: You—\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: The—\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge: That’s interesting. I saw you signal over here. You said zero?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Mm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge: How do you know, sir, that she hasn’t gone on any of these job interviews?\r\n\r\nDefendant: I have a friend.\r\n\r\nDefendant: That she knows.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mmm.\r\n\r\nDefendant: And he’s told me.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, that’s right.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Because he’s been sleeping with her.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, OK, well, that’s none of my business, has nothing to do with me. Miss Katrina, I haven’t heard a single reason why I should place this man on child support. He testified and said that he works one week on, one week off.\r\n\r\nJudge: He has Caleb during his week off.\r\n\r\nJudge: He pays health insurance. You have Caleb—I’m assuming—well, not an assumption, what he said, that...\r\n\r\nJudge: When he’s on, you have Caleb.\r\n\r\nJudge: I’m assuming all of that’s the truth, right?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yeah, yeah, we do have that one week on, one week off, but with these behaviors that Caleb’s having, he needs treatment, he needs help, he needs counseling, he needs something to help.\r\n\r\nJudge: And I don’t disagree with you there. I do believe that if he is having behavioral issues and everything like that, maybe seek some type of therapy, play therapy, maybe.\r\n\r\nJudge: Individual counseling, maybe you all could do family counseling, but that is not a legitimate reason to place this man on child support. So I’m going to deny your request today to place him on child support. And in addition to denying that request, that 75 that he’s paying, I’m going to have you split it. Since you share custody, you need to share costs too. So 37.50 is what you will be reimbursing him for health insurance every month.\r\n\r\nJudge: Is there anything further?\r\n\r\nJudge: Is there anything further, sir?\r\n\r\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, well, there’s nothing further. You all are dismissed.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Thank you, ma’am.\r\n\r\nJudge: You’re welcome.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal"}
{"id": "11", "dialogue": "Judge: Maria scarcella, yes you are suing John. You've asked to be referred to only by your first name and not to mention your company name. You're suing John's company for $3,500, the estimate that you have to redo a sidewalk that you say he did in a faulty fashion. Tell me what happened.\nPlaintiff: Yes, um basically my brother had hired John to do pavers, a sidewalk, um other brick work around the house but my brother unexpectedly passed away in March of 2008.\nJudge: I'm sorry to hear that.\nPlaintiff: Thank you. Um so I put the job on hold till about 8-9 months later when I was ready to revisit the job. Um in the interim my mom and I moved into his house and um I wanted to execute his, my brother's wishes so I contacted John and um we started the work December of '08.\nJudge: And what was the work?\nPlaintiff: We had to do the whole entire driveway. We had to do some work in the back, fix a waterproof, do some stuff around the house.\nJudge: No, I, I, if I want to know what the work is, things like \"stuff around the house\" \"some work in the back\" is not an answer. I want to know because it was kind of, it was a very good contract for you right? How much was this?\nPlaintiff: Uh close to 42,000.\nJudge: 42,000. So I'm trying to understand what the work was exactly. What was the work?\nPlaintiff: We had to do a whole new sidewalk curb, uh how many feet of sidewalk about uh 40 ft. 40 by 4. Then we had to build a ramp with a new set of stairs. We had a uh fix old staircase, repoint it. We also had to repoint the whole front of the house, waterproof it. We also did some Cobblestone work which is a natural uh Stone pretty much all around.\nJudge: Picture of it? Um I have a picture of the um...\nPlaintiff: No, of the sidewalks in question.\nJudge: I'm just curious if a picture of the other one.\nPlaintiff: Yeah no. I have some most of the sidewalk but mainly from you know I have a piece of the driver.\nJudge: All right so the work is completed back in sometime in '08-'09 and um when is the first inkling that you have that there's something wrong and that you want him to readdress it?\nPlaintiff: Um that was the year we had really bad snowstorms. It was like snowstorm after snowstorm so spring of '09 when everything melted I noticed the sidewalk was chipping and everything else was fine and I'm content with the other work. The pavers are beautiful, the ramp... I actually added that work for the ramp because my mom had Parkinson's disease and she couldn't do, she needed a ramp so I even added more work to the original work. Um so the sidewalk just started chipping and but the ramp no and he specifically told me do not throw rock salt which I did not. Um I threw down the calcium chloride, the ones he said that was safe for the cements and everything so um and it just kept chipping and chipping.\nJudge: Is this what we're talking about?\nPlaintiff: Correct.\nJudge: God that's so weird.\nDefendant: The chipping, I have uh the chipping here and that's what it what causes this - that's from when it's very icy snow, the salt come, the trucks come around they spread the salt so that hits, that hits the sidewalk and once the Salt Rock lays there after a while salt will lead to anything.\nJudge: So you're talking about the city trucks?\nDefendant: Correct.\nJudge: What's it cost to put in a new sidewalk for those 40 ft?\nDefendant: Between $5 to $1,800 depending what uh you know who's doing it.\nJudge: But you've got an estimate for 3500?\nPlaintiff: Because I'm using another company.\nJudge: I know you're using another company obviously, yeah but um...\nPlaintiff: And he actually said when I told him I wasn't happy with it he said okay I'll do it for you at cost, 1600. At Cost 1600 and at first I agreed. I don't know why I shouldn't have and then I thought about it and I was like sometimes you're just tired that's why I guess you know. I just wanted, I just just wanted it over and done and...\nJudge: Right exactly.\nPlaintiff: Exactly and I didn't want it to have to come to this um and then I'm like wait a second you know and then I go back to the you know original invoice is a $42,000 job and like I said I'm happy with the pavers I'm happy with the ramp. The ramp has no chips. If it was Rock so the sidewalk should last a lot longer than...\nJudge: But what about what he's saying which is hey it's not my fault it's nothing defective in the sidewalk it's the you know the salt that the city's pouring?\nPlaintiff: Then then why did he agree to do the work in December? I even said to him is it okay to do the work in December?\nDefendant: Yeah don't worry about the concrete.\nJudge: Well no does that have... okay wait a minute let's find out what you're saying. What is your testimony that even whether you do the work in December or do the work ever that that salt is going to eat through the cement or only...\nDefendant: No doesn't matter.\nJudge: So in other words the next Christmas it was going to be the same problem?\nDefendant: Also you're...\nJudge: But why doesn't everybody's sidewalk look like that?\nDefendant: Exactly.\nJudge: Shouldn't everybody's sidewalk then look like this?\nPlaintiff: Also though with a ramp it was also concrete and there was nothing wrong with...\nJudge: Can you answer what I just asked?\nDefendant: What was that?\nJudge: Why doesn't everybody's sidewalk in Staten Island look like this?\nDefendant: Most of them they do you most of the sidewalk Staten Island look like...\nPlaintiff: No they don't! I looked at my neighbors I even walked around I saw beautiful concrete work.\nDefendant: After we had major snow storms salt will lead to anything.\nExpert Witness: On concrete and surfaces so that cement is chipping after 6 months is it a bad job?\nExpert Witness: Yeah absolutely it's a bad job.\nJudge: Need to redo it?\nExpert Witness: Bad snowstorm that so that winter I understand but they need to redo it.\nJudge: Why?\nExpert Witness: Because of 6 months is that the problem here I mean...\nJudge: No they just a bad job why do you why is it... is it automatically a bad job if it starts chipping after 6 months?\nExpert Witness: Yes it's too short of time.\nJudge: Yeah everybody agree everybody agree we're cool?\nDefendant: Depends what was told before you get the job if you said it wasn't going to go...\nExpert Witness: Yeah I'm going to do a really crappy job for you sir I don't think so.\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom I uh did a little research into what causes this kind of concrete pitting. Your pictures are actually much worse than hers. Um and um there's let's say maybe 10 reasons nine of which have to do with the contractor. The only one that the contractor can say hey it ain't me is the salt issue. She is very clear that she never put the kind you said don't put...\nDefendant: I am sure you tell your customers I I do yes.\nJudge: Yeah so and I know you do because she says he immediately told me and I would never use that so you say well maybe it's the city the city doesn't deice your sidewalks the city deices the street but maybe some of it spills on there well if that's the case I want to see how all of Staten Island has this or a lot of Staten Island has this and a lot you know I think that it's fair to say that this is not how Staten Island looks. Staten Island may have its problems now over Hurricane Sandy but it doesn't have its problems over concrete and the concrete issue. The concrete issue is usually due this kind of pitting the usual culprits are the poor concrete the excessive accelerator used when you're trying to do it in the winter and avoid bad weather that is on the horizon anyway. I uh when you tell me oh it cost $1,500 to do that that's interesting because you told her that your cost, your cost um and Judge the labor was $1,500 so it can't possibly cost her $1,500 to get this done at least not here in New York. How many estimates did you get?\nDefendant: I got um...\nJudge: Not you I'm sorry.\nPlaintiff: I just have one.\nJudge: Did you get estimates?\nDefendant: I did I had people go by to get a give a rough estimate of this what the sidewalk cost is.\nJudge: Yes oh can I see your estimates too?\nDefendant: Sure.\nJudge: Wait whose estimates are these?\nDefendant: Frank's masonry.\nJudge: That's mine oh and one masonry and Tony masonry correct those are all yours. What are your estimates let me see your estimates.\nPlaintiff: I just have Mesak Kappa.\nJudge: Okay let me see that.\nPlaintiff: Who was highly recommended and a friend of mine uses him.\nJudge: Right I understand that but I have to figure out what the um fair market value of this job is as opposed to just um the guy you want to go with if he's twice as expensive. I do however have a concern that if you tell her that you'll do it at Cost and she has to pay 1,600 that then you just got your buddies in the business to say it's $1400.\nDefendant: The way it goes your honors in Staten Island goes by the square foot a normal square foot goes from uh $5 to $7 $8.\nJudge: You I know but here's where my problem lies I don't, I don't know if I trust you if you tell a customer that your cost is 1500 and then you're showing me you know oh look 1400 is what it costs why are you telling a customer that your cost is 1600 because that means you're not making profit so if if it's true that your cost is 15 or 1600 how much what did he said he do?\nPlaintiff: I'll do it at my cost.\nJudge: He do it at my cost 1,600 then that means that you're forgoing profit that means that the real cost is supposed to be you know double or something so why is it that her quote is so bad and why is it that your quotes are lower than what you claim your cost was?\nDefendant: Now I trust you right when I do when I go to get the sidewalk permits I have to pay other people to get the permits that you know that you know pay this pay that that adds up.\nJudge: Yeah how come it doesn't add up for the other guys?\nDefendant: I have no idea how the other guy works.\nJudge: Yeah I do what happens is you have friends in the business and you ask them to give you lowball and then what I watch for on that side is one estimate instead of three and the one estimate is highball. I I you guys think you're my first rodeo you're not my first rodeo I do this all the time. All right guys to be honest stop we're done we're done we're done.

It’s the case of \"You Burn Me Up.\" Thank you.\n\nJudge: Tatiana Kernisant, you are suing RVG Auto Center, represented here by Paul Kazy. You’re the owner?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. You’re suing for $4,850, the amount that you paid him for car repairs and the price of the car because, according to you, after the repairs and thanks to his negligence, the car caught on fire.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Good Lord. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, on January 30th, I brought my car in to get repairs.\n\nJudge: Who did you buy the car from?\n\nPlaintiff: I bought the car from my fiancé, Jeffrey Jean-Baptiste.\n\nJudge: You got a ring, you got a date?\n\nPlaintiff: Not a date.\n\nJudge: Well, you got a ring?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nPlaintiff: I bought the car for $33,000.\n\nJudge: You bought it in January, and you decided to put $2,000 worth of work into it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. It’s a 12-year-old car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What kind of car?\n\nPlaintiff: An Audi A6, 2000 model.\n\nJudge: All right. So what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, when I took it in, the car had an overheating problem. That’s what I wanted to get fixed. The Defendant called me a day later and told me that he gave me a list of things that needed to be fixed. He told me the overheating problem was being caused by the water pump, timing belt, gasket, and thermostat. Those things would have to be fixed. He said the car would need a full tune-up. He also told me my back rotors and back brakes weren’t good, so he recommended I get those fixed as well.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you asked him how much everything would come up to?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He broke it down in parts and labor, and he told me everything would come up to $1,850.\n\nJudge: And you authorized the work?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you picked up the car?\n\nPlaintiff: When I picked up the car, it was February 6th, the same day I got the car registered.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I had the car from February 6th to February 14th. On February 14th, I parked the car in the garage. On February 15th, I left for Florida to visit my sister for two weeks. I came back on February 27th.\n\nJudge: I assume you’re pointing that out to me not because I need to know your whereabouts, but to point out that the car wasn’t driven?\n\nPlaintiff: It wasn’t driven.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So on Monday, February 27th, I took the car from the garage. My brother called me and asked if I could bring him to Queens because he was going to bring his car for repairs, and he wanted me to drive him back home to Brooklyn. I said okay, no problem. I went to the garage, picked up the car, and followed my brother. When we got to Jamaica Avenue, I started to smell smoke.\n\nJudge: Were you in the car with your brother or following him?\n\nPlaintiff: I was following him, in the car by myself. I started to smell smoke coming from somewhere underneath the hood. Then the smoke got into the vents, and I started to feel dizzy.\n\nJudge: How much did you keep driving when there was smoke?\n\nPlaintiff: It was just a block. I made a quick turn and tried to pull over to the curb as fast as possible. I turned off the car, grabbed my bag and phone, and ran out. Three guys standing in front of a barber shop saw me and said, \"Miss, your car is smoking!\" I asked them for help. They popped the hood—\n\nJudge: Oh my gosh, what were they thinking?\n\nPlaintiff: They went into the barber shop and got a fire extinguisher. They tried to put out the fire near the engine.\n\nJudge: Did you actually see flames or just smoke?\n\nPlaintiff: It was flames and smoke.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I called 911. The fire department came, but by then, the fire had spread under the car. By the time they arrived, the car was destroyed.\n\nJudge: Do you have a fire report?\n\nPlaintiff: They didn’t give me one.\n\nJudge: Do you have video?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\n[Plaintiff shows video.]\n\nJudge: Good Lord.\n\nPlaintiff: I ran as far as possible because I knew I wouldn’t be able to explain it later.\n\nJudge: So why do you believe it’s his fault?\n\nPlaintiff: Because they were the last people to work on my car. The fire marshal asked if I had work done recently. I said yes, two to three weeks ago. He said it was an electrical fire.\n\nJudge: But you don’t have proof of that?\n\nPlaintiff: The fire department said the fire started where the repairs were made.\n\nJudge: That’s not enough. Without expert testimony or a fire report, I can’t determine fault. My verdict is for the Defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know I needed a fire report.\n\nJudge: Unfortunately, I need more evidence to rule in your favor.

{"id": "766", "dialogue": "\"Judge:\nThis is the plaintiff Andrew Wilds. He says he rented the second floor of his two-family house to the defendant, and when he moved his wife and son in, there was suddenly a mouse problem. He thinks he brought the mice from Jamaica where he lived prior to moving in. The man caused all sorts of crazy trouble. Bottom line, he stopped paying the rent and he’s here suing for the $1,675 he’s owed.\nThis is the defendant, Silbert Rose. He says he lived in that apartment for 44 years without any problems. Then all of a sudden, the plaintiff turned evil. It was like a switch went off in his head and he was forced to leave. He owes him money for all the trouble he caused. He’s accused of running out on rent. No parties, please. Alright, your welcome back to the People's Court, next case in the dock.\nJudge:\nThe plaintiff says he rented the second floor of his home to the defendant and when the defendant brought his wife from Jamaica, there was suddenly a mice problem. But the defendant says the plaintiff is pure evil. It's the case of I hate those Mice to Pieces.\nAndrew W, you are suing your former tenant Silbert Rose for $1,675 that you say you are owed in rent and late fees from when he departed. Tell me what’s going on.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nOkay, it came to a point where he paid his rent for March late.\nJudge:\nHow long had he been living there?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nHe had been living there over 40 years. He was a tenant of my aunt. My mother passed away, I inherited the house. So I didn’t charge him a security deposit when I took over the house.\nJudge:\nDid he pay a security deposit when your aunt was renting to him?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYes.\nJudge:\nHow much in security deposit did he pay your aunt?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\n$350 back in 1972.\nJudge:\nAnd you know that because he say so?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYes.\nJudge:\nWhat, do you have any evidence that he paid a security deposit?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nNo. What I had informed him was that if he was able to produce the receipt, I had no problem with giving him back his security deposit.\nJudge:\nWas he able to?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nNo.\nJudge:\nWhen did you start having problems?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nThe problem actually started when he moved his family in from Jamaica.\nJudge:\nOkay.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nOkay, not Queens, but the island.\nJudge:\nOh, you say that like it’s a bad thing?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nRight.\nJudge:Okay. Why, you’re saying... my child’s godmother is from Jamaica, starting to take a little offense, but go ahead.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):Okay, the first problem was that he had a problem with the wife. They stated that he had committed domestic violence against her and had him put out on the street. The man was crying. He was put out. She had an order of protection against him, and then eventually, she led him back into the house. As time went on, other issues started to arise. The noise. 5:00 in the morning, she’s using a carpet sweeper. They walked like there was no floor in the house. This bouncing... I mean stomping, it was just out of control. I had to tell her in the text one day that this is America now. I don’t know what you all did in Jamaica, but in America, Black people usually wake up on a Saturday and Sunday a little bit later in the day.\nJudge: Okay. The sun...\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):We started receiving mail at my residence with other people’s names on it.\nJudge: Is it a communal mailbox?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):Yes.\nJudge:Didn’t you just look at it, think it was an error, and send it back to the post office?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):So, one of the letters had a gentleman’s name, Mr. Lily. I spoke to Mr. Rose and asked him if he had any relatives named Charles Lily, and he said no. Later on, another envelope came in for Charles Lily from UPS. So we wrote on it, return to sender. UPS turned around and returned the same envelope back to us.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):So previously, maybe the day or so before, the son, Mr. Jackson, came to my door and asked me if I received any mail, which I didn’t. The person that received the mail was my daughter and wife. My wife got into an argument with Mr. Jackson over this envelope that came from you. Come on up.\nJudge: Wife?\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna):Good morning.\nJudge:Good morning. So tell me about the argument.\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna):So I go out there, and I saw that it says Charles Lily. I told him at the time, no, there is no Charles Lily that lives here, and you should not be giving this mail to him. I asked him what was his name, and he refused to give up his name.\nJudge: Did the UPS guy end up giving him the mail?\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna): Yes. He ended up... yes, he ended up giving the mail.\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna):I got into it with his stepson saying, \"\"I am Charles Lily. It’s from my uncle.\"\" He kept on saying, \"\"From my... said, so your uncle is named Charles.\"\"\nJudge: I just want you to know that whatever mail comes to this house and it’s not with your name, your mother’s name, or Mr. Rose, it will be going back where it belongs, at the post office.\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna): Right.\nJudge: Did you ever get to the bottom of all this or just alert the authorities?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds): We went to the local post office, we put in a claim, they did it also because her federal income tax was missing. We put in a claim for that, and you ended up seeing the check was forged by someone.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds): Yes.\nJudge: Well, whose account did it go into, or did it just get cashed?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):It got cashed, yeah.\nJudge:That’s the end of that, unless it got cashed at a check-cashing place. It must have been something like that. There’d be pictures. Doesn’t it say where it got cashed?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYeah, they sent me the MICR form paperwork for me to do so. So I had to prove my signatures, and this person just printed my name, and they started misspelling.\nJudge:\nCome closer to the microphone, Mom. Step back a second. Don’t push it.\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna):\nRight, but okay, so, but were they able to see what entity cashed the check?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nThey never stated such a thing, but they showed me a picture, a photocopy of what the signature looked like.\nJudge:\nI’m just curious, what... who’s cashing these checks without like a, you know, without a... a... cameras and that kind of thing.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nAlright, but... but you ended up getting your money back from the IRS.\nPlaintiff’s Wife (Anna):\nI think so.\nJudge:\nMr. Rose, how are you? 44 years living in a place is a long time. I’d hate to have some stepson come in and ruin it like that. What happened? What was your stepson doing, getting all kinds of mail that you didn’t... did you ever confront him and say, \"\"I’ve been living here 44 years; you have ruined everything for me\"\"?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI did.\nJudge:\nAnd what did he say?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nLike he didn’t know about it.\nJudge:\nOh, he didn’t know about it, but you don’t believe he didn’t know about it.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nWell, it’s true. I don’t believe him.\nJudge:\nI didn’t believe him either.\nJudge:\nAre you still with the mom?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, ma’am.\nJudge:\nYou are? And did she falsely accuse you of domestic violence?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, she did.\nJudge:\nWhy are you with that lady? What magic does she have?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI don’t know.\nJudge:\nYou are no longer living there, correct?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nRight.\nJudge:\nAlright. So he’s suing you because he says that you didn’t pay rent for April.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, I did not, because I thought I was living out my security. That’s the reason why I didn’t pay that much.\nJudge:\nWell, let’s talk about that. Your security... do you have any proof of having paid security or you don’t have that after 44 years?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, ma’am. I think I have the first check... see?\nJudge:\nOh, great. Can I see it?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes.\nJudge:\n1972, am I right?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYeah, that’s the one.\nJudge: Do you have a check that goes with this?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose): No, I just paid in cash and you gave me a receipt for it.\nJudge: Take a look at that and tell me what you say. Does that look like your aunt’s writing and all that? I mean, I don’t know if you’d be familiar with it.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nDoes.\nJudge: Alright. And does it say security deposit on that receipt?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nBoy, I was ready to... I just keep getting surprised around here. It doesn’t say that.\nJudge:\nOkay. So what was the amount of your security deposit?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\n$190, not 350.\nJudge:\nNo? Okay.\nJudge:\nSo your security deposit was $190 in 1972. Got it. So if your rent is $1,000 in April, how is it you were calculating that the 190, 44 years earlier, was sufficient to pay rent in April?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nNo, but the rent keeps going up, you know?\nJudge:\nYeah, I know. That’s my point, right? Rent keeps going up, so you can’t pay 1972 rents.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nAre you happy where you’re living now?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nNo.\nJudge:\nDo you wish you were still living there?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYeah, sure. I didn’t have a problem. I didn’t have a problem with him.\nJudge:\nNo, I know. He didn’t have a problem with you either. It’s the people you surround yourself with.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nHe had a problem.\nJudge:\nSo can landlords and tenants get along indefinitely? Or is there inevitably a falling out?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nI really would... no, I rent from my grandma and she’s been the greatest landlord ever, so...\nJudge:\nOkay, anybody not rent from their grandma here?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nWhat do you say?\nJudge:\nI’m with her.\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI live with my mom.\nJudge:\nGoing inside the courtroom, at some point then, because of the issues, you tell him he’s got to go, right?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYes, ma’am.\nJudge:\nYou tell him he can stay, but you raise the rent.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nWe told him that he could stay, but his family had to go.\nJudge:\nHad to go?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYes.\nJudge:\nRight. Alright. You tell them that when?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nIn December.\nJudge:\nYes? Late?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nI’m sorry, October.\nJudge:\nOkay. Come December, though, which was supposed to be the last month, you asked him for more time.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nCorrect.\nJudge:\nAnd you ended up staying all the way until April?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, I did.\nJudge:\nAnd then you were paying between January, February, March, and April, you’re supposed to be paying what, $1,000 a month? And what had rent been in December?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nIn December, it was $900.\nJudge:\nSo he pays January, he pays February. March is the first month you have a problem. What happened?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nYes, he paid late, nine days late.\nJudge:\nAnd what happened with April?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nHe did not pay at all.\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you pay, Mr. Rose?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI didn’t think I had to pay because I thought my security deposit would cover.\nJudge:\nDid you tell him that?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, I told him that.\nJudge:\nOkay. Did you have to leave, or were you asked to leave?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI was asked to leave.\nJudge:\nSo did you leave?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, ma’am.\nJudge:\nWhen?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nIn the middle of March.\nJudge:\nSo you left in the middle of March. So, you’re still saying that you owe him $1,675 because you didn’t pay April rent and you’re refusing to pay because you say you’re using your security deposit?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, ma’am. But it’s not the full $1,675. I believe the rent should be $900, because in December that’s the rent I paid.\nJudge:\nAlright. So your argument is you owe him $900 for April. Why didn’t you pay him for the month of March?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nBecause I thought my security would cover it, as I’ve been saying.\nJudge:\nRight. And did you talk to him about this?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nYes, I did.\nJudge:\nSo you’ve been living in this apartment for 44 years, but you’re telling me you didn’t know how security deposits work?\nDefendant (Silbert Rose):\nI didn’t think it would be an issue, honestly.\nJudge:\nWell, that’s the issue. Landlords are entitled to charge rent, and the security deposit isn’t to be used as a substitute for rent. So the deposit is supposed to be used for any damage or if you leave without fulfilling the terms of the lease.\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nCorrect. I let him stay past December, and I even gave him more time. I was flexible with him.\nJudge:\nOkay. So, just to be clear, we’re talking about $900 for April rent and $775 in late fees for March, correct?\nPlaintiff (Andrew Wilds):\nCorrect.\nJudge:\nAlright, I’m going to make a decision now.\nJudge:\nIn this case, I find that the defendant did not pay the rent for April, and while I understand there were issues surrounding the security deposit, the landlord had the right to charge rent separately. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to receive the full $1,675 in rent and late fees.\nJudge:\nThe defendant’s argument that the security deposit should cover rent is not valid, as the security deposit is not meant to replace rent payments. Therefore, I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of $1,675.\nJudge:\nThis case is decided.\nBailiff:\nAll rise.\"", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, persuasion.

So get this the plaintiff has lived in her apartment for 40 years and then all of a sudden some tenants move into the building they make her life a living Nightmare and says the defendant landlord won't do anything about it but the landlord says that this woman is acting like she owns the place. It's the case of squatter he hardly knew her. Lisa Klein yes you are suing George stios for $5,000 in damages because according to you he rented to tenants who stomped on the ground to the point where your medicine cabinet fell down and many other damages according to you yes correct. All right you're going to have to explain to me what you're what you're trying to say here go ahead.\nPlaintiff: Mr stle here moved in in 2008 the same day when my husband died he passed away. Mr moved in however in April of 2009 I started having a lot of problems because I I was getting leaks a lot of leaks from him and he I told him and he refused to do anything.\nJudge: Howsoever well did you you live in a condo right?\nPlaintiff: Correct.\nJudge: Did you tell the condo board?\nPlaintiff: Yes I did I went and I told them because uh you know after five complaints so finally the condo came in h the condo repair people came in and they fixed it. So anyway uh back in 2011 he rented the apartment and he rented to a family with a kid but constantly the kids kept jumping and jumping and jumping.\nJudge: How old was the kid?\nPlaintiff: Uh 7even or eight years years old.\nJudge: More than one child?\nPlaintiff: One and she They al how many pounds 45 lbs. Okay okay started with my lamp in the kitchen the light went off because someone's walking or jumping above you the light part of the lamp part of the lamp in the ceiling in the kitchen came down.\nJudge: Do you have evidence that a lamp came down?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: What did you do when the lamp came down?\nPlaintiff: I got you came down Falls completely down well part of it fell down.\nJudge: What part of it fell down?\nPlaintiff: Oh part of the uh frame the wood mold and then the light the wood two of the lights right two of the lights went off. Then um my smoke detector test C came in one day I got fed up already I call him again uh Mr s refused to do anything.\nJudge: What did he say to you?\nPlaintiff: I say George do me a favor why don't you put at least some type of rug you know so I wouldn't have so much.\nJudge: Did they not have rugs?\nPlaintiff: I told them and they put rugs they did put rugs yep the area rugs not rug I don't know.\nJudge: So your bottom line is that he rented to people who had a child who weighs 45 lbs who stomped around so much that your kitchen light broke broke your ceiling fan came down yep and let me see your ceiling fan coming down. Do you call anybody from the condo board while any of this is going on?\nPlaintiff: Oh yes I made four complaints here they are.\nJudge: Let me see the complaints. Okay this is a picture of your ceiling fan but it's not down it's up and attached. What's what am I supposed to see in this picture?\nPlaintiff: In this pictur that uh the the thing that he goes around the light came down.\nJudge: You mean the the glow the glass?\nPlaintiff: I'm sorry I don't understand what you're saying do you mean the glass globe? Yeah.\nJudge: Okay what is this supposed to be a picture of?\nPlaintiff: That is the bathroom.\nJudge: What about the bathroom what are you saying?\nPlaintiff: I was in the bed and I heard like a big Bo and the K was jumping and I was get I was aggravated so all of a sudden the cabinet right here the door is made out of hit the cabinet broke.\nJudge: Are you talking about the mirror on the cabinet the cabinet fell okay and it did what to the toilet?\nPlaintiff: It did that what to the toilet destroy it.\nJudge: Show me where it's destroyed. She's saying that the seat connects to there and this piece is missing from there. What do you mean it's missing? I mean if a mirror fell down then it knocked it out then where's the piece?\nDefendant: I don't know what happened the only thing I know what's going on mr's going uh she she had called me and complained about the noise so I called my tenants I said you know what's going on she's telling me that your child is running around doing too much making too much noise so they said he's not really running around he's you know goes to bed at certain time he comes home from school we eat with him he might occasionally skip this that you know like a normal kid so I said can you just do me a favor I don't want to have any headaches please just you know keep it to you know as much of a minimum as you can. Then she then Lisa called me again and said my mirror broke then I went to her apartment to see the damage she's like you have to you know I want you to see the damage so I walked in I saw a broken mirror and a toilet seat cover.\nJudge: Did she ever show you anything about a ceiling fan or a lamp in the kitchen or?\nDefendant: No well we walked into the bathroom and we just looked at that and I saw the mirror had three mirrors and I said just the middle piece fell out I was like you know I looked at that and I'm like is it possible wasn't like you know installed properly maybe the middle piece was a little weaker how could just one out of three that are all installed the same exact way fall out said whatever you know so then she tells me you hear you hear them and did you and then I we both got really quiet and we heard a little pitter patter of a child you know maybe skipping or something and I was like at that point I said to myself okay this is really unreasonable and I don't think she has a valid claim here and that's when I said I'm sorry but you know actually I'm sorry I told her at that point I said listen just to make this go away I don't want any headaches how about we split the cost of this mirror piece and the toilet seat cover which can't be that much I was like I'll put in half the money just to make this go away I don't want any headaches and she's like I am not paying for this I said okay at that point I was like she's not going to be reasonable with me she's unreasonable and there's nothing I can do.\nJudge: So is the landlord responsible for really awful tenants in the building? I think you have a right to a habitable living space. Okay fair enough is the land responsible of tenants are just noisy and awful if you bring it to the landlord's attention and they do nothing then yes.\nDefendant: You buy that?\nJudge: Yes I do to an incent landlord is responsible fair enough going inside the courtroom. Well let's talk about reasonable she's suing you for $2,362 59 for a licensed contractor to install a medicine cabinet a toilet seat and a ceiling fan because all that light has to be removed and put back do you understand how unreasonable you sound and then an additional $2,227 N4 cents for pain and suffering.\nPlaintiff: Yes had you seen from the beginning your honor how irresponsible he he was when I reported the leaks.\nJudge: But you're not for the leaks the leaks got resolved the leaks are 5 years ago. How long have you lived there miss Klein?\nPlaintiff: I lived there for 40 years.\nJudge: Okay Miss Klein I understand that you feel that your home is your castle and it is and I understand that but when you choose to do condo or apartment living one of the things that you agree to do is live in harmony with other people because you don't have your single family home and um that is within reasonable limits if somebody is excessively noisy I have a right to be free from somebody who's excessively noisy having said that different people have different tolerance levels I am an extremely Noy sensitive person I will hear a dripping faucet in another house I am very sensitive so I understand your pain but that doesn't make you and I reasonable okay the child has a right to walk in his apartment he can't stomp but if it's a 45 pound child how can it possibly be doing these things I I don't you know how is it that somebody walking upstairs can cause the Sky to fall down you know everything about everything's F raining appliances cuz a kid is skipping upstairs I mean it just doesn't make sense. These do you have an affidavit from the family do they write anything for you for court?\nDefendant: They did.\nJudge: Let me see let me see. That I work from 9 to 6 every day my wife's a stay-at home mom and works as a freelance makeup artist 10 hours a week my son is eight and weighs 45 lb we pride ourselves in supervising our son since we are well aware A Ware that we live above another person we make sure he does not run and play excessively and he doesn't disturb anyone and our daily routine includes removing our shoes before entering the apartment we are upstanding citizens of New York a hardworking family we pride ourselves on being respectful of our neighbors in our community we did everything in our power to live upstairs from Mrs Klein however we feel extremely uncomfortable with her non- neighborly ways.\nDefendant: I guess she would say something to them too and we uh subsequently moved to another residence and asked to be let out of our lease over this which I allowed them to because I didn't.\nJudge: How long before their lease their lease had a couple more months on it?\nDefendant: So yeah.\nPlaintiff: You honor I have the neighbor who live upstairs she would like to upstairs from whom from me I thought they for 35 years before he came into the picture and I brought.\nJudge: Thank you very much I don't need to hear from her. Miss Klein the question the only question I have in front of me is has have you adequately proven that a child that weighs 45 lbs has somehow caused the ceiling to fall down it is not whether you are angry with the person who owns a unit above you because of some leaks that happened that you don't feel he tended to quickly enough it is not that your rights are being disrespected because it's not as quiet as it was when she lived there for 35 years uh it that's just not what it's about you've come to me with $5,000 worth of Damages that you want him to pay you because he rented to noisy neighbors and that's not going to happen my verdict is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal,exaggeration"}
{"id": "966", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to the People’s Court. Next case in the docket: the plaintiff sold a car to the defendant, but the check bounced all over town. The defendant says the car clunked out the day after he bought it. It’s the case of “I got junk in the trunk and the engine.”\n\nJudge: Okay, Carlos Higera, you are suing Eddie Rossi for $1,100, the balance owed to you, you say, on a car that you sold to him, and he bounced a check. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: On February 2, my employee sold the car, a ‘97 Nissan Quest, for $1,800. He left a deposit of $300 that day.\n\nJudge: Okay. Was he buying the car from you, or do you own a dealership?\n\nPlaintiff: I own the dealership, but the car was not from the dealership. The car was my personal car.\n\nJudge: Personal car. Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: Then the gentleman said he liked the car to my salesman. He took the deposit for $300 that day. The next day, he came to pick it up, and he owed $1,500. I asked, “Where’s the balance?” He said, “Oh no, the bank was closed. I’ll give you a check for $1,100, but tomorrow morning, I’ll pay you and bring a coffee for you and your employee.” Tomorrow morning, he gets the car.\n\nJudge: Tomorrow morning, and you still waited three weeks?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him the car.\n\nJudge: You gave him the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you give him the title?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, because of how he was talking. He convinced me.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Rewind. I want to see if I got this right. You are a used car salesman?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: For how long?\n\nPlaintiff: 22 years.\n\nJudge: And you sold a car to a guy, gave him the title and everything else because he talked a good game, and now you’re out $1,100?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You got nailed on a used car transaction?\n\nPlaintiff: He gave me the check for $1,100.\n\nJudge: And what happened with that check?\n\nPlaintiff: It bounced.\n\nJudge: Right, so it’s no good. You needed money, not a bad check, right? What’s going on?\n\nDefendant: Just hearing the plaintiff talk about the check… When I left the place, he gave me all the paperwork.\n\nJudge: Did you give him an $1,100 check?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: You were surprised that he gave you the title and everything, weren’t you?\n\nDefendant: Well, I was a little surprised. And when I was leaving, he gave me all the papers for the car. I even said, “Don’t you want all your money before you give me the papers?”\n\nJudge: Exactly.\n\nDefendant: I told him, “I think we’re missing the payment.” Then he realized, “Oh yeah, I forgot to get my money.” So I offered him a check to hold while I went to get the money and come back to pay him in cash.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you go get the money and come back?\n\nDefendant: Because when I went back out with the car, that’s when all the problems started.\n\nJudge: The second you drove off, the car started having problems?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t call him and say, “Give me my money back. I want to return the car”?\n\nDefendant: Oh no, I did call them several times. Not the same day, but within two or three days.\n\nJudge: But you were supposed to pay him in cash the next day. If the problems didn’t start for two or three days, why wasn’t he already paid?\n\nDefendant: Because the car started having problems.\n\nJudge: Why? Because you got the title and the car?\n\nDefendant: No, because the car had issues. I asked him to come to my place of business multiple times, and I mentioned there was an issue with the engine. He told me it wasn’t covered under the warranty.\n\nJudge: When did he come to your business?\n\nDefendant: About three days after the sale.\n\nJudge: So he came looking for his money, and you said, “Oh, the car has issues,” and then you refused to pay. Would you ever give someone the title to a car without getting full payment?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: You’re sure?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: The title makes the car yours, right? Would you ever in a million years do that?\n\nPlaintiff: Definitely not. I would want my money before giving the title.\n\nJudge: And why is that?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I wouldn’t want to give something away without getting anything in return. You lose your leverage.\n\nJudge: Exactly. Going inside the courtroom, you spoke to Mr. Rossi many times?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I even went to his work and spoke to his supervisor. The supervisor told me, “Carlos, don’t worry. Take it to court.”\n\nJudge: Unbelievable. And he still has his job?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have a warranty on this 1997 Nissan Quest?\n\nDefendant: Yes, there was a limited warranty on the slip that came with the car.\n\nJudge: Let me see. It’s not even filled out. Was this blank, and then he filled it out?\n\nDefendant: No, that’s how it was when I got it.\n\nJudge: This doesn’t do you any good. And you don’t even pay for a car, but you want a warranty? I’m done. He owes you the money. I rule in favor of the plaintiff for $1,100. Pay the man.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Evasion, deflection, gaslighting, playing the victim"}
{"id": "436", "dialogue": "Judge: Thomas hen, you're suing Robert Eckles for $1,750 that you say you are out as a result of him selling you a defective refrigerator. You are counter claiming against him how much?\nDefendant: 800.\nJudge: Okay gentleman, what happened?\nPlaintiff: Thank you sir. Towards the beginning of November my refrigerator started acting up and I realized I'm going to need one soon so I went on Craigslist to try to find a used refrigerator. I wanted the stainless steel front so I called Robert Eckles and he also had agreed to deliver the refrigerator to my door which was a plus so I agreed to buy his refrigerator. I was insistent on when I was having a conversation with him just making sure it was a working refrigerator that's all I asked and he led me to believe that it was working.\nJudge: How what did he say?\nPlaintiff: He just told me yeah, he said yeah he said he had it operational before.\nJudge: He had it operational how long before?\nPlaintiff: He didn't tell me. Also, I have a tendency to believe that he had it installed at a job that he was doing because the picture that he has on Craigslist, the background sheetrock has some tape and spackle on it so I believe it was probably at a job might not have been working so well and he decided to get rid of it.\nJudge: Well you're just making that part up.\nPlaintiff: Yeah, surmising.\nJudge: So what happens he brings the refrigerator over, don't you test it?\nPlaintiff: Yes we did. So we brought the refrigerator over to my house. Now with all refrigerators everyone understands that it needs a certain amount of time - 24 to 48 hours to let the refrigerator acclimate before it'll reach its final temperature so we did plug it in the temperature was in the...\nJudge: Wait everyone knows that? Because I didn't know that.\nPlaintiff: When you purchase a refrigerator, a new refrigerator, used refrigerator you need to plug in the refrigerator and let it sit where it's going to be installed because when you - there's Freon involved.\nJudge: So then I have a very simple question - did you know that before you bought this one?\nPlaintiff: Sure yeah.\nJudge: So why didn't you just drive to where the refrigerator was, plug it in and then for a day and then you go that next day instead and then you test it and then you see whether it works and then you buy it?\nPlaintiff: He had explained to me that the refrigerator was now in his work truck tied up in his work truck so it needed to be moved anyway it needed to be brought to the final resting place of the...\nJudge: If it needs to be tested for 24 hours before you know if it works why didn't you test it for 24 hours whether it's take it off the work truck bring the work truck to a source?\nPlaintiff: You know, I mean there's things that could be done. I mean...\nJudge: Out way right it's a very good point.\nPlaintiff: I to be honest I didn't even...\nJudge: All right so what's wrong with this refrigerator were you trying to unload it because it doesn't work?\nDefendant: No I bought this refrigerator off of a job. I'm a cabinet maker and I bought off the job from the Builder.\nJudge: Why was the person selling it?\nDefendant: They renovated their kitchen.\nJudge: Oh this is the one that had been in there. Well where was this picture taken?\nDefendant: That was in my home I bought it from my home.\nJudge: And but why is there like a wall in process?\nDefendant: Right behind my kitchen was under renovation.\nJudge: So did you have it in your kitchen?\nDefendant: Yeah.\nJudge: And then what?\nDefendant: I never plugged it in. I explained to Tom that...\nJudge: Wait you never plugged it in from the job ever you never used this ref...\nDefendant: Never did. I bought it as the future when I'm done with building my cabinets I was going it was going to be my refrigerator.\nJudge: Right.\nDefendant: I bought it as is from a builder he said that the cabinet maker has no cabinets.\nJudge: I had no cabinets for how long have you had no cabinets?\nDefendant: It's been a while.\nJudge: You live without a kitchen?\nDefendant: It's a makeshift kitchen temporary.\nJudge: All right do you live alone?\nDefendant: Now I do yeah.\nJudge: Can't imagine why. All right go on.\nDefendant: So I bought it from I bought it from the Builder he said it was working prior to when he was selling the kitchen to the woman that we were doing the job for so I took it under that it worked it was fine so I bought it, brought it home obviously my kitchen's not done I didn't want to use it I already had a refrigerator it was going to be for the future so I put it in the kitchen up against the wall and there it sat for about 2 years. I explained to him that I had never plugged it in that was my future refrigerator.\nJudge: So in the beginning how this whole... I have a question why doesn't anybody test stuff before they... am I like crazy or something? I would if especially if I had this like specialty knowledge that you have to wait 24 hours I would insist plug the thing in and it's was it on your work truck and therefore he couldn't plug it in?\nDefendant: He could have he could have said to me listen come tomorrow plug it in tonight you can come look at it tomorrow I would have let him.\nJudge: He like I just don't get why people don't do that why aren't people more careful and then they're clogging up my court system you know. So what happens you plug it in for an hour looks good to me here's your money goodbye and then after the other 23 hours it's not getting cold enough?\nPlaintiff: Exactly. I called up Robert Eckles I explained to him that the refrigerator was not working properly and he told me oh you bought it as is and I said listen I kept on asking you I said all I want is an operational refrigerator I must have said it 10 times during this time I had also speaking about my attorney about what my options were because I bought a refrigerator on Craigslist that wasn't working and he told me you need to get two estimates to find out what's wrong with it.\nJudge: What's wrong with it?\nPlaintiff: It's a coil condenser and on Subzero refrigerators it's inoperable it's...\nJudge: Why why can't you replace a coil condenser you know what it is?\nPlaintiff: A refrigerator it's a huge refrigerator it's a top of the line refrigerator it's they just don't repair them they don't repair the coil.\nJudge: Not true I own Sub Zeros all my life I I've seen how many times a repair man has to come out.\nPlaintiff: I've spoken to three people and they all tell me that a CO...\nJudge: Give give me what you have I I just have a letter here give me whatever you have to prove your case.\nDefendant: When I talked to him he told me he got an estimate for $500 that it could be repaired for $500.\nPlaintiff: Oh no that's not true.\nJudge: You know what I have to tell you I don't care if it can be repaired for $5 or $500 I care whether you made a warranty or you didn't. In other words it's not up to you to decide no just put a few more hundred into it either you gave him a warranty and told him the thing guaranteed to him the thing was working or you didn't because you told him I haven't plugged it in in two years and you know when you buy a used item like how much you know according to you saying all I want is an operational refrigerator and him telling you yeah yeah it used to work two years ago is a guarantee that it's going to work this moment without you taking the most minimal efforts where's the stuff about the you got two estimates cuz your lawyer told you?\nPlaintiff: I don't have the estimates I had them I didn't bring them with me I apologize but the person who sent the notarized letter there that's...\nJudge: Wait let me see if I've got this you've got proof that it is absolutely worthless and that you must get your money back but you didn't bring it to court even though a lawyer told you to go get it? Tough luck for this guy tough luck. I think if you buy anything secondhand you know you do run the risk of problems with it especially if you don't test it out properly.\nDefendant: Exactly Rod.\nJudge: Okay that's enough said going inside the courtroom what is your counter claim about?\nDefendant: It's just time loss he also...\nJudge: Time lost what today and then don't be silly why would you get $800 for being here today?\nDefendant: Okay.\nJudge: No on your counter claim zero what about oh let's see what you're suing for $800 for the refrigerator $500 for loss of food I don't understand you had the other refrigerator there why would you have any loss of food you're still testing the refrigerat...\nPlaintiff: Okay by it's always...\nJudge: All right you're still testing the refrigerator to see if it works it's hour 24 now you see that it doesn't but you lost 500 dollars worth of food show me the pictures of $500 worth of food spoiled.\nPlaintiff: I'll show you two months receipts of food bills.\nJudge: Really and a guy might have that and eat the food right so that wouldn't be too probative all right and then what else do we have Mr liar $250 for two estimates 125 per estimate let me see the $125 for each to the estim...\nPlaintiff: Those are the those are estimates no no...\nJudge: I didn't ask you to Flap your gums again I'm asking you to prove your lawsuit.\nPlaintiff: Previously stated I explained that I don't have those two pieces of paper those...\nJudge: So how do you expect to prove your case?\nPlaintiff: Well he said he sold me a refrigerator and...\nJudge: No besides repeating yourself how do you expect to...\nPlaintiff: All right your honor also in the truck...\nJudge: Do you really think you need to talk anymore?\nPlaintiff: I really don't.\nJudge: Then don't. Okay I find in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff's claim against the defendant I find you have absolutely nowhere any information that he guaranteed to you that this item would work like new when you buy a new a used item it is buyer beware you know it's buyer beware you even know exactly what you have to do but you were too lazy to do it Li stop talking you're a liar about the loss of food you're a liar about the estimates and I want you to go away and finding in favor of the defendant ask for your counter claim against him which is equally ridiculous zero then.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff ", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, deflection, gaslighting, emotional appeal"}

{"id": "259", "dialogue": "Judge:\nThis is the plaintiff, Jared Wisneski. He says the defendant knowingly sold him a car with a bad head gasket. He took terrible advantage of him, and he's suing today seeking justice. He spent $1,269.31—the defendant royally ripped him off, and he wants the defendant to take the car back and refund his money.\n\nThis is the defendant, Lee Birchard. He says the plaintiff is his friend’s son, and the guy needed a car. He had an extra car sitting around, so he gave him a great deal. A few months later, the plaintiff called him, ranting and raving, because he was driving the car and the gasket and engine blew. He had no control over the car once he sold it to the plaintiff. He didn’t give him a warranty or anything like that, and he’s sorry, but this guy is simply out of luck because he’s not taking the car back.\n\nHe’s accused of unloading a bad car.\n\nAll parties, please be ready.\n\nWelcome back to The People's Court.\n\nNext case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant screwed him over royally by selling him a car with a bad head gasket. But the defendant says he got a great deal, so tough.\n\nIt’s the case of Blowing a Big Old Gasket.\n\nThank you, Douglas.\n\nMr. Wisneski, you are suing Lee Birchard for $1,269.31. You want him to pay you part of that as a refund on a car that you no longer want, and the rest is for the sums you spent to get it registered and insured.\n\nOkay, what’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff (Jared Wisneski):\nAlright, well, um, I went to Mr. Birchard’s house on—I believe it was July 15th or 16th—to initially look at the vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you know he had a vehicle for sale?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI had actually been keeping tabs on the vehicle over a course of time. I had been asking his son, Dylan, if the car—\n\nJudge:\nHis son?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, that is correct.\n\nJudge:\nIs this his son?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, that’s not the son.\n\nJudge:\nWho’s that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat’s his oldest son.\n\nJudge:\nAnother son, just not the Dylan son.\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, go on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I’d been asking Dylan about the car over the course of months, and he said his father hadn’t sold it. And I said, “Okay.” I was looking to get my driver’s license back.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you lose your driver’s license?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was written a ticket that I didn’t have insurance—when I really did—but—\n\nJudge:\nSo why didn’t you just fix it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, I attempted to, and it just—there was a long snowball effect.\n\nJudge:\nDid you go to court and try to—?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have your license now?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah, I have it now.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happens then?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, so I went and inquired about the vehicle at Mr. Birchard’s house. We were taking a look at it. It looked very nice on the outside. Interior was very clean. It was a 1997 Mercury Sable.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd he popped the hood for me, and things didn’t look bad under the hood. But then when he got—\n\nJudge:\nHow are you qualified to figure out if something looks bad under the hood? Like, what is it? Pretty? Like, what do you mean when you say that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, nothing looked—\n\nJudge:\nDid you have a mechanic take a look at the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, no.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, uh, he popped the hood on it, we looked under, and then he got in the driver’s seat, stuck the key in the ignition—and the car didn’t start.\n\nJudge:\nDidn’t start?\n\nPlaintiff:\nDidn’t start.\n\nJudge:\nDidn’t start.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo after a little while of talking, we decided that he was going to—he said he was going to call a mechanic friend of his to take a look at it, and, uh, he’d let me know in a couple of days.\n\nJudge:\nHow long had the car been sitting there?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe car had been off the road for about a year.\n\nJudge:\nFor a whole year?\n\nDefendant (Lee Birchard):\nHadn’t been started?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nDefendant:\nIt got started two, three, four times a week.\n\nJudge:\nYou would just start it and then turn it off?\n\nDefendant:\nI would leave it running. Sometimes it ran for over an hour.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, that sounds like—\n\nJudge:\nJust because?\n\nDefendant:\nI multitask.\n\nJudge:\nSo you forgot?\n\nDefendant:\nYeah, yeah, I multitask.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s what I’m going to call it whenever I forget something.\n\nDefendant:\n[Laughs]\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so it didn’t start. So what did you do to it?\n\nDefendant:\nI had a friend of mine look at it. He said that it was a starter. I went and bought a new starter. Put the starter in. Didn’t start. Checked the battery—turned out it was the battery.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. So in any event, then you end up selling it to him?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nHe sells it to you for how much?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$780.\n\nJudge:\nSo then you take the car. When do you take the car? What month?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, I purchased the car on July 19th, and then me and his son, Dylan, were actually working out how we were going to get the vehicle towed to my house, because I could not legally take this car for a test drive or drive it, period, ’cause it wasn’t registered or insured.\n\nJudge:\nDid you sign any paperwork when the car was sold?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, I signed a bill of sale.\n\nJudge:\nMay I see the bill of sale?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, I don’t even know if I have it.\n\nJudge:\nNo?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI don’t have it.\n\nJudge:\nFor the amount of $50? Why does it say $50 when we all know you paid $700 or $780?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhen he wrote it up, he said he was going to write it up that way to save me money on tax purposes.\n\nJudge:\nOh, tax cheating?\n\nPlaintiff:\n[No response].   Judge:\nOh. Okay. So now you get the car. You don’t drive it because you don’t have your license yet?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, no, I didn’t have it registered or insured yet.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. So at what point does the car become a problem for you?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, well, I had the car registered and insured August 5th.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, I was only able to drive the vehicle for a period of four days before it completely broke down.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, the first thing that started happening was the temperature gauge on the dashboard started fluctuating up and down.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, I actually stopped over at his house—his other son, Jacob, was there—and I asked him, “Hey, I just bought this car from your father, and the temperature gauge is going crazy. Do you think I should be concerned?”\n\nAnd he looked at me, and he said, “You should be very concerned.”\n\nJudge:\nOh.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, uh, I went home, and the next day, I took it to a shop to have it looked at. And that’s when I was told that the head gasket was blown.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what is the cost of the repair?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, $1,200.\n\nJudge:\nSo did you call him and say, “Hey, the head gasket’s blown?”\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe said, “There’s nothing I can do for you.”\n\nJudge:\nAlright. Now, Mr. Birchard, do you have any knowledge of the head gasket being blown prior to selling him the car?\n\nDefendant (Lee Birchard):\nAbsolutely not.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. The car is a 1997 Mercury Sable?\n\nDefendant:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nSo a 23-year-old car.\n\nDefendant:\nYep.\n\nJudge:\nWith how many miles on it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUh, I believe it had about 140,000 miles.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. And did you sell the car “as is”?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, I did.\n\nJudge:\nWas there anything in writing that said “as is”?\n\nDefendant:\nUh, I wrote “as is” on the bill of sale.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. Now, Mr. Wisneski, what makes you think that he should take the car back?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause I was under the impression that I was buying a running and driving vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nBut it did run and drive.\n\nPlaintiff:\nFor four days.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Well, let me explain something to you. If you buy a car and it is sold “as is,” that means if it lasts you four minutes, that’s your problem. If it lasts you four years, that’s your problem. You don’t get to come back and say, “I want my money back,” because you bought it as is. That means you had an opportunity to have a mechanic check it out, and you didn’t.\n\nAnd now, because it didn't work out for you, you want me to undo the sale. I don't have the power to do that.\n\nI don't see anything in the evidence that would indicate that he knew the head gasket was blown and deliberately sold it to you to deceive you.\n\nPlaintiff:\nBut, Your Honor, I only got to drive it for four days—\n\nJudge:\nAnd that’s your problem. If you buy a used car “as is,” you assume the risk. If you want a guarantee, you buy from a dealer with a warranty.\n\nJudgment in favor of the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, deflection, emotional appeal"}
{"id": "400", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nBailiff: Be seated. Come to order in the matter of Goldstein v. Feli. Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Ashley Goldstein, you are suing your former roommate Christine Feli for $532.58 in utility bills that you say she owes you for her half and has refused to pay.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Basically, back in October 2011, we moved into a house together.\n\nJudge: Had you known each other before that?\n\nPlaintiff: We had been best friends for 11 years. We met in ninth grade. Not just close friends, best friends. We were always together.\n\nJudge: Well, that's sad.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, a little bit. So basically, we moved in, everything was fine, but as time went on, we started fighting over little things. She was kind of a big slob, and so I'd argue about that.\n\nDefendant: I would spend hours cleaning my house.\n\nJudge: But if you're best friends, you know she's a slob.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, if I'm not saying you're a slob, I'm saying you know, you think she's a slob. I mean, I know my best friend's habits. I've been in her house, seen where she lives. I know.\n\nJudge: So you should have known?\n\nPlaintiff: I guess I should have. I mean, her house at her mom's was messy too, but I addressed that as one of my concerns before moving in. She assured me she'd clean up after herself.\n\nJudge: And did she?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I would spend hours cleaning the house, and then I'd come home, and there'd be dishes everywhere, stuff everywhere. The house would be disgusting. Then we argued about the heat. She liked it at 62, which is too low for me, so I'd turn it up to 64, 65, 66. She had an issue with that and said, \"You're wasting our heat. I'm not going to pay it if you keep it this high.\"\n\nJudge: When did she move out?\n\nPlaintiff: The second week of April or the first week of April. Maybe March 26th. Her rent had been paid up to that point.\n\nJudge: Had she paid April rent?\n\nPlaintiff: April rent ended up being covered by her half of the security deposit, which the landlord accepted as payment. Well, he didn't accept it entirely. He's taking her to court too.\n\nJudge: He's taking her to court for what?\n\nPlaintiff: She left before the lease was up—it was up in October.\n\nJudge: And now he's coming after you for it?\n\nPlaintiff: Hopefully not, but he said he was going to.\n\nJudge: I'm telling you right now, unless this landlord has a screw loose, they’re not going to go to court on a roommate situation over one person’s unpaid rent. They’ll just go after whoever is still there.\n\nPlaintiff: We both signed the lease. It says on line 18 that we are responsible for heat and electric. My mother and the landlord were both present when we agreed to split the bills.\n\nJudge: Why am I here? I don’t want to hear about who’s a slob, who doesn’t do dishes, or complaints about boyfriends. Why am I here?\n\nPlaintiff: Because she didn’t pay her half of the electric bill.\n\nJudge: And for what months?\n\nPlaintiff: The only month she paid since we moved in was December.\n\nJudge: Let me see your bills. At this point, how are you two getting along?\n\nPlaintiff: We weren’t talking.\n\nJudge: I mean, in January, February, March—when she wasn’t paying, how were you getting along?\n\nPlaintiff: At that time, we were getting along. But about a month and a half before she moved out, we got into a big argument.\n\nJudge: About what?\n\nPlaintiff: The same things—heat, messiness, little things that spiraled out of control. We said hurtful things to each other.\n\nJudge: Had you ever said hurtful things before and then gotten over it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but not like this. Her boyfriend got involved, too, saying hurtful things to my mother.\n\nJudge: What did he say to your mother?\n\nPlaintiff: My mom texted him because he was saying mean things to me. She told him to stay out of it and said, \"They fight like sisters, they’ll probably get over it.\"\n\nJudge: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He called me \"scum of the Earth,\" \"disgusting,\" and said, \"nobody likes you.\"\n\nJudge: Let me hear your side.\n\nDefendant: We had issues before moving in. We were best friends, but we knew it could be a problem. We agreed that if things were going well, we’d continue living together. I paid half of the RG&E bill, which was in her name. October, November, December, everything was fine. I gave her cash for my half.\n\nJudge: And after that?\n\nDefendant: In December, she started dating a guy who was into serious drugs. She found a spoon in his car for heroin use and forgave him. I felt unsafe. He had a criminal record, and I started staying at my boyfriend’s house six to seven days a week. Then she finally left him, filed a police report, and got an order of protection because he slashed her tires.\n\nJudge: When was that?\n\nDefendant: Late January. She filed the police report in February.\n\nJudge: So what happened next?\n\nDefendant: She invited me to breakfast, but I wasn’t feeling well. Then I started getting text messages—she was upset I wasn’t home enough. She accused me of lying, got really needy, and then things escalated. She broke into my room, trashed it, and sent me a picture of the mess.\n\nJudge: Let me see the texts. (Reviews them.) You do sound a little needy, accusing her of lying. But that doesn’t determine a lawsuit. You’re suing her for unpaid utilities. She’s saying she wasn’t living there. What’s your response to that?\n\nPlaintiff: She was still on the lease. She hadn’t officially moved out.\n\nJudge: On what legal theory are you not responsible for utilities before moving out?\n\nDefendant: I wasn’t living there for three months.\n\nJudge: You may have chosen to stay elsewhere, but if you haven’t moved out, you’re still living there.

{"id": "171", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff was the defendant’s boyfriend, but no more. He gave her his credit card for a Lazy Boy. What do you think happened there? She says it was a present, but now that she’s seeing someone else, he’s upset. It’s the case of \"You’re Way Too Lazy for Me.\" Thank you.\n\nJudge: John Cerk, you are suing your former girlfriend, Joellen Reich, for $487.52, the amount that you say you loaned to her. You say he gave it as a gift, and according to you, she's refusing to repay. What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, sometime last summer, I think it was July or August, she purchased furniture, and it was one of those deals with little or no interest. Come December, she asked me to loan her the money to pay off the loan. She needed $300, and I was kind of reluctant. She said she'd pay me when she gets her taxes in January. So, I gave her my credit card. I get the bill—it’s for $487.52. Come January, I ask for my money, and she tells me I have to stand in line, you know.\n\nJudge: But this isn't a stranger to you; this is somebody who you dated. How long?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, probably for 10 years.\n\nJudge: 10 years? Okay, so you were together for 10 years. When did you guys break up?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, it's been on and off for 10 years. You know, it’s a love-hate relationship, I guess you call it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Right now, are you on, or are you off?\n\nPlaintiff: No, we’re off.\n\nJudge: When was the last time you were on?\n\nPlaintiff: December.\n\nJudge: And who broke up with who?\n\nDefendant: It just happened, you know.\n\nJudge: Who broke up with who?\n\nDefendant: He made me mad, so—\n\nJudge: Say that again?\n\nDefendant: I probably broke up with him.\n\nJudge: He made you mad? How did he make you mad?\n\nDefendant: He was just mean to me. I had just got off work, and he brought up a fight that we had the night before. I had just worked eight hours and saw him, and he was still carrying the same thing from the night before.\n\nJudge: And you guys were living together?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Oh. Okay, so that was it? After 10 years?\n\nDefendant: It’s always something stupid. It’s just the last straw of something.\n\nJudge: All right. He says that he paid this off as a loan to you and that you’re supposed to pay him back. What’s your answer to that?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. Tell me your side.\n\nDefendant: He’s helped me for 10 years. When I left my son’s father, he lost his job. I was getting child support, but when my son’s father got fired, I didn’t get child support anymore. Back in the day, John used to give me money—$500 cash. When I moved in August, he gave me his credit card so I could buy new things for the house. That was $300. He’s helped me a lot in the past 10 years and never asked me for anything back.\n\nJudge: And out of curiosity, once you two broke up, he asked for this back. You didn’t want to pay it because you can’t pay it?\n\nDefendant: Well, his claim said that I was supposed to pay him back in 30 days.\n\nJudge: Did you ever tell him you’d pay him back for this?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: I understand what you’re saying—you’re trying to tell me, \"Judge, he’s given me lots of gifts. This was just another gift.\"\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. Why do you suppose he wants this one paid? What is he mad at you for that would make him say this one wasn’t a gift?\n\nDefendant: I started dating somebody else.\n\nJudge: Ah, that’s the part I was missing, honey. Now I get it. All right. Does this guy get his money back? What do you think? If you make a loan, you have to have it in writing. You’re not getting your money back. Fair enough—it doesn’t feel like a loan to me. Going inside the courtroom—so you are dating somebody else?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Are you living with somebody else?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: After 10 years, you never lived with him?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Was that an issue, or is that just the way you two rolled?\n\nDefendant: I’ve always wanted— you know, it’s lonely. I’ve been alone for 12 years.\n\nJudge: Apparently, he thinks you rebounded a little quickly.\n\nDefendant: Oh.\n\nJudge: Is he suspicious of you?\n\nDefendant: Oh, I wasn’t cheating on him.\n\nJudge: Okay, but does he think that?\n\nDefendant: I don’t think so.\n\nJudge: You think it’s just that he wants the money because he’s mad that you moved on?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have any evidence that this was a loan?\n\nPlaintiff: I have nothing but her word.\n\nJudge: Her word here today is directly contrary to yours.\n\nPlaintiff: I know it is.\n\nJudge: And we just took that oath five minutes ago to tell the truth.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m telling the truth.\n\nJudge: Are you telling the truth?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: When you come to court, it’s really important to have something other than a he said/she said because it becomes very difficult to rule in your favor when you have the burden of proof and can’t meet it. My verdict in this case, I have no choice but to rule for the defendant.

{"id": "973", "dialogue": "JUDGE: This is the plaintiff, Jean Claude Felder. He says he brought his truck into the defendant's shop for a tune-up. A few days later, it overheated, and he brought the truck back and was charged another $1,500 for some additional repairs. It needed a few days later, it overheated again, and when he brought it back, the defendant told him he now needed a new engine. A new engine? Why did this guy charge him thousands of dollars and string him along when he knew he was going to need a new engine? He is suing for $5,000, the amount he's owed.\n\nJUDGE: This is the defendant, John Sa. He says the truck had almost 200,000 miles on it and was in bad shape when the plaintiff brought it in. The plaintiff drove it another 400 miles after he made the repairs, then he blew the head gasket on the engine. Well, he's sorry, but he has no way of knowing when an engine is going to blow. The truck is 16 years old, and he's not responsible for paying the plaintiff a penny. He's accused of making unnecessary repairs.\n\nJUDGE: All parties, please rise. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff brought his truck to the defendant’s shop, says he was totally scammed, overcharged, and the car got screwed up to boot. The defendant says it had 200,000 miles—give me a break. It's the case of blowing a gasket. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nBAILIFF: You’re welcome.\n\nJUDGE: Jean Claude Felder?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: You are suing Vanderbilt Auto Care, represented by John Sa. You’re the owner?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, for $5,000 that you say they should pay you for lost wages, faulty repairs, and aggravation. Okay, how old is your car?\n\nPLAINTIFF: It’s a 2000, so it’s like 14, 15 years old.\n\nJUDGE: Chevrolet pickup?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Okay, how many miles does it have?\n\nPLAINTIFF: 196,000 miles.\n\nJUDGE: That’s a lot.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah, it is a lot of miles.\n\nJUDGE: Did you get it that way, or did you use it that way?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I got it that way, but it’s a Chevy. It’s a workhorse.\n\nJUDGE: What do you do that you drive so much?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I’m a plumber.\n\nJUDGE: All right, so what happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF: So first, I got the tune-up. Then, over the weekend, it broke down, it overheated.\n\nJUDGE: That was not a problem you were having before?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No, I had no problems before. No overheating, nothing at all.\n\nJUDGE: So the car overheats, and then what?\n\nPLAINTIFF: So it overheats. I called John. I said, \"John, my car’s overheating.\" He said, \"Okay, bring it back.\" So I brought it back to him Monday. He kept my truck for five days. I kept calling. I said, \"John, everything okay?\" \"Yeah, yeah, I’m doing more work. I’m doing more work to it.\" On the fifth day, I got it back. He charged me $1,500.\n\nJUDGE: But during that time, he’s telling you what he’s going to change or do, right?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah.\n\nJUDGE: And what was it that was wrong with the car?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He changed some parts in the truck, like the head gasket and some other parts.\n\nJUDGE: What did you do the first time?\n\nDEFENDANT: It was a tune-up.\n\nJUDGE: So when he brought it to you the second time, why did the car overheat? Were you able to determine that?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: What was it?\n\nDEFENDANT: The intake manifold gasket was leaking antifreeze, filling up in the crankcase.\n\nJUDGE: Does that have anything to do with your original repair?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: Were you anywhere near those parts in your original repair?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: Do you feel that this truck, with 190,000 miles, at some point isn’t worth fixing?\n\nDEFENDANT: When the truck came back the third time, the head gasket was blown. That is when I stopped and told Mr. Felder—\n\nPLAINTIFF: Hold on one second.\n\nDEFENDANT: I told Mr. Felder that it’s beyond repair, it’s going to keep breaking. Get an engine if you want to keep the truck.\n\nJUDGE: Okay. The first time you brought it was what date?\n\nPLAINTIFF: January 29.\n\nJUDGE: And then you had to bring it back when?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I brought it back that Monday. I don’t know the exact date.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have paperwork for every trip?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yeah, I have every—yeah.\n\nJUDGE: Can you pull the paperwork?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\n(The conversation continues with back-and-forth discussion about repairs, mechanical issues, and evidence presented in court.)\n\nJUDGE: So here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to order him to return a portion of that bill—$800. Verdict for the plaintiff.\n\n(Verdict is delivered, and reactions from both parties are given.)\n\nJUDGE: Good luck, folks. Both sides.\n\nREPORTER: So the plaintiff gets $800 back, not the $5,000 he was seeking. Mr. Sa, how do you feel about this?\n\nDEFENDANT: I respect the judge’s decision. However, the problem with the vehicle was the intake manifold gasket at the time I examined it. Eventually, the car came back with a head gasket issue, which is a different issue. Ultimately, it’s an old car and is due for a new engine. ", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, playing the victim , emotional appeal"}

Thank you.\nJudge: Douglas Anette Martin, you are neighbors with Mr. Coleman, correct?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: How long have you been neighbors?\nPlaintiff: Uh, I've been in my home for more than 20 years. I believe he's been my neighbor for three.\nJudge: Okay. Now there's a tree in question that you are quite angry about. What happened, what according to you did he do?\nPlaintiff: Okay, so one evening in February, I drove into my driveway and I'm sitting in the car talking and Mr. Coleman approached my vehicle and he said, \"Well, the tree on the right is okay. I just want to cut the branches off of it that are hanging over to my property.\" And then he said, \"The tree in the left side is dead.\" He said, \"I had someone come and look at the tree and they told me it would cost $1,700 to take the tree down and it would cost $800 to remove the branches.\" And so I said to Mr. Coleman, \"I will need to speak to my husband and other people. Not sure that tree is dead. I need to take a look at it.\" He said, \"Okay, I'll see you on Monday.\" Monday came and went. I never saw Mr. Coleman again. He didn't... anybody. I spoke to my husband and and my parents and um, we all agreed that the tree was not dead.\nJudge: How, how does anybody know without like... All right, well, it's winter time. Trees are... the fact that there's no leaves in winter time, it's not how someone determines whether a tree is dead. You scrape and you see if there's green where you scrape or I have a tree guy tell me. Did you tell him, \"No, I don't want the tree moved,\" or you don't say anything?\nPlaintiff: We didn't see each other, so I didn't say anything.\nJudge: So what happened?\nPlaintiff: So by Friday of that week, it was February 15th, when I came home it was dark, but I looked in the backyard and I see that the tree was cut down.\nJudge: All right, so what had, what had happened?\nDefendant: Okay, um, first off, uh, it wasn't the first time I had gone to Mrs. Martin. Uh, prior to that I had had a gate removed and I went to Mrs. Martin as well as some of the other uh, adjacent neighbors and told them I was going to replace the fence. Okay? And they all were uh, you know, they all approved it and they were actually happy. Now this tree actually stands on the property line.\nJudge: On the property line?\nDefendant: Yes. And having to put up the new... when putting up the new fence, uh, the fence uh, personnel had to actually go around uh, the trees.\nJudge: Really?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: So they had to or they did?\nDefendant: They had to avoid them by going around and encroaching back onto my property to avoid the trees. So I had to write at that point to trim the trees as far as their trunks that was obscuring the line. I didn't do that just to be, you know, just out of courtesy. I left them as is. But upon living there for 2 years, 2 and a half years, I noticed that every other day debris and branches were falling onto my driveway, the... my side door, you know, where I have to use to access my home. My child accesses the backyard and the side yard. So it's, it's a... in terms of property, in terms of people, so that's when I said, you know what, I'm going to trim the trees just what hangs over my line.\nJudge: Do you have anything from an arborist saying the tree was dead?\nDefendant: Correct. No, I didn't. That I...\nJudge: If you do, then show it to me. If that is correct, you do have... Do you have anything from an arborist saying the tree was dead?\nDefendant: Not anything in writing. No.\nJudge: Well, you know, how are you going to prove that?\nDefendant: Well, again, I have the receipt from...\nJudge: No, no. That proves you paid X to kill it. That doesn't prove it was dead and that's why you killed it. This is the tree. That is the tree. It's just there two trees. Do we have a picture of this tree before it became a post?\nPlaintiff: I have it in um, Google Maps. Okay, but I can't...\nJudge: So what you see there is a tree that's on the neighbor's property that is in fact dead and they removed it. You want to go over there and show me what you're saying?\nPlaintiff: Sure, yeah.\nJudge: What tree did he cut down?\nPlaintiff: This tree. The one with all those leaves on it. Yes, it's behind this dead tree.\nJudge: This is an old photograph from Google Maps. And this tree, how old is this photograph?\nPlaintiff: 2015.\nJudge: Okay. Well, that big bushy luscious thing gave leaves like that when for the last time?\nPlaintiff: Last summer.\nJudge: Well, then why would he say that it's dead?\nPlaintiff: He's lying. I think he is.\nJudge: Okay. Go ahead and go back, uh, that she says that it's that big bushy one back there. That's not a recent photo. I have recent photos.\nDefendant: Okay. Let me see that. Go... please step over there if you would. So you could see here the new fence put up last year. So you can see this is a recent photo, right? That's the tree. Even prior to the fence being put up, you could see this arm was snapped off, broken off, the arm that stood over her property. Now the piece that's still intact is over above my property. I attempted to just trim it.\nJudge: Where did you cut it?\nDefendant: Right here below, just below where the branches are. And now you can clearly see the rot on the body of the tree.\nJudge: Is this picture taken from your yard or her yard?\nDefendant: From from my yard.\nJudge: From your yard. So this has nothing to do with the accommodation.\nDefendant: Okay. The accommodation is back here for another tree. No, there's a... there's a small accommodation for this tree first there and then another one for the second tree because this... this fence goes like this and then comes in 6 inches the rest of the way to accommodate this one.\nJudge: So this would be where the property line is?\nDefendant: Correct.\nJudge: So is a fence on the property line?\nDefendant: As far as I know. Okay.\nJudge: The new fence that he built. Is it also on the property line until he starts to accommodate trees?\nDefendant: Yes. So that means the trees are on the property line. I'm not sure. I have to get a surveyor at this point.\nJudge: Do you have a survey?\nPlaintiff: Uh, not with...\nJudge: Do you have a survey?\nPlaintiff: Not with you.\nJudge: You have a survey, but you didn't bring it to court?\nPlaintiff: Well, I didn't realize I would need that.\nJudge: Well, I don't know why you wouldn't realize that you would need that if you... if you're being sued for knocking down trees that are on the property line, they're half yours. You didn't think about that? Go ahead and go back to yours.\nJudge: So is it your position that she gave you authority that day or...?\nDefendant: Yes. Now let me tell you how the story went. When I met with her, there was no uh, \"Oh, don't do it. Let me talk to someone.\" She... she...\nJudge: She says she never told to do... never resisted. She was actually a proponent towards it. She said what I want to hear her words. What do you... Exact conversation was?\nDefendant: Okay. So I spoke to uh, a tree guy and he said, you know, the tree is dying. We need to remove the tree because the danger is, yes, storm could knock it on over into my property. \"Well, you know what? It did break off before prior and uh, something with the other neighbors before, so maybe you're right. Um, how much did they say?\" I said, \"$1,750.\" This why prices was disgusted... discussed. \"$1,750 uh, for total removal, $800 for a trim. $1,750, boy, that sounds like a lot. You know what? Maybe I can work with the $800.\" \"All right. So I tell you what. I'll come back to you on Monday and we figure out how much of it you're willing to uh, contribute.\" \"Okay, no problem.\" Came back home. Long story short, she wasn't there. So I said, \"All right. In my mind I already have permission from her. I'm going to foot the bill and pay for the tree and then if anything neighborly, we figure out the difference later.\"\nJudge: Okay. Now according to you, they trespassed on your property to cut it. Cause you never gave authority. According to you, she did give authority. She just absolutely hadn't settled what price, correct? If any she would pay towards it.\nDefendant: I promise you, Your Honor, had she said, \"No, you cannot chop the tree...\"\nJudge: You strike me as that kind of guy. When I see a fence going, you know, around trees. Because if it was me and I had a survey that showed that my fence was on the property line, the trees would be gone. And I'm entitled to put the fence on my property line.\nDefendant: So I like to preserve nature.\nJudge: Yeah, I got it. And that's fine. My concern... okay... is, you know, when you say, \"Well, I didn't say yes and I didn't say no,\" you know, I know from looking at the fence that he's the kind of guy who talks to people. So it sounds like you were all for this until the day you weren't.\nAnnouncer: Welcome back to the People's Court. Harvey Levin here. So if a tree is on your neighbor's property and it's dead and they won't cut it down and you think it could fall over on yours, can you go on their property and cut it down?\nHarvey Levin: Maybe not in their property, but they can cut what's like moving over to your property.\nAudience Member: If trespassing, you'd have to cut it down, but it happened to me. My... her tree fall under my property. I caught it and then fall under her pool. And then she came to my property trespassing and says she going to sue me. How's that?\nAnnouncer: Ladies and gentlemen, we will take a commercial break for this.\nJudge: Okay. Let's go inside the courtroom. The tree got cut and you want $600 for tree trunk removal, $100 for the planting of a new tree, and $2,400 for trespassing onto your property, right?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay. How did it hurt you to the tune of $2,400 to have somebody step onto your property?\nPlaintiff: Well, it was a very stressful situation. Yes, I discussed the previous neighbors because the... the other tree. One time the branches were hanging on that house. The previous neighbors simply cut the branches off, which is their right to do, and they never said anything to me.\nJudge: I, as far as I am looking, how is this that much different? Because we know that one branch is the one that's broken off already from the storm, and that does cause trees to rot. Okay? The... that one is over yours, and then the other one is over his yard. And if he had to accommodate it to not kill it because he's a nature lover, that... you know, I... I just don't see where you think that that cutting that tree that was half dead, that's on a property line that appears to belong to both of you, um, somehow entitles you to three grand when the part that's over your side is dead already from the storm.\nPlaintiff: It doesn't.\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting,Minimization"}

Yes?\nOh my gosh, tell me how this happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nWell, on June 23rd, which was my daughter’s birthday, we were waiting to go out—I mean, I was waiting for her to come home to go out. Then I was hearing like so much water, and I kept feeling the walls, and I’m looking up, feeling the walls, and I didn’t see anything. Then, you know, I kept hearing it coming more and more. So I went and rang Miss Williams' bell to see if anybody was home to see if they were having a leak.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nBut you were actually seeing water drip?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nNo, I heard the water. I heard water. Right, and I was just feeling the walls just in case. But everything looked pristine so far. So far. So, I rang their bell. Nobody was home, so I came back in, and it kept coming heavier and heavier. I sat down and I looked up, and I see water coming through my light fixture right over my bed. Dirty, mucky water coming in the light fixture.\n\nJudge:\nThe fixture is like this? So the… it's holding it?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nYes, we know that it has a finite amount of volume of water it can hold.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nExactly. I went to call the super, but he didn’t answer, left a message, and immediately I called the fire department because I figured light fixture, you know, we don’t know. So they came in about 5 to 10 minutes. The super showed up after. And when I got back in the house after letting them in, part of the ceiling was coming down. So the firemen poked it, and they saw it coming down because they poked it, and then, I know when they poked it, everything falls.\n\nJudge:\nWater’s coming down?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nRight in the rush of water. Yes, with a rush of water and dirty water and toilet water.\n\nJudge:\nYou have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nYes, I have more on my iPhone, but this is... sorry, if you need to see them, I have more, but that's just more of my mattress. Ah… here are the buckets, the pieces of the ceiling. What is this? A picture of?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nOh, that’s the hole. This is your ceiling and that’s the hole. Yes, yeah, that’s... uh, is your mattress—what kind of mattress was it?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nNice one. It’s a Sealy. It’s very comfortable, BeautyRest.\n\nJudge:\nOh my gosh, that’s your mattress. Now, that’s your mattress. How many days later?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nThat same day.\n\nJudge:\nOh, the dirt from all of the residue once the water dried up?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nRight. That’s not the... oh, wow.\n\nJudge:\nHow do you find out something has gone terribly wrong in your apartment?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nWhat happened was I was due to work at 7:00. I went to work at 7:00. I called my husband to see where he was. He was at a family member’s house. I called my oldest daughter to see where she was. She had just got off the train at 34th Street, and my middle daughter was still at work.\n\nJudge:\nWhy are you giving me all these details?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nBecause I’m getting to the point.\n\nJudge:\nGet to the point, you promise?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo one was home.\n\nJudge:\nNo one was home?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo one was home.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, good. No one was home. What time did the firemen come?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nThey came at approximately 8:30 at night.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, okay, go on.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nI got a phone call at work around 8:30, and my neighbor next to me, she says, “Is someone home?” I said, “No.” She said, “Because the fire department’s here.” When she said fire department, I thought it was a fight.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nShe said, “The fire department is here, and they’re trying to go through the fire escape.” So then I’m trying to call my husband, and my husband’s not answering his phone, of course not. And so I call my neighbor back, and I’m asking her, “What’s going on now?” She said, “Well, they’re breaking your door down.”\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nRight. She said, “They’re going to break the door down.” So finally, my husband calls me back. I said, “Look, you have to get home because the fire department’s breaking the door down.” Right, I know, but then you come home, and what do you see in your apartment?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nSo, the toilet overflows. Is the tenant’s new toilet overflow automatically respond of course? I mean, it’s their fault that everything’s breaking.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nRight. You all agree with that, huh?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nYou have no way of tracing who or where, if they're all connected? So it’s the landlord’s responsibility. Is the tenant ever responsible?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo, I’m a landlord, and I know the tenant’s never responsible.\n\nJudge:\nTampons. Tampons.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nI just want to say that going inside the courtroom. So, I left my job around 11:30.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, now we’ll get to the apartment.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nOkay, when I get to my apartment, my whole door is off the hinges.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nRight? Right, and there was water all over the place.\n\nJudge:\nIt came from your apartment?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nIt came from the bathroom toilet. The toilet in the bathroom. What happens is, from time to time, the water will back up.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nHave you called your landlord about this?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nThey come, and they’ll snake it, the toilet and the tub, and it’s fine, and then it happens again. It just happened again last week.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did the fire department do? Do you have the fire department’s report?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did your landlord say about this? You guys are renters, right? These are not condos. What did your landlord say about this?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nMy landlord said it was coming from their toilet and that the toilet had backed up.\n\nJudge:\nNo, but I mean, did you ever say to your landlord, “You’ve got to pay for these damages?”\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nYes, I asked them about that, and they said they let the toilet overflow.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s usually a plumbing problem, right?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did the landlord tell you?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNow you’ve got to go sue her.\n\nJudge:\nYes, right. That it wasn’t anything that they did. Are you responsible for the plumbing in the building? Is she responsible for the plumbing in the building?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nOkay, there are things that someone could do. Okay, for example, if you have old plumbing, and you’re living in an old building, and the landlord tells you not to flush whatever down there, and you’re still flushing whatever, then you created a problem. If you have a fight when you knock the toilet off, then you’ve caused the problem, you know? There are numerous things that you could do to cause a problem.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I need some evidence that she did something. Okay? Because the single most common, most logical reason would be that there’s a plumbing problem. And if there’s a plumbing problem, you need to be suing the landlord. And the landlord is a liar when they tell you, “Oh, it’s not us. You’ve got to sue her.” You know? No, you have to prove they did something when there’s an overflow like this. Unless there’s some evidence, and I’m looking at the fire report, and in the fire report, all it says is, “We broke in and we turned the water off.” That doesn’t mean she did something. You know, if there’s a problem with the toilet, then that’s a landlord issue.\n\nJudge:\nWell, the only thing I can say at that point is that after a week of this happening, because nobody ever came down to apologize or anything, after a week of this happening, Miss Williams came down and said that her daughter had come in, went to the bathroom, and left the house.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nOkay, but that’s... don’t you do that?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nDon’t I do that? We go into our homes, we use the bathroom, and we leave.\n\nJudge:\nRight. Right?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nI don’t know about you, but unless there’s some reason to, I don’t use the toilet and stand there and stare to see how it’s doing afterwards.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, you know, if you can prove that the landlord knew about a plumbing problem and neglected it and whatever else, then you can go against the landlord. But I just don’t... I’m not seeing anything that would mean negligence on the part of someone who rents up there. I just don’t see it.\n\nJudge:\nMy verdict in this case is for the defendant. I feel awful for you, but I just, you know, I can’t pin it on her.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nOkay, well, I think not only the judge feels awful.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nEverybody... nobody wants that. Must have been... I didn’t expect that at all.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the result of the case here?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nWhy not? You understand that it’s... I understood her.\n\nJudge:\nWell, what are you going to do next?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nShe did suggest... the judge suggested you could go against the landlord.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nI’ll speak with the landlord and see. If not, I’m just out $930.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, and what’s the situation now in the place?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nIt’s all fixed, and I had to buy new furniture. So, you look up and worry about this happening again?\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nAlways. Yeah, a little paranoia there.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, hope it doesn’t.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nAlright, thanks.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, head right down there.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nAlright, come on in here.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nWhy didn’t you step on it? Why didn’t you at least go and apologize to her? She said she never heard from you.\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo, because I was working. It was at 11:30 at night.\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nDon’t you ever see her around?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nNo, because I go to work at 7:00 in the evening and I get off at...\n\nPlaintiff (Ivon Gregory):\nYou feel bad about what happened?\n\nDefendant (Karen Williams):\nYeah, I feel bad about what happened. I wish I could help her.\n\nJudge:\nSo here’s the deal, and this is such a common thing. If you have a problem in your building and it’s a plumbing problem or whatnot, you’ve got to let the landlord know. You’ve got to let him know in writing. Once the landlord is on notice, and you can prove he’s on notice, then he has a reasonable time to fix it. And if he doesn’t, the landlord is squarely on the hook.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, Playing the victim, Defendant, Gaslighting"}
{"id": "95", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Paul Mann, you're suing Darren. You've asked not to mention your last name, for $735 in damages that you say happened as a result of work that he did on your home. Tell me what happened here.\n\nPlaintiff: I'd say in 2014 I received a citation. The entrance way to the upstairs was too close to the property line and had to be moved.\n\nJudge: Wow. Did you buy it that way or did you build it?\n\nPlaintiff: I bought it that way, but nobody complained.\n\nJudge: Nobody complained, okay. So when did somebody finally complain?\n\nPlaintiff: I'd say it was a neighbor.\n\nJudge: A disgruntled neighbor.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, a disgruntled neighbor.\n\nJudge: Ah, we got to make sure our neighbors are gruntled when we have the goods on us. All right, so you hired him to fix it, correct? And the whole job was going to cost what?\n\nPlaintiff: Originally it was supposed to be $3,000, plus materials which I supplied. I gave his partner at the time my Home Depot card, and all the parts and everything that they needed they used, which was another what, more or less how much?\n\nPlaintiff: Like $1,400.\n\nJudge: Okay, but the $3,000 wasn't even enough because this wound up taking a long time. The first payment went to his partner Anthony, which he got $1,500, and then maybe a week or so later he was gone, nowhere to be found. All right, so they finally finished the project, correct? And you paid him in full?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and it's months later where I discover a problem. The first problem was that I first went to turn on the air conditioner in 2016. It wasn't working.\n\nJudge: Your air conditioner is a unit or?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it's a unit. It's a window unit directly underneath the entrance way where they did the work.\n\nJudge: And for whatever reason, you tested it and there was no power to it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, no power.\n\nJudge: Now, is this a window that they made when they moved stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: No, this is a window that was already there.\n\nJudge: Is it on the first floor or the second floor?\n\nPlaintiff: First floor.\n\nJudge: And did they do the whole siding on the side of the house?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, they were supposed to, but the first good wind blew it apart.\n\nJudge: And that's what I'm looking at here? I see blue underneath because the siding popped off.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you pay somebody to redo the siding?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How much did you pay?\n\nPlaintiff: $485.\n\nJudge: May I see the bill?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, of course.\n\nJudge: And at some point, you finally got in touch with him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He came over, looked at the siding, and I told him about the electric. He said, \"How do you know it was me?\" I said, \"Well, it was working fine up until you did the work.\"\n\nJudge: Darren, were you working on the electric work for this job?\n\nDefendant: No, I had to move a wire when I put the door in, but that wire was to the outlet, and that outlet was working when I went there. I had nothing to do with the air conditioning.\n\nJudge: But the air conditioner is on the same side where you worked, right?\n\nDefendant: The air conditioner was on the complete other side of the house. It had nothing to do with the work I did.\n\nJudge: But Paul says the outlet stopped working after your work. Do you have any response to that?\n\nDefendant: I didn't touch that outlet. It wasn't near the work I was doing.\n\nJudge: Did you do any work near that outlet?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. I only moved the upstairs outlet to install the new door. That was it.\n\nJudge: Then why is the outlet not working? The Plaintiff hired an electrician to fix it, and the electrician reported that there was missing circuitry. The bill was $250.\n\nDefendant: I can't explain that. I wasn't responsible.\n\nJudge: I'm finding for the Plaintiff in the amount of $735. Verdict for the Plaintiff.\n\nJudge: Darren, you were trying to explain something. Do you think you got your story out?\n\nDefendant: No, I don't think it would have made any difference. I did the job I was hired for.\n\nJudge: Paul, are you satisfied?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I finally got everything working the way it's supposed to be.\n\nJudge: Well, next time, consider hiring a licensed contractor.

{"id": "641", "dialogue": "Judge:\nNaisia Myers, you are suing Scott Geller and GDT Automotive. You're the owner of GDT Automotive?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nFor $2,726 that you want refunded to you—$1,500 of that a deposit that you put on a car that according to you he sold out from under you, plus $1,226 in car insurance.\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nOkay. Yes.\n\nJudge:\nTalk to me.\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nSo, originally I had looked on Craigslist because I was looking for cars, and I wanted to find something cheap that I didn't have to make payments for. So I had talked to Scott. I reached out to him on Craigslist, and he sounded like a nice guy. He said that he was willing to help me with a down payment on a car because I didn’t have it in full, but he was willing to take it in payments.\n\nJudge:\nThe deal you struck with him is that you would provide dribs and drabs until you got to $1,500 and you wouldn’t be entitled to a car until you did, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nBad idea, but anyway, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nSo that's what you do, and you get to the $1,500?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so I had met up with his assistant because that's who I was actually meeting up with. Although I talked to him, he was really not involved because I was talking to his assistant, Dana. So she was the one that I was going through, so that's who I have the text messages with and all my emails.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so when did you have the $1,500 paid up?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nJanuary 28th.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then when do you go to pick out your new car?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nWell, I looked at and looked for a new car before that date because I knew the date was coming.\n\nJudge:\nYes, you already had your car picked out.\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou had already test-driven the car and everything.\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nYes, I test drove the car, and that was actually with Scott, and we both discussed that this was the car that I planned on getting. And then the next two weeks, which was January 28th, I had planned that with Dana and I gave her the rest of the money, so that was the $1,500.\n\nJudge:\nSo there’s $1,500 on your side?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nCorrect, Your Honor. We don’t know—I don’t know sitting here today whether she came up with $1,350. I know I waited months and worked with her, holding cars for her.\n\nJudge:\nI have a simple question. What is the total amount she paid?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nI do not know, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nYou serious?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nThat’s right. She dealt with Dana. We were working with her for months.\n\nJudge:\nYou talked to Dana before coming this month?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nI don’t think it doesn’t matter. You don’t have a method of keeping control of the money your place accepts.\n\nJudge:\nAll right, so if on January 28th she pays the remaining $1,500, how do you go out and get insurance on this specific car?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nI went to—I did it, um—what day did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nI did it, um, February 11th, a little before February 11th.\n\nJudge:\nWhy is there such a gap? If you finish paying the $1,500 on January 28th, then why is there such a gap between the 28th and February 11th?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nIt was only about two weeks.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, but why is there such a gap?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nIt’s only because I was doing it based on, like, my pay period and then I had scheduled it so that I knew for a fact that I would have the money to give him to register the car and also...\n\nJudge:\nWas there any financing involved in the purchase of this car?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nI did a finance application and they told me when—was the finance application done?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nI don’t... I honestly don’t know.\n\nJudge:\nWas it at the beginning or at the end?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nIt was like in the beginning, because they told me that I got accepted for a $4,000 loan, which the total of the car was $5,500.\n\nJudge:\nAll right, so when does she pick out that car that she really wanted—the last car in question?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nYeah, I did an exception to her. I met her at Gold’s Gym or someplace ‘cause she complained about driving, went with her in the parking lot that day to please her.\n\nJudge:\nWhat day was that? Do you remember?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nWhatever she says is fine. I don’t remember. She says it’s two weeks before January 20th. That’s fine. It probably was.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so the 28th comes, she makes the payment, but she doesn't come in to do business with you ever?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nNo. I don’t remember. That day I met you in the parking lot was the last time I saw you.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever come in to sign the paperwork for the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Naisia Myers):\nI never did. There was never a contract. Originally, when I met her, it was supposed to—the contract was supposed to be written already, but it wasn't because she said that she ended up being busy.\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nI said, \"Well, I had no problem. I will sign it on the 11th.\"\n\nJudge:\nBut how do you know? You’re giggling, but how do you know it’s very unusual to send an employee to some remote location to...\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nI sent Dana to meet her in a parking lot to be nice and to help the girl. She lived far. She had two schedules. She never answered her phone. She never came in. We went crazy to try to please her, and now I’m in court. Had to take a day for my business. The whole thing is lit.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re a used car salesman in the business of selling cars. I’m having a car dealership to serve the public and do a good job.\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nOkay, but you're not a public service worker. You're here to make money too.\n\nJudge:\nI care. I'm a good person.\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nListen, you're talking to somebody who totally finds your industry a necessary thing. I know that she can't buy a car from the dealership. I know that she doesn’t have the credit to do it. I have zero problem, and I got her approved.\n\nJudge:\nI get all that and I get why, but please don’t also—I really do get tired when I hear your side saying things like it’s a public service. No, it’s because you’re going to make money too. But here's where...\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nSurvive. Yeah. Yes. Yes, you gotta eat, you gotta pay tuition, you gotta do whatever you gotta do now.\n\nJudge:\nDana is not here, and here’s my reality. I have her testifying that Dana said, \"No problem, we’re good to go. When are you going to come in? What are you going to do, blah, blah, blah?\" And that the car is hers. Dana's leaving her with the impression that the car is hers and there’s no urgency. How are you going to contradict that without Dana here?\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nWas Dana available?\n\nJudge:\nYeah, she has another job. She works for me part-time. I don’t think she’s going.\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nDo you have her cell phone?\n\nJudge:\nYeah, I can look for her cell phone.\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nI can try.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\n[Defendant calls Dana]\n\nDefendant (Scott Geller):\nNo, I’ll talk.

{"id": "834", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff bought a horse for her disabled daughter, and it didn’t look anything like the horse in the pictures—and it was injured to boot. But the defendant says the plaintiff agreed to buy Lucky sight unseen. It’s the case of ‘My Horse is a Nightmare.’\n\nJudge: Okay, Michelle Fowler Weiss, you are suing Bethany McCurley for $750. $500 is a deposit that you put on a horse and $250 is for travel expenses. According to you, the horse was not as advertised. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: My daughter has been doing barrel racing, so we were on Craigslist—\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: Her horse is currently 17, so we were looking for a younger horse to continue to grow on. So I was looking through the Craigslist ads and looking at a lot of different things when I came upon Bethany’s ad.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And I read it—\n\nJudge: How old is your daughter?\n\nPlaintiff: She is 19.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And I read through the ad. It had everything that we were looking for.\n\nJudge: Do you have the ad?\n\nPlaintiff: I do. May I see it?\n\nJudge: Okay. So what do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Earlier in March, my daughter had been videotaped on TV because of her disability and riding.\n\nJudge: What’s the nature of her disability?\n\nPlaintiff: She was born with spina bifida, so she walks with crutches and she can’t just get on a horse like a normal person. She needs a mounting block.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I sent her the video. I sent a lot of people through the Craigslist ads the same video and said, ‘Okay, your horse sounds awesome. Now, these are the limitations of my daughter. Would your horse fit that?’ Because it’s a long travel distance. And I sent it to Bethany as well.\n\nPlaintiff: And she said, ‘Yeah, everything would be fine.’ So the pictures show a very strong, stout-looking horse, similar to the one that she currently has.\n\nJudge: Do you have the picture?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And if you go to the next...\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, there we go.\n\nJudge: Oh my gosh, our paintings do look like an elephant! That’s funny. An elephant with a ball. Alright. So, she texted—I text-messaged her about price and stuff. And so, at the end of the day, you agree as follows: there’s a $500 non-refundable deposit. And that’s very clear, right? Those were the terms of the agreement.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then a $250 travel charge because you guys are how far?\n\nPlaintiff: We are about half the state—almost half the state.\n\nJudge: Yeah, about four hours?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, four-hour drive.\n\nJudge: Alright. Now, how old are you?\n\nDefendant: 17.\n\nJudge: Okay, so I assume you were involved in all this?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But it’s your horse?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright. So the horse is brought over. What happens?\n\nPlaintiff: She gets her out of the trailer. In the photo, she looks very stocky, and she gets out of the trailer and she’s thin—a lot thinner than the photos—and she looks smaller. But then she gets out and you can see that on her withers—\n\nJudge: What are withers?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s like our shoulder blade.\n\nJudge: Just point to where it is on the horse.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, got it.\n\nJudge: So what happened when the horse stepped out of the trailer?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, right away, we noticed she was much thinner than in the photos, and when she walked, she was visibly stiff. We figured it might just be the long trailer ride, but when my daughter tried to lead her around, she wouldn’t move properly.\n\nJudge: Did you call a vet at that point?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we called our vet, and he came out later that afternoon. He examined her and said she had a problem with her hip—something that didn’t just happen from the ride.\n\nJudge: Did you relay this to the defendant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I texted Bethany immediately, and she told me the horse was “just fine” and that she had “no issues” before. But that’s not what our vet said.\n\nJudge: Alright, Ms. McCurley, what’s your response?\n\nDefendant: The horse was perfectly healthy when we loaded her up. I made it very clear in the ad that there were no known health issues.\n\nJudge: But the issue is that the horse, as delivered, was not as advertised, correct?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. I believe the stiffness was due to the travel. It was a long ride, and horses get stiff. My vet checked her before we listed her for sale.\n\nJudge: Did you offer to take the horse back?\n\nDefendant: No, because the deposit was non-refundable, and I knew she was healthy. I told them to give her a few days to adjust.\n\nJudge: But they got a vet’s opinion. Did you ask for a second opinion?\n\nDefendant: No, because I didn’t think it was necessary.\n\nJudge: Okay. Here’s the problem: when you sell an animal under certain conditions—especially a working horse for a disabled rider—it needs to match the description provided. In this case, the plaintiff relied on your statements and photos. When the horse arrived and was deemed unsuitable, you refused to return the deposit. However, I find that the contract was effectively breached by misrepresentation, whether intentional or not.\n\nDefendant: But—\n\nJudge: $750 verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection ,minimization"}
{"id": "151", "dialogue": "JUDGE:\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case in the docket—the plaintiff says the defendant rented an apartment in his house and skipped out without paying all the rent, but the defendant says he paid in full. It’s the case of the rent’s too damn inaccurate.\n\nDouglas Wayne Monsky?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou are suing the defendant for $1,794.42 in damages, rent, and other items that you say were damaged when your tenant left abruptly without notice and without paying. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nHis girlfriend moved out at the end of July, beginning of August. I wouldn’t have known other than I actually went there in the beginning of August when her uncle was moving her stuff out. I was there to talk to the defendant about mowing the lawn.\n\nWe had an agreement that he would mow the lawn. Even though his girlfriend moved out in July or August, she paid most of the rent for August and September—$775 out of $800. The remaining $25 was supposed to be for mowing the lawn, but he didn’t mow the lawn.\n\nAt the end of September, when the payments from her ran out, he called me and said he was moving out. I told him I needed to show the apartment, and he said, \"No way, you can’t show the apartment.\" We bickered about it, and he finally said, \"Only if I’m there, and you have to make arrangements through me.\"\n\nJUDGE:\nThat’s exactly how you must show the apartment—only if he’s there or unless he gives permission for you to do it at any time. You have to make arrangements with him, give him notice, and he can’t unreasonably withhold it.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nThroughout October, we tried multiple times to come to an agreement. He’d say, \"This date,\" then cancel at the last second. This happened over and over. In the end, I got only one day—October 25th—for less than two hours.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid anyone show interest in the apartment?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI had two people look, but the place was totally trashed because he was still moving out. At first, I had over two dozen people interested from my advertising.\n\nJUDGE:\nWhen did you place the advertisement?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nRight away, and then again in early October.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou’re suing for the cost of advertising. Do you have proof of the advertisements?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo, October wasn’t paid, and you’re saying you couldn’t rent it for November because he unreasonably withheld permission to show it? When did you finally rent it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nDecember 1st.\n\nJUDGE:\nDefendant, what’s going on?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nYour Honor, on January 29th, he was paid $1,504 from my girlfriend to close the case between both of us. He also kept an $800 security deposit for supposed damages.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou were living there with your girlfriend, but it didn’t work out?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nYes, we were living there until mid-August.\n\nJUDGE:\nShe moved out, and rent was paid up until September. Then October and November weren’t paid?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nCorrect. October wasn’t paid because I moved out on October 31st.\n\nJUDGE:\nAccording to him, he couldn’t rent it for November because you wouldn’t allow him to show the place. Respond to that.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI gave him two months’ notice that I was moving out and a month’s notice that I wasn’t able to pay October’s rent.\n\nJUDGE:\nThat’s a big deal. What do I do with that deposit? Leave it in the bank? Pay my bills?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nAfter we moved out, I told him I had no intention of paying October. But he was paid for that when my girlfriend made the deal.\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay. Walk me through October.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nHe came twice to show the apartment. The first time, I was there with my witness. The second time, I wasn’t home, but I know he was there because I locked both locks when I left, and when I came back, only the bottom lock was locked.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid he tell you he was going in without you?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nWere you present during the first showing?\n\nWITNESS:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nWas the place a mess?\n\nWITNESS:\nWe were moving out, so there were packed boxes, but it wasn’t bad.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid you hear any discussions between them?\n\nWITNESS:\nYes. The defendant told him he wanted to be there when the place was shown.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo, the second time when he said, \"I’m going in anyway,\" why didn’t you stop him?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI didn’t want to argue with him.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid you receive a letter of demand from him?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nGive me the letter.\n\n(Reviewing document)\n\nThis is a breakdown of the charges the defendant’s girlfriend’s mother requested. Unpaid rent, floor damage, advertising, cleanup costs, garage door remote... These are the same damages you’re suing for, right?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes, but I was trying to leave her out of it.\n\nJUDGE:\nThe defendant and his girlfriend forfeited their $800 security deposit. Then she or her mother sent you an additional check for $1,504. That should cover the damages.\n\nSo, can a tenant refuse to let a landlord show the apartment before moving out? Yes, unless the lease states otherwise. But it’s common courtesy to allow it.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI wasn’t paid for the lost rent.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou received $1,504 plus the $800 security deposit. That covers October’s rent and damages. Case dismissed.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Guilt-Tripping,Exaggeration,Deflection"}
{"id": "876", "dialogue": "JUDGE: These are the plaintiffs Aries Peña and Wascar Hisano. Aries says they were tenants of the defendant for a year and a half, and let's just say it was the coldest year and a half of their lives. There was a constant heat problem. Her son got terribly sick, and when she complained, the defendant rudely told her if it wasn't warm enough, she could move. Well, that's exactly what they did, and now the guy won't return their security and moving costs. So they're suing for the $3,500 they claim they are owed.\n\nJUDGE: This is the defendant, Edward Guster. He says he can't believe the plaintiffs are suing him considering he baptized their son. He thinks the real reason they wanted to move out was because of the constant fighting with the downstairs neighbors, which stemmed from the plaintiff flushing baby wipes down the toilet, clogging up the pipes. Owe them money? No way. He’s accused of being cold—very, very cold.\n\nCOURT CLERK: All parties please raise your right hands. All have been sworn, Your Honor.\n\nJUDGE: Thank you, Douglas. Welcome, Aries Peña and Wascar Hisano. You are suing Edward Guster, your former landlord, for $1,300 for a security deposit return, plus money you put down on your new apartment and the cost of a moving truck. Okay, what happened?\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): On July 3rd, 2011, we moved into the apartment, and everything was fine until the winter came. We constantly had problems with the heat. Every time we would call and ask Mr. Edward to come over, he would check the heater. It would work one day, and then the next day, it wouldn’t. It was just on and off for that year.\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): Before the winter of 2012, we had discussed that I didn’t want the same thing to happen again. Last year, my son got sick. My son is two years old, and I don’t think any child should go through freezing cold. We constantly had to have him with his jacket on all day. If it was just us two, I wouldn’t mind so much—I would just put a jacket on—but it was my baby. And Mr. Edward would fix it one day, and then the next, it wouldn’t work again.\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): The plumber came over several times and said there was an option: either get a second boiler for the separate apartment upstairs or turn up the heat and let the downstairs neighbor shut her heat off so it could rise to the second floor. But that never happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): Eventually, the heat went out again, and I told my husband, \"Listen, I need you to call him because I can’t do this anymore.\" When he called, the defendant said, \"If you’re not happy with the heat that we’re providing, you can move.\"\n\nJUDGE: Were you on a month-to-month lease, or was it a year-long lease?\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): The lease was for two years, but it was never signed.\n\nJUDGE: Was the lease ever signed?\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): To be honest, Your Honor, we couldn’t find one that my wife had signed.\n\nJUDGE: So then you were month-to-month.\n\nDEFENDANT (EDWARD GUSTER): They did sign it. We just can’t find the original.\n\nJUDGE: If there’s no signed lease, then it’s month-to-month. Go on.\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): When my husband called, he asked, \"What are we going to do about the deposit?\" And the defendant said, \"When you move out, we’ll look at the apartment, and if everything’s okay, we’ll give you your deposit back.\"\n\nJUDGE: Did you tell him then that you were moving?\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): Yes. This was in early October.\n\nJUDGE: And when did you actually move out?\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): By October 27th, we found a new apartment. We were supposed to move on Monday, October 29th, but because of Hurricane Sandy, we couldn’t. The next day, we had no electricity, so we decided to take all the food and move to the new place.\n\nJUDGE: You moved during Hurricane Sandy?\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): Yes, the next day, Tuesday. It was freezing cold, and we had no electricity.\n\nJUDGE: So you’re suing for the security deposit back. What I don’t understand is why you’re also suing for the cost of a moving truck and the money you put down on another apartment. Why would he have to pay that?\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): It was just that we had to do everything ourselves.\n\nJUDGE: That’s not his responsibility. Why does he have to pay for your moving expenses?\n\nPLAINTIFF (ARIES PEÑA): We didn’t want to move—we just wanted the heat to be fixed.\n\nDEFENDANT (EDWARD GUSTER): When I spoke to the husband about moving out, it wasn’t really heating season yet. I had put in three new radiators, one in the bedroom, one in the baby’s bedroom, one in the kitchen, and one in the bathroom.\n\nJUDGE: But they still kept calling you?\n\nDEFENDANT (EDWARD GUSTER): Yes, but by the end of September, I suggested they look for another apartment if they weren’t happy.\n\nJUDGE: Did they ever call to tell you when they were moving out?\n\nDEFENDANT (EDWARD GUSTER): No, they never called me. I saw them moving on November 1st.\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): That’s incorrect. We gave him the key on the 6th.\n\nJUDGE: Why didn’t you pay for November if your stuff was still there?\n\nPLAINTIFF (WASCAR HISANO): We didn’t want to stay longer; we just needed time to move.\n\nDEFENDANT (EDWARD GUSTER): I offered them half the deposit back on November 13th, but they refused and took me to court instead.\n\nJUDGE: They left on the 6th and filed on the 9th. You rented the place on the 15th, mitigating your damages. Verdict for the plaintiff, $650.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, deflection, gaslighting, plaing the victim"}

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff was hired to help renovate the defendant’s body shop and got stiffed, but the defendant says the plaintiff was hammering him for way too much, even demanding money at a funeral. It’s the case of \"I won’t rest in peace until you pay me.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Andrew Toll & Toll Renovations, you are suing Albert Bini for $1,800 that you say he owes you for work that was done and completed but that he never paid you for. Tell me.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. I was contracted by Al to do some work at a body shop that he owned. He was going to have his nephew renovate to work in the body shop. He had me do work at my hourly rate with another employee of mine.\n\nJudge: How did he have you do the work? Did you guys have a contract?\n\nPlaintiff: Verbal contract.\n\nJudge: Okay. And verbally, what did he say he would pay you?\n\nPlaintiff: He would pay me $35 an hour, and my employee would be $20 an hour.\n\nJudge: And then what was the work he was asking you to do?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, what we did was we power washed the body shop completely. We started to paint the body shop.\n\nJudge: You started to paint. How far along did you get?\n\nPlaintiff: 90% of it.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: There was a leak in the roof under the air conditioning condenser. I fixed all of the roof except for that.\n\nJudge: When you say fixed the roof, what does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff: I put down a torch-down rubber-modified roof.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Underneath the air conditioning condenser was another source of the leak that I couldn’t fix until the air conditioning condenser was removed.\n\nJudge: Okay. So Al found someone to rent the property and canceled all the work. Did you—now tell me everything that you’d done. Anything else to tell me about?\n\nPlaintiff: No, that was it. I tore out a rug that Al said he didn’t want torn out. He had someone come in to rent the space and—\n\nJudge: You tore out a rug that he didn’t want torn out?\n\nPlaintiff: It was an old rug in the office. He thought it was a good rug. Then someone came in that was going to run the body shop for him. He wanted the rug torn out because he was going to move into that area.\n\nJudge: So, he asked for you to rip it out?\n\nPlaintiff: Al said whatever he wanted me to do, to take care of.\n\nJudge: And then later got mad that the rug got discarded?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How much did he pay you?\n\nPlaintiff: About $4,000 or so.\n\nJudge: And how did he pay that $4,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Over several checks.\n\nJudge: How many checks?\n\nPlaintiff: About five.\n\nJudge: About five. So, how is it that you would get paid? What was the custom?\n\nPlaintiff: I would submit my hours to Al, and he would pay me.\n\nJudge: And then he stopped?\n\nPlaintiff: He paid me less than I had on the estimate or for the invoice, and then finally he just stopped paying.\n\nJudge: Mr. Bini, why is it, according to him, you still owe him $1,800?\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I met Mr. Toll through my nephew. He was a personal friend of my nephew. I had a tenant move out, and all I wanted was the building painted inside and outside and some leak repairs done to the roof. I told him not to do any demolition work to the rugs in the main office because I could shampoo them and make them work for the next person to come in.\n\nJudge: Tell me what happens. Why did you stop paying him?\n\nDefendant: The work was substandard.\n\nJudge: How so?\n\nDefendant: The paint—he was billing me hourly. I didn’t know that.\n\nJudge: What did you think he was going to bill you?\n\nDefendant: The five checks I wrote him were just like that. But he never defined it. I kept asking him for an invoice.\n\nJudge: Well, then why do you keep paying him?\n\nDefendant: I stopped paying him. That’s why I stopped.\n\nJudge: No, why did you pay him five times if that didn’t work for you?\n\nDefendant: I had to get it rented. I can’t feed my family without the income.\n\nJudge: So you kept having him work for you under this manner for five full checks?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you did do business like this. Now, apparently, the last check you gave him was for how much?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, the last check that he gave me was for $1,800. In the notation section, he wrote $2,100 minus $300—$1,800 balance.\n\nJudge: Let me see that. And you cashed that check?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And that was how long ago?\n\nPlaintiff: February of last year.\n\nJudge: Okay, well, here’s my ruling. You clearly paid him five times for work he did, so you felt five times that he earned his keep. If it was good enough for you, it's good enough for me. I find that you owe him $1,800, just like you said you did, and I’m ordering you to pay the plaintiff $1,800 plus his court costs.\n\nJudge: And listen to me—try to comport yourself like a grown man as opposed to a child, okay? Pretend your daughter is watching you at every turn. She is.

And we’ll talk about why in a second and that he hasn’t paid. You are counterclaiming against her for $1,960 for insurance on the car that you didn’t get to use because it got towed and the amount of the car because I guess you lost it once it got towed. Yes?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: He called me up—well, I knew Clarence for a very long time. We lived in the same building.\n\nJudge: How long have you known him?\n\nPlaintiff: My whole life. I’ve lived in the same building for 19 years, so our families know each other. And he called me up and he said he needed a favor, but he didn’t want to ask me over the phone, so—\n\nJudge: That’s when you say, ‘No, I’m really busy.’\n\nPlaintiff: So we sat down, he said that he had gotten a car already, he paid for it, but he didn’t have the license or the right paperwork to get it registered or insured.\n\nJudge: He doesn’t have a license?\n\nPlaintiff: He didn’t have a license at the time, he was working on getting one. He just had his permit.\n\nJudge: Okay, so he asked you to what? Register the car and insure the car? Are you kidding me? A guy who doesn’t even have a license?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him I was taking a big risk doing it.\n\nJudge: What—why would you take that big risk and do that?\n\nPlaintiff: He was like family. He’s like a younger brother to me.\n\nJudge: Well, if my daughter came up to me and asked for that, I wouldn’t do it. My daughter can’t drive—she’s only got a—did you have a restricted, or you didn’t have anything?\n\nDefendant: I had a permit.\n\nJudge: A permit. So you’re supposed to drive with a licensed driver next to you?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Right. My daughter comes up to me and says, ‘Listen, this car that’s registered in your name and the insurance in your name, I’m not supposed to drive without you or a licensed driver, but I’m just going to be driving anyway, Mom, so hand me the car.’ I’m going to do that? No.\n\nJudge: That’s my daughter—she’s my flesh and blood. Why would you do that for a neighbor? I don’t care how many years you’ve known him. Why would you put your name on the lawsuit that he has when he runs over 20 orphans at a stoplight?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: That’s going to be you who’s going to be sued because the car is in your name. So what—but what I don’t understand is—\n\nPlaintiff: Well, we were all friends.\n\nJudge: Well, then that’s the time—just like he has a hard face and—what do we call it in Spanish? He’s got the nerve to come up to you and say, ‘I would like for you to put this—can you do that for me?’ You have the same nerve to say, ‘Sweetheart, I love you, I’ve known you 19 years, but I am not putting in my name a car with a man who doesn’t have a license. Go get a license.’ That’s what I would say. Is that so hard?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Alright. So how’d that work out for you, by the way?\n\nPlaintiff: Not good.\n\nJudge: Because what happened? You put the car in your name, you registered it in your name, you got insurance, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Over—well, literally overnight. It was August 12th, he got the car. August 13th, I got the insurance online. August 14th, I printed out the insurance.\n\nJudge: And when did he get his first ticket that he didn’t pay?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, that’s the other thing I forgot. If he gets tickets—parking tickets—the tickets are going to be issued to the car that is in your name. So it’ll go eventually against your license if they’re unpaid. I forgot that part.\n\nJudge: Apparently, you forgot that part. No, you knew that part, because you told him when you had the discussion, didn’t you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Didn’t you tell him, ‘If anything happens, if you get tickets, you got to pay them’?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we discussed that.\n\nJudge: You actually discussed—so you, unlike me, because I don’t really think that I’m going to get a ticket, you actually thought he might get a ticket and said, ‘If you get a ticket, it’s on you.’\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Mr. Smith, as we’ve discussed, there were multiple unpaid tickets on your vehicle. Are you disputing that these tickets were issued to your car?\n\nDefendant (Mr. Smith): No, Your Honor, but I wasn’t aware of all of them. I moved addresses, and I never received notices for some of these tickets.\n\nJudge: The records show that the city mailed multiple notices to the address registered with the DMV. Did you update your registration when you moved?\n\nDefendant: No, but I wasn’t trying to avoid anything. I just didn’t know I had to update it immediately.\n\nJudge: Unfortunately, the responsibility to keep your registration updated falls on you. The law presumes that notices sent to the last registered address are received.\n\nPlaintiff (Tow Company Representative): Your Honor, our company followed city regulations. The vehicle was flagged for immobilization due to unpaid citations, and after the defendant failed to pay within the required period, we legally towed and impounded it.\n\nDefendant: But I didn’t even know it was towed until days later! I thought it was stolen!\n\nJudge: Did you attempt to contact the parking authority after realizing your car was missing?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but by then, the fees had already gone up. It felt like they were just trying to take advantage of me.\n\nJudge: I understand your frustration, but the tow company acted within its rights. Mr. Smith, I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff. You are responsible for the towing and impound fees.\n\nDefendant: This is unfair. I want to file a counterclaim for the stress and inconvenience.\n\nJudge: I’ve reviewed your counterclaim, and I do not find sufficient legal grounds to proceed. Your claim is denied.\n\nDefendant: But—\n\nJudge: This case is closed.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Guilt-Tripping,Deflection ,Playing the Victim"}

And I said, well, family, so I lowered it to $500.\nJudge: For $500 total?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): Yes.\nJudge: And, um, so you get there, the night of the gig, and are you supposed to get paid in advance or at the end of the night? Is usually how people get paid?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): No, before that he called me and said, \"Can he get with his wife in my car?\" And he said so I told him, \"Well, you got to help me with the gasoline.\" So he said yes. That's why I put it $50.\nJudge: So when you went there, everything was fine?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): Yes.\nJudge: How far away was the gig?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): Like, like, two hours driving.\nJudge: Alright, so you get there, everything's fine, and then at the end of the night what happened?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): So I sit down waiting. I saw him and I said, \"Where's my money?\" He said, okay.\nJudge: He hadn't paid you yet?\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): No.\nPlaintiff (Felix Figueroa): So I was still sitting down.

We said, \"I'm going to give you $200, and the rest Monday.\" That was on a Saturday. So I said, \"No, I want the full amount.\" So he grabbed the $200. I said, \"I'm going to pay you the full amount Monday.\" I said, \"No way, give me the $200.\" Second thought, you know, and then, okay, he started up.

{"id": "240", "dialogue": "**Transcript of Courtroom Conversation**\n\n**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Ethel. She says the defendant, her niece, whom she let live in her house, owes her for unpaid rent. That’s right, her own family’s disrespecting her. She doesn’t have time for petty stuff like that, and the defendant needs to pay her the $3,800 she owes.\n\n**[Music]**\n\n**Judge:** This is the defendant, Karen Winston. She says she’s lived in that house rent-free since way before her aunt took control of the family finances. After all, she’s a minister, and she doesn’t come from a place of hatred and malice like her aunt does. Bottom line, she needs the judge’s help setting her aunt straight so they can all live in peace.\n\nShe’s accused of dissing an auntie.\n\n**Bailiff:** All parties, please raise your right hand. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\n\n**Plaintiff & Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you. Okay, Ethel, you’ve asked us to refer to you only by your first name. You are suing Karen Winston, your niece, for $3,800: $600 in rent for December, $600 in rent for January, and $2,600—the remaining balance of a lease that you say you have with her. Now, Karen Winston is your niece, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** She was living in your house?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Tell me about that.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, um, Karen moved there at an early age, and when she graduated from high school, she moved on. Then she came back to live in the house because—\n\n**Judge:** To live in the house with you or to live in the house with somebody else?\n\n**Plaintiff:** My mother had the apartment upstairs.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So my mother’s older now. She’s 97.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And Karen asked to come back. My mother asked me. I said, \"That’ll be good to be company for you,\" you know? And uh, wasn’t working out good.\n\n**Judge:** Well, we don’t get along?\n\n**Plaintiff:** You and Karen don’t?\n\n**Judge:** Or she and your mom don’t?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t get along with her.\n\n**Judge:** But you don’t live there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I do.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, you do live there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I do.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so how is she company for your mom if you’re already company for your mom?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because I’m downstairs. I have the basement and the parlor floor, and my mother has the upstairs apartment. She has five rooms upstairs.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So we didn’t get along. Never did. But it is what it is. I don’t let that stress me.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, but like I said, I have my evidence here where she refused to sign a lease and—\n\n**Judge:** So then how are you suing for $2,600 for the remaining of a lease that doesn’t exist?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I brought the lease to her to sign. She refused to sign.\n\n**Judge:** Then you don’t have a lease. So how are you suing for almost three grand on a lease that doesn’t exist?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, Your Honor, I didn’t understand it. I said I’d bring it to court, and this way they will straighten it out.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So tell me what happens though, because her having to pay rent was a recent development. Tell me when that became a development.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh, when I asked for $800 a month.\n\n**Judge:** When did you ask for that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was in February.\n\n**Judge:** Of what year?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Of 2012.\n\n**Judge:** February 15th?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So are you saying she started paying rent in February?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, and how much rent was she paying?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, she gave me $600. I asked for $800.\n\n**Judge:** And you decided to accept $600 a month?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I had no choice at the time.\n\n**Judge:** So then—well, you had a choice. When did it become your house? It was always your house?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It became my house in January.\n\n**Judge:** Of what year?\n\n**Plaintiff:** 2012.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, and then the next month you told Karen she had to pay rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you tell her she has to start paying rent. What does she say?\n\nPlaintiff: She agreed at first, but then she started making excuses.\n\nJudge: What kind of excuses?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she didn’t think she had to pay because my mother never charged her. But my mother wasn’t the owner anymore—I was.\n\nJudge: Karen, what’s your side of this?\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I’ve lived there for years, and there was never a formal rent agreement. My aunt took over finances and suddenly wanted money from me. I didn’t think it was fair.\n\nJudge: But did you pay any rent?\n\nDefendant: I gave her money when I could, but it wasn’t a fixed amount. I also helped around the house, did errands for my grandmother.\n\nJudge: That’s not rent. Rent is a set payment, not favors.\n\nDefendant: I understand, but I was never told officially, in writing, that I had to pay rent.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying there was no lease?\n\nDefendant: No lease, Your Honor. She brought me one to sign, but I never agreed to it.\n\nJudge: Then I don’t see how the plaintiff can sue for the full lease amount if there was no lease signed.\n\nPlaintiff: She still lived there and owed for the months she stayed.\n\nJudge: That’s different. You can sue for unpaid rent, but not for the remainder of a lease that was never agreed upon.\n\nPlaintiff: Understood.\n\nJudge: Now, did she make any payments at all for December or January?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she did not.\n\nJudge: Karen, did you make any payments?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor, because I didn’t believe I owed that amount.\n\nJudge: Whether you believed it or not, you were staying in the home, and your aunt, the legal owner, asked for rent. You don’t get to live somewhere for free just because there wasn’t a formal lease.\n\nDefendant: I understand.\n\nJudge: I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the December rent of $600. The lease claim is dismissed.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nDefendant: Thank you.\n\nBailiff: Court is adjourned.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Emotional Appeal"}

{"id": "196", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Teresa Nar. She says she's in charge of social media for a pet rescue center, and she posted some adorable Golden Retriever puppies on the website and took a deposit from the defendant for one of them. He also had first pick of the litter. The guy took the puppy home and gave it to someone else without vetting him, and she was furious. The sneak then canceled the PayPal payment, and he completely scammed her. What a player. She's suing for $815 that now she's out.\n\nThis is defendant Nicholas Caravella. He says the puppy was very sick when he got it home, pooping out worms and throwing up a lot. The vet told him the puppy wasn't healthy, so he found another home for him on his own. During all of this, someone stole his identity on PayPal, and he didn't realize the payment was reversed. Well, either way, it doesn't matter. He was sold a defective dog, and he owes this woman nothing but a curt goodbye. He's accused of being a puppy pilferer.\n\nAll parties, please be ready in court.\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff works for a pet rescue center, and the defendant put a deposit down on a Golden Retriever, took the dog, gave it away without permission, and then canceled the deposit. Now, the defendant says the pup was defective. It's the case of \"You Broke the Golden Rule, You Dog.\"\n\n**Judge:** Teresa Nar?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. You are suing Nicholas Caravella for $815 that you are out because he reversed the charges on a puppy he purchased from you. Now, Ms. Nar, how did you get a hold of those puppies? You work for an organization?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I do social media for a rescue in New Jersey, and I had an ad I was running about some Golden Retrievers that were coming in. Nicholas contacted me and asked me if there was any way he could get one of those puppies. As you can imagine, Golden Retriever puppies coming into a rescue is pretty rare, so of course, I was inundated with requests.\n\n**Judge:** And then you were inundated because everybody wants a Golden Retriever. And then, uh, so you were selling them for how much?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, it's an adoption, and the fee was $775.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And then who gets that money?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The organization.\n\n**Judge:** The organization gets the money?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. And we normally don't take deposits. That's why we don't do any type of electronic payments. We don't have a business PayPal or Venmo account. We do everything through either cash or check. So when he contacted me, I said, \"Well, we don't really have any type of electronic payment. You're more than welcome to come to my house and drop off a check for a deposit or just make an appointment, and I'll be sure that you can get a puppy.\" Well, he was nervous. He wanted to get a puppy. Apparently, this was, you know, a dog that he really wanted. So I used my own personal PayPal account, and I took the money that way, and I figured when the money came in, I would just withdraw it and give it back to the rescue.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. The day that the puppies came in, they all had a vet appointment earlier that day. He PayPaled over the balance that he was due to pay?\n\n**Plaintiff:** To me.\n\n**Judge:** But he wasn't supposed to do that, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** And I called him. I said, \"You don’t need to PayPal over anything. You come, and you pick. For all I know, you’re going to come, and you’re not going to want a puppy.\" But he PayPaled it, and at that point, I said, \"We'll worry about it when you get here.\"\n\n**Judge:** He takes the puppy, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Takes the puppy. I give him the adoption contract that he signs. There were vet records that he had to sign off on. There was a health certificate from the vet that checked the puppy that he had to sign off from. I had food for him.\n\n**Judge:** And that health certificate was dated what day?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That day.\n\n**Judge:** That day. The vet had checked it that day. Alright. So done deal. He takes the dog. And when’s the next time you hear from him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I called him the next day. He didn’t answer initially, and then he called me back and said, \"I got fired, and I can’t keep the puppy.\" And I said, \"Okay.\"\n\n**Judge:** What happened here, Mr. Caravella?\n\n**Defendant:** When I saw the puppy on Craigslist, I really wanted a Golden Retriever. I messaged her, everything was good. I brought the puppy home. The puppy started pooping out worms and had bloody stool, unfortunately. The next day, I took the puppy to the vet, and the vet actually said that the puppy wasn’t healthy and I wouldn’t be able to keep it around my other dogs.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Prove that.\n\n**Defendant:** I actually have a picture.\n\n**Judge:** Hand it to my bailiff.\n\n**Judge:** What is this a picture of?\n\n**Defendant:** That was a picture of my couch. The puppy actually had it in my arms and started pooping up blood.\n\n**Judge:** But what is it a picture of?\n\n**Defendant:** The armrest. And the blood was actually, I was trying to get the blood out of the couch.\n\n**Judge:** I wanted the vet declaration that the puppy was unfit for sale. That’s what I asked for.\n\n**Defendant:** That, Your Honor, I don’t have.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, that’s unfortunate. Because that’s the actual proof rather than your flapping gums. Yes, ma’am. Because anyone can say that.\n\n**Judge:** And it isn’t until three months later that someone has the bright idea to turn around and reverse the charges. Tell me about that.\n\n**Defendant:** I was part of identity theft, and PayPal actually took all my accounts.\n\n**Judge:** Why did you tell PayPal that it was fraudulent when you knew it wasn’t?\n\n**Defendant:** Because when I contacted her about returning the puppy, she said, \"I'm sorry, all sales are final.\"\n\n**Judge:** You lied to PayPal. You stole the money from her account by lying to PayPal. Are you nuts?\n\n**Judge:** You have to pay for the dog because you took it.

{"id": "312", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Christopher Russo. He says that the defendant is one of those double-talking landlords who promised that an apartment he rented from him was going to be ready, and it wasn’t. They had a firm move-in date, but he postponed it a few times, which was a huge and costly inconvenience. And when he did finally move in, there was no doorknob or lock on the front door, and the oven didn’t work. He demanded a refund from the defendant. The louse refuses, and he's here suing for the $700 he's still owed.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Frank. He says he disagrees with the plaintiff because the apartment was in move-in condition. The plaintiff simply changed his mind on a whim, and he can’t believe he wasted his time fixing up the place for the plaintiff because he double-crossed him. He’s accused of not being ready.\n\nBailiff: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case in the docket: The plaintiff rented from the defendant, but when it came time for the move-in date, it came and went. And when he finally moved in, it didn’t even have a doorknob. But the defendant says the plaintiff just had buyer’s remorse. It’s the case of Show Them the Door but Not the Knob.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Christopher Russo, you are suing Frank, your almost-landlord, for $700 remaining of a deposit that you had given him. And according to you, the place wasn’t ready. Talk to me.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. So, in mid-September, I had to find a new apartment because the place I was renting from was being sold. I wasn’t having much luck, but I did find Frank’s place on Craigslist. He was running what he was calling a \"renovation special,\" which basically meant that he was admitting the place still needed a lot of work, still had renovations to be done, but he was looking for someone to sign a lease to move in as soon as possible after those renovations were complete.\n\nJudge: But to sign now in the hope that the renovations were done. That’s what it sounds like to me. Did you guys have a lease or no?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I had given him the $3,200, which includes the month-and-a-half security deposit plus the first month’s rent for the lease that was supposed to start on October 15th.\n\nJudge: And when did you give that to him?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him the security deposit on September 29th. I gave him the first month’s rent on October 10th when I assumed I was moving in on the 15th as per the terms of the lease and the security deposit.\n\nPlaintiff: On September 29th, my friend Pete and I went to sign the security deposit, and the apartment was still a complete wreck. There was dust and dirt everywhere. But we figured he still had two-plus weeks, and he did have someone helping him, so at that point, I wasn’t worried yet.\n\nJudge: Was he actually doing the work himself?\n\nPlaintiff: Him and someone else, I believe.\n\nPlaintiff: The security deposit, which I signed on that date and I gave him the $1,920, the first thing it says is: If the unit is not available at the agreed-upon date, the landlord will make a full refund of the deposit without interest and with no liability or penalty to either party.\n\nJudge: And that’s in the contract that you had signed?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s in the security deposit contract.\n\nJudge: Can I see the security deposit contract?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, this is not the lease. This was the security deposit agreement.\n\nJudge: (Reading contract) Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: On October 10th, I signed the lease. He had $3,200 of mine. It was agreed that I would pick up the keys on the 16th, even though the lease started the 15th. He said he was busy that day, so already pushing back one day. But that was fine at that time.\n\nPlaintiff: So, needless to say, my brother scheduled the day off work for that Wednesday. I had a truck ready to go. And I thought, on the 14th, the day before the lease was to start, I better just write him a quick email making sure everything's good. I do have all the email correspondence—it’s several pages. But he just said that the place was not going to be ready until the 19th, the Friday.\n\nJudge: Friday the 19th, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: So on the 18th, the day before the Friday that I’m supposed to get my keys, he writes me saying, \"The good news is the place will definitely, absolutely be ready by October 20th,\" which is Saturday.\n\nJudge (to Defendant): What’s going on here? Why isn’t the place ready when he is supposed to be moving in?\n\nDefendant: I’m a perfectionist. I was trying to make this place perfect, and I just kept finding things to do, unfortunately. And that’s really all it is.\n\nJudge: I know, but you have a deadline for your completion of your work. Why did you miss the deadline?\n\nDefendant: I underestimated how long it was going to take.\n\nJudge: That’s a better answer. That’s the truthful answer. It’s not that you’re a perfectionist—it’s that you didn’t do what you said you were going to do.\n\nJudge: Now, he didn’t have a problem with it on the 15th. He didn’t have a problem with it on the 16th. He didn’t have a problem with it on the 19th. When you moved it now to the 20th, what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: So, on the 20th, we show up, and I actually have this whole thing on recording as well, and a witness.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you actually go in there on the 20th with this witness?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you actually tape him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You don’t tell him you’re taping him?\n\nPlaintiff: I did at the very end.\n\nJudge: That’s after you taped him. That’s not what I’m asking. But that’s legal in New Jersey. In my state, Florida, it’s a third-degree felony if you do that.\n\nJudge: Let’s play the recording.\n\n(Recording plays)\n\nJudge: There was no doorknob to his apartment?\n\nDefendant: The door was brand new. The person who was supposed to do it had an issue, and then it wasn’t done in time.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t the stove work?\n\nDefendant: The outlet that the stove plugs into was inoperational that day.\n\nJudge: At what point are you just so untrustworthy and unreliable that people don’t have to go into business with you?\n\nJudge: Can you explain why, when you returned his money, you kept $700?\n\nDefendant: The unit was fine.\n\nJudge: No, it wasn’t.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff, $700.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "framing the narrative, character attack, gaslighting, minimization"}

That happened February 24 at night. I was walking up the same way when I drive in, my son, my first son, he was away from me by 10 feet, and I was walking with my second son. My first son had his puppy. He was, how old is your first son?\n\nJudge: 10 years old. How does he have your puppy?

My second son spoke to me in that moment, and I looked at my son, and that was the last time I saw Coco on the floor. My son screamed and ran to me. Then I see her dog.\n\nJudge: What kind of dog do you have?\n\nPlaintiff: It's a Pitbull.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: My Pitbull grabbed my Coco. I tried to kick the dog, but then he let go of the puppy. The first time I saw Coco, I knew he was already in bad condition.\n\nJudge: The dog was alive though when you took the dog to the vet?\n\nPlaintiff: No, in that moment, we didn’t have the key to go back to the garage. Some neighbors heard my son screaming because he was begging for help. My little son came to me, and he said, \"Oh, the dog killed him,\" and I thought it was my son. Then I saw my dog, and he looked at me and passed away. So, we thought we could do something, so we took the dog with a neighbor’s car to the hospital. When we got there, I gave the dog to the doctor, and he said, \"I’m sorry.\" I saw my clothes with blood and everything. It’s very sad because it’s not only the first time this happened. The same dog attacked another dog, and I have proof. Yes, I have the pictures. When I went to make the report to the police, the police were very sad for me, but unfortunately, when a dog is killed by another dog, you can’t do anything.\n\nJudge: Well, that’s not true. You’re doing something, but go ahead. I want to see the pictures. Do you have a statement from that person?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have it.\n\nJudge: Okay, let me see that.\n\nDefendant: Okay, I was walking my dog, and there was something that I thought at first was a cat, you know, because there wasn’t anyone on the street. The dog was by itself. Then I realized that it wasn’t a cat, that it was actually a dog. You say the dog was by itself. Was the dog on a leash?\n\nDefendant: Absolutely not. The dog wasn’t on a leash, and neither were the two boys. There was one boy.\n\nJudge: Okay, I have an affidavit for a witness that was directly across the street.\n\nDefendant: No, no, she’s keeping me company. She’s my sister.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nDefendant: The dog was by itself when it started running at me. May I step out?\n\nJudge: Yeah, okay.\n\nDefendant: The dog just came running at me. So, I screamed. No, okay, the dog kept coming, and by that time, he was right at me. I stuck my foot up, and it hit the bottom of my foot. It ricocheted off, crashing into my shin. I had a bruise for at least two weeks on my leg. The dog bounced back, leaped on my dog’s face, and bit him.\n\nJudge: Okay, I have pictures of his face.\n\nDefendant (showing pictures): Let me see. I immediately stuck my hand in the choker, and I told him, \"No, no.\" It’s a baby now. I know he knows the word “baby,” so he immediately put the dog down on the ground.\n\nDefendant: Then simultaneously, I look and there’s a man kneeling in front of me, and I hear the voice of a boy next to me. The man went down, took the dog up, and was doing this to the top of the head. I said to him, \"Is he okay?\" He said, \"He’s fine, he’s fine.\"\n\nJudge: Okay, so you went across the street and called again.\n\nDefendant: Yes, I asked, \"Are you sure? Is he okay?\" He said, \"He’s fine, he’s fine.\"\n\nJudge: The attack killed the dog. Why would an owner of a dog say everything’s fine?\n\nDefendant: He wasn’t saying, \"Everything’s fine.\" He said, \"He’s fine.\" Did you think he was fine?\n\nJudge: I know, but it had to be a pretty serious attack. Was there blood?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t see any blood, no.\n\nJudge: Was there blood on the spot?\n\nDefendant: Yes, of course.\n\nJudge: According to you, he goes, “Yeah, everything’s fine,” and then the dog dies.\n\nDefendant: He didn’t say like that. He said, “He’s fine.”\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nDefendant: I walked across the street to where the witness was standing. He said to me, “Was that you that was screaming?” I said to him, “Yeah, there was a dog across the street with no leash.” I was screaming at the dog to stop. The witness said, “I heard the commotion and saw a man with a tan and white dog crossing the sidewalk. The dog was wearing a double collar and was on a leash.”\n\nJudge: What’s this person’s name?\n\nDefendant: I can’t even read the signature. Well, it’s Joe Mango. Do you know that person?\n\nJudge (reading the statement): “I saw and heard a dog running from the underground garage up the driveway.

She was recounting an incident with another dog across the street moments before. She told me her dog was just attacked by another unleashed dog.”\n\nJudge (pondering): What do I have here? I have the plaintiff, who has the burden of proof in my courtroom of proving that things happened the way she says. And I have some question whether things happened the way she says. And unless you're able to persuade me by a preponderance of the evidence that they happened your way, my verdict has to be for the defendant.\n\nJudge (after considering): And it is.

{"id": "773", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Shawn Dale Tatum. She says she was involved in a hit-and-run accident and her 2004 Kia Sedona was badly damaged. The defendant promised to repair her car, made her pay for everything up front, and then the rat took off with her money. Now she has a smashed car, no money, and is suing the defendant for the $800 she gave him.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Angel Suarez. He says the plaintiff, his sister-in-law, canceled the order for the repair work to be done after he'd already ordered the parts. The woman’s trying to play games with him, and he's not going to get stuck with the parts the mechanic already ordered. This whole thing’s one big mess now because he's not talking to his brother. He's accused of not fixing it.\n\n[Music]\n\nJudge: Good. All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff was involved in a hit and run. The defendant promised to fix it but didn't. The defendant says the plaintiff, who is his sister-in-law, did some funny business with the parts. It's the case of \"I Hit That.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Shawn Dale Tatum, you are suing Angel Suarez for $800 that you say he owes you in parts that you'd ordered with him, but he never fixed your car. According to you, she tried to change her mind on the deal, and the parts have already been purchased. Let me hear from you first.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, um, my car was in an accident. I was hit on my front passenger side.\n\nJudge: Okay, and he fixed the car?\n\nPlaintiff: He came over—\n\nJudge: How do you know him?\n\nPlaintiff: He's my husband's brother.\n\nJudge: He's your husband's brother? Why were you calling him a friend in the—\n\nPlaintiff: Well, because he's my husband's friend, but they've known each other for a while, so they consider each other family.\n\nJudge: Okay. Are you brothers or are you not brothers?\n\nDefendant: They're not related. They're not actually brothers, just friends.\n\nJudge: You grew up together?\n\nDefendant: We said that we were brothers.\n\nJudge: In the same household?\n\nDefendant: No, in the same neighborhood.\n\nJudge: How big a neighborhood is this?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so it’s a close friend of his.\n\nJudge: And then what? You—you know him?\n\nPlaintiff: I met him through my husband, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and now your husband ended up in jail?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What is he in jail for?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, drugs.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, was he in jail at the time that you hired him to fix the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he was out.\n\nJudge: Who does the hiring—him or you?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, I spoke with Angel, and we agreed that he would fix my car for me.\n\nJudge: All right. Do you give him any money?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, at that time, no. He just came over, he looked at the car, he told me what we were going to need to purchase for the car.\n\nJudge: Now, are you a repairman? Are you a bodyman? What are you?\n\nDefendant: No, a friend of mine owns a mechanic shop and a body shop. So she asked me to come and check out the car. I said, all right, no problem.\n\nJudge: Why? Just because you know a guy who knows what he's doing?\n\nDefendant: I—I—I do mechanic work.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: But a friend of mine owns a body shop right next door to the shop that we had.\n\nJudge: Were you going to do the mechanic work and he was going to do the body work?\n\nDefendant: Yes, correct.\n\nJudge: And do you have a job, or you don't?\n\nDefendant: No, I do. I help my stepfather at the shop at the mechanic—\n\nJudge: Is this the shop we're talking about?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: That was—oh, that’s your—a friend of mine or your stepfather?\n\nDefendant: No, my step—no, no, no. The body shop is a friend. The mechanic shop is my stepfather's.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you tell her, \"I can help you out and get you a good price.\"\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you folks agree on what?\n\nDefendant: I told her parts were going to run her $800.\n\nJudge: How much did she pay you for parts?\n\nDefendant: She gave me—first, she gave me $450. She, I think, Western Union money-granted it to me, and then she gave me another amount of $280.\n\nJudge: Does that sound right?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: How much do you say you gave?\n\nPlaintiff: I wired $450, right? And then $300 on another day.\n\nJudge: Okay. Does that sound familiar?\n\nDefendant: No. She—totally, she gave me $280.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, do you have a receipt?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, that's where we are on that one—without a receipt. All right, now let’s move on from that fact and let’s talk about what actually happens. This is the end of February. You take the car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So, you're waiting for the parts to come?\n\nDefendant: No, the parts were already there. Then she calls me. Before she gave me the money, I ordered the parts for her. She tells me she didn’t want to do it.\n\nJudge: How long after telling you did she say that?\n\nDefendant: I ordered the parts that same day. Me and her discussed it, I ordered the parts. She comes and tells me that she doesn't want to do the car the following day.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, it's back and forth—\"I want the car fixed, I don’t want the car fixed.\" We already had the parts in the shop. So, I tell the guy, \"Listen, she wants the money back.\" But he goes, \"You guys are playing games going back and forth with these parts. I can't get my money back.\"\n\nJudge: Okay. Now, I need you to prove exactly what you just said. Do you have the guy here to testify?\n\nDefendant: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipts to prove that you bought parts?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Now, why do you get to change your mind? The rest of us can't. [Continues with legal discussion and ruling.]\n\nJudge: I am awarding the plaintiff $730 plus court costs.

I was on my way to work at my overtime site, and I was coming down the FDI Drive. After I got off the entrance lane, I was in the right lane, and an ambulance was coming. As I tried to get off the lane onto Hon Street to make the right turn because I was already in the right lane, all of a sudden, I hear a noise in the back of my car. I look to the side, and I see this young man pull up on the side of me. And I'm looking at him and saying, \"Why didn't you wait until I turned the corner?\" That was my remark to him, and that’s the truth.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. \"Why didn’t you wait until I turned the corner?\" Let’s do something. Come on up to the drawing that we have here. Now pick any car you want to be.\n\n**Plaintiff:** (Picks a car)\n\n**Judge:** There you go. Now, you say that you were in the—oh, no, no. Right. I’m going to—here’s the exit.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, I'm sorry.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, no problem. All right. So you are there, right? All right. And then pick a car to be him.\n\n**Plaintiff:** (Picks another car)\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And what is it you are saying happens? I want you to show me what you say happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, it’s one more car involved.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because the other car got hit in the right light. After that car got hit—\n\n**Judge:** So first this car gets hit, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** And then what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Then he runs into the side of me.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, that’s what you’re describing?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Where was he trying to go? Do you think he was trying to cut past you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He thought he could make it between the two cars. I believe he lost control. When I realized—I didn’t know what happened initially.\n\n**Judge:** Well, what makes you—\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, clearly, he lost control. There’s a car accident.\n\n**Judge:** I mean, what made you think he came from behind you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, and now my understanding is that there was an ambulance, and there was everybody trying to get out of the way, right?\n\n**Judge:** Right. Well—\n\n**Plaintiff:** And we weren’t moving that fast. I mean, we pulled over and had to get off the lane.\n\n**Judge:** Right. And then everybody pulls over on Houston, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** All right. That’s what I meant. So when the police come, is everybody pulled over or no? On Houston waiting for the police or no?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, he was already there. I was the first one to him. I have a picture in my phone showing—\n\n**Judge:** Sorry, the police was already in the area?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, he was right over here when I turned the corner, and I told him what happened.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go ahead and go back to the podium.\n\nAll right, Mr. Bucknall, what happened that day?\n\n**Defendant:** Hi. So essentially, um, my friend and I, Darice Wright, we were heading back into—originally, we were heading back to go towards Brooklyn. I was in the right lane. I was closer to the edge of the middle line in two-lane traffic.\n\n**Judge:** Why don’t you come up here and show me?\n\n(Defendant approaches the diagram)\n\n**Judge:** Now, just to recap, so that—I don’t want you switching cars on me. I know there’s an ambulance somewhere. All right. This is going to be the third car. This is going to be you, and this is going to be him. Tell me where everybody is. I want you to be able to put it where you want. I don’t want to put it anywhere in your story.\n\n**Defendant:** (Positions cars) So this is the third car, as I said. I’m here, and as I said, I’m closer to the line, so there’s a little space in between the curb and right here. And Mr. Ronald is right here behind me.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** There’s an ambulance coming up. The light just turns green as I’m moving forward, and he’s moving forward. Mr. Ronald, in his effort to try and escape the ambulance, is moving up. As he’s moving up, he pushes me into this vehicle right here.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So, according to your testimony, he’s looking forward, he’s driving, and he literally—and people are going like 10 miles an hour at this point. They’re not going fast.\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And he tries to wedge himself in between?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** All right. Go ahead and go back to the podium.\n\n(Continued questioning and discussion on evidence and witness testimony.)\n\n**Judge:** Based on the fact that I have absolutely no idea which version of events is accurate, and it's your job to prove to me which of you had the right of way, I cannot rule in your favor.

{"id": "909", "dialogue": "Judge:\nMuhammad, you are suing Rose. You’ve asked to be referred to only by your first names for $500, a deposit that you put down at Rose’s, is it a restaurant venue? That she refuses to return. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nOkay, so on September 29th, we first met Rose at her hall and we spoke to her about a party, an engagement party, on October 20th. And right off the bat, we tried to let her know that no matter what, we need it on the 20th, and she was adamant on saying that things are done her way and that she’s going to figure it out, and it’s up to her. So we came back. I came back, my fiancé was working on October 2nd, and me and Rose had a brief conversation about what was going to happen.\n\nJudge:\nWhy’d you come back if she was such a jerk?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nBecause, at the end of the day, it was a really nice room and that’s the room that we wanted.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was she being a jerk about?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nShe just isn’t, she was overall just trying to do things her way.\n\nJudge:\nMeaning what?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nShe was saying that if we can’t do the party on the 20th, then we can’t do it.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you wanted to do it when?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nOn the 20th.\n\nJudge:\nWait, I’m not understanding. So she was agreeing to do the party on the 20th, in a different room, not in the room that we wanted?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so why don’t you just do like anybody else, pick up your marbles and go home and pick another venue?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nBecause we like the room.\n\nJudge:\nSo you were willing to do what?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nWhen you like the room and it’s not available, what is your next game plan?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nShe had told us that if somebody canceled, that she would work around that, or she would try and work around the dates and move them to another date.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would anybody with a deposit put on a place want to move their date? They already have the place.\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nMaybe on a different room, in a different room at the same venue.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would they want a different room?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nThey had already rented that room.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so she says she’ll work on it. You leave, and then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nI come back without my fiancé. We have a brief discussion. Some bad things happen when you’re without your fiancé.\n\nJudge:\nI agree.\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nWhat did you do?\n\nJudge:\nYou put a deposit down for what date?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nSo, there was no date. There was no date agreed upon. So, you put a deposit down for no date?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nSo she said that, um, I what we spoke when she was telling me to come in was to get the money. She just needed a deposit.\n\nJudge:\nYou can’t give money if you don’t have your venue and a date. I don’t know what you’re talking about.\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nThat’s the whole point.\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nSo, you gave someone money to hold a venue without a date?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nWithout an established date, until she could figure out what she could move around?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you just wait until she figured out what she would move around?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nBecause it was within two weeks. This was October 20th.\n\nJudge:\nBut why would you give any money if you don’t have a date?\n\nPlaintiff (Muhammad):\nJust to show her that I was serious about it.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, we have a very different version of what occurred, unfortunately.\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nYes, everything that was said from the plaintiff was not true. I have a contract for Sunday, October 21st. I have text messages from his fiancé for Sunday, October 21st.\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nA week after they gave me the deposit on the 21st, they texted and said, \"Hey, listen, my sister can’t get an airline ticket for the 21st. She needs to go home to Georgia and she has to work on Monday.\" I said, \"What does that have to do with it?\"\n\nJudge:\nSo they changed their mind about the 21st.\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nBut according to you, they had rented the room they wanted, but on the 21st?\n\nJudge:\nAlright, now you said you have a contract. Show me your contract.\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nYes.\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nI’m sorry, where’s your signature?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nAfter the text message that was sent saying they wanted the 21st, I was in my office and I had clients. I was booking another event.\n\nJudge:\nDid he walk in and give you $500?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you took his $500 but did not have him sign a document?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would you not have him sign a contract with the dates, especially when the dates were an issue?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nThe date was an issue, it was in my book, and I have text messages.\n\nJudge:\nWell, then I guess it’s all settled, right? We don’t need the reason you’re right. I did not have to show me the text messages. Do you have them in your phone?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nI have them in my phone.\n\nJudge:\nGo ahead and turn on your phone. I know you turned it off to come into court, but I’d like to see them in the phone so I don’t just see the ones that a litigant wanted to show me.\n\nJudge:\nWhat am I going to see in those text messages? Am I going to see you and your girlfriend deciding on the 21st, then your sister can’t change her flight, then you guys decide to not have the party on the 21st, and now you want your money back?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nNot at all.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, starts from here and goes all the way.\n\nJudge:\nOn October 2nd, you let them know, \"Hey, I have October 28th now,\" which I presume was a Saturday. She says, \"Is the 21st no longer available in the Rosetta room?\" And you say, \"I don’t know what you say because I don’t see an answer, so I presume I don’t know whether that was by phone or what.\"\n\nJudge:\nAnd then she says, \"Hey, Muhammad is going to be there at 11:45.\" Okay, do you, is there anything you can do for us for 10/20 for us, preferably something small like the Rosetta room?\n\nDefendant (Rose):\nYou answer, \"Hello, I just want to let you know in the Rosetta room on the 20th, I am completely sold out.\" It’s like the first time you guys even talk about the 20th is in this text. Did they talk about the 20th in your office?\n\nJudge:\nBecause it’s like the first time your girlfriend’s talking about it here. So, even though I’m giving her grief that she doesn’t have a signed contract, which is what you should have, verbal contracts are enforceable. What am I to glean from these texts from your girlfriend who says specifically, \"Wait, the 21st isn’t available because that’s the date you guys wanted.\" I can tell from that, and when she says, \"Hey, we’re thinking about the 20th now,\" what am I to glean, but that you changed your mind?\n\nJudge:\nThe default position on any deposit is non-refundable. That’s the default position because the whole point of a deposit is to hold the place and not let anybody else get it. So that’s the purpose of a deposit.\n\nJudge:\nI understand that you didn’t sign anything, but between the default position of any deposit being non-refundable unless they say otherwise, and the second thing, which is from the text, I clearly see you booked the 21st and then changed your mind because of your sister’s flight.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I’m sorry that you’re in this position.

{"id": "444", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please. Welcome back to the People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The Plaintiff gave the Defendant 200 bucks for a pool table, but his guys couldn’t move it, and he wants his money back. The Defendant says that’s what happens when you try to move a heavy object with 70-year-olds. It’s the case of \"That’s My Cue to Sue.\" Thank you, Douglas. Terry Richardson, you are suing Trisha—you’ve asked us to just refer to you by your first name—for 200 dollars that you put as a deposit on a pool table, and you want it back. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: On March 3rd, 2017, I inquired on the marketplace on Facebook about pool tables.\n\nJudge: You were selling a pool table? Why?\n\nDefendant: We had damage to our house from the hurricane, and we needed our floors repaired.\n\nJudge: Which hurricane?\n\nDefendant: Matthew.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you needed your floors repaired, so you needed to get rid of the pool table. So you followed up on it?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I saw an ad, we contacted each other through Facebook, and she gave me the price—400 dollars.\n\nDefendant: I originally had it listed for 500, but we needed it gone fast.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, there are two listings on the web. The price is great, but go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: We contacted each other, she gave me the address, and I visited her house. This was my first time ever purchasing a pool table, so I said, \"Alright, I might have to get some guys.\"\n\nJudge: Happens every day, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. So I go over to take a look at it, and I like it.\n\nJudge: You offer her 400 dollars, she agrees, and you give her 200 as a deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: Right, to come back and get the pool table because I was going to take it apart, remove the legs to carry it out. I had a cousin with a pickup truck. I was going to put it on the pickup truck, but I saw that it was a little heavy—he was 60, 62. So I said, \"Well, I need another person to lift the pool table.\"\n\nJudge: When were you supposed to come back and get the pool table out of there?\n\nPlaintiff: I was trying to get it that day, which was a Friday.\n\nJudge: And so you say, \"Well, I’m gonna have to line up a couple of more people.\" Not a 62-year-old, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: To move the pool table?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Big, burly guys like you. That’s what you need. Guys from the gym. And then what happens? How long do you take to do that?\n\nPlaintiff: I called a friend the same day. He came by within a couple of hours.\n\nJudge: Oh, so that guy comes right away. But you still had just one—you and another guy?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but the pool table was extremely heavy. This time, we were like, \"This pool table is pretty heavy.\" So I went to an expert that same day—a pool expert—and he told me these pool tables carry slates that can weigh up to 150 to 200 pounds. Based on the type of pool table she had, she had over four steel slates, which made it extremely heavy.\n\nJudge: The pool expert says that? Based on what?\n\nPlaintiff: He didn’t see the pool table, but aside from that, I didn’t realize how heavy it was.\n\nJudge: Did you try lifting it when you first saw it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and I was able to lift it up.\n\nJudge: So you knew how heavy it was?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to a professional because I couldn’t lift it with just one other person.\n\nJudge: Did the professional say to you, \"Take it apart\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He said the only way to move it is if I hire an expert.\n\nJudge: And how much did he want to charge?\n\nPlaintiff: Four to five hundred dollars.\n\nJudge: And that’s when you decided you didn’t want it anymore?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So when did you tell her you wanted your money back?\n\nDefendant: Four or five days later.\n\nJudge: Did you put it back on the market?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but we needed it gone right away. He took too long, and we had to get our floors redone.\n\nJudge: What did you end up doing with the pool table?\n\nDefendant: A friend took it. We had to give it away.\n\nJudge: Did the guy who took it have trouble moving it?\n\nDefendant: No, he and two little guys just flipped it up on its side and wheeled it out the door.\n\nJudge: Did they use a dolly?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, does the guy who put the 200 down get his money back?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant: Because it was a deposit, and deposits are non-refundable.\n\nJudge: She’s right. Your lack of planning is not her emergency. Verdict for the Defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: She lied about the four days. It was the next day.\n\nJudge: That’s irrelevant. The point of a deposit is to take something off the market. She lost money, and she could have counterclaimed against you. Consider yourself lucky.

I told my wife to get a few twenties off the tree.\n\nJudge: Had he seen the tree before?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What did your wife say when this was happening?\n\nPlaintiff: When Sean said he needed to borrow money, he promised to pay it back the next morning when his mother got off the boat from The Vineyard.\n\nJudge: Did you get paid back the next morning?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Has it been paid back at all?\n\nPlaintiff: No. It’s been a year and a half now.\n\nJudge: Are you kidding me?\n\nPlaintiff: No. And every time I see him, he says \"tomorrow, tomorrow.\" It’s like being in the musical Annie.\n\nJudge: So, Sean, why haven’t you paid him back?\n\nDefendant: I was unemployed.\n\nJudge: For a year and a half?\n\nDefendant: I did get a job, but I didn’t pay him.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. I see my mother sitting on the other side, so I pretty much know I lost this case.\n\nJudge: Why is your mother sitting on his side?\n\nDefendant: Judge, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nJudge: Has your mother told you to pay him back?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She’s been telling me that for a year and a half.\n\nJudge: (to the mother) Why are you sitting on his side?\n\nDefendant’s Mother: Because he should have paid him.\n\nJudge: And you never told your son he had to pay him back?\n\nDefendant’s Mother: I told him multiple times. And Sean told Brian that I would pay him, but I didn’t even know about it.\n\nJudge: So Sean, you lied about your mother paying him?\n\nDefendant: I never said that. I just told him I’d pay him when I could.\n\nJudge: Did you work in the last year and a half?\n\nDefendant: I started working three and a half months ago.\n\nJudge: So, you could have paid him?\n\nDefendant: I guess.\n\nJudge: You guess?\n\nDefendant: I just can’t believe he took me to court over $60.\n\nJudge: I can’t believe you didn’t just pay him back and avoid coming here. Your mother even told you to pay him. Verdict for the plaintiff. Pay the $60.\n\nDefendant: Fine.\n\nJudge: Case dismissed.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim,Deflection"}

You hired him to do some work on your roof, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And why? What was it that had happened?\n\nPlaintiff: There was a fire inside the attic.\n\nJudge: Okay. How did the fire start?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, the solar panels caught on fire.\n\nJudge: Oh gosh. How did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff: The electricity arced.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so you hire him. How do you find him?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I think I might have got him off Indeed or on the internet.\n\nJudge: Okay. Alright. So he comes over. He gives you an estimate. I presume you got estimates from other people?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, no. Actually, he’s the first one I hired.\n\nJudge: How do you know he gave you a fair price?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, he said he said, uh, $12,000 to do the job.\n\nJudge: Right. I know. How do you know $12,000 was a fair price if you don’t get any more estimates? I’m talking to you like you’re my husband, because this is my husband’s theory too.\n\nPlaintiff: No, he seems— I’d like to have him do it.\n\nJudge: How do you know he’s giving you a fair price if you don’t get two other estimates? I’m just curious.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know. I don’t exactly.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: All I went on is the price of what my father paid for his roof.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Which was $10,000.\n\nJudge: Alright, so you had some guidance.\n\nPlaintiff: I had some guidance.\n\nJudge: So he comes— do you have a contract that you signed with him?\n\nPlaintiff: I do.\n\nJudge: Let me see the contract.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over contract.)\n\nJudge: That’s the contract for $12,000. And what were you getting for the $12,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I told him I wanted all the burnt lumber removed. It needed shingles. And when I got home from work, uh, I had to put a stop to the work because he didn’t remove the burnt timbers.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let’s see what it says:\n\n(Reading contract aloud)\n\nJudge: \"Remove and replace rotted or damaged wood prior to installation of new roof. Install 2x6 wood at rafters and underlayer. Install sistered in wood as needed.\"\n\nJudge: Alright. Tell me, what is sistered wood?\n\nDefendant: Sistered in means—\n\nJudge: What does sistered in mean?\n\nDefendant: You take a 2x6, and if one of the rafters is weak or cracked or not structurally sound, you put a new piece right up against it, and you nail it into the rafter to give it the support that you’re worried the thing has lost.\n\nJudge: Yes, exactly. Okay. But what did you mean when you said, \"remove and replace rotted or damaged wood\"?\n\nDefendant: The wood that would have been— when we stripped the roof, the wood that would have been on top. Some of it could have been rotted or damaged. We hadn’t gotten to that point yet.\n\nJudge: Except that he had damaged wood from a fire, and that’s what he told you.\n\nDefendant: Not really that damaged.\n\nJudge: Almost what you think. In all, sistered in just as needed?\n\nDefendant: I wasn’t really sure.\n\nJudge: And according to you, when you say \"replace rotted or damaged wood prior to putting in a new roof,\" you just mean some of the wood, not others of the wood?\n\nDefendant: Not exactly.\n\nJudge: Who are you to say what wood that was? That is legitimately interpreted to mean— you were looking at me saying, \"Well, that’s not the wood I meant, I meant the wood underneath,\" but we didn’t get to that. You know, he’s looking at burnt wood, which is what his concern is.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of the wood we’re talking about?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\n(Plaintiff approaches the judge with photos.)\n\nJudge: This one’s got the beam that was— now, you’re going to have to come over here. No, no, come over, come over. I’m going to need you to stand right here.\n\nPlaintiff: Alright.\n\nJudge: This is the main beam that goes from one end of the house to the other?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: And you can see how it was scraped?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh-huh.\n\nJudge: The integrity of the beam is compromised.\n\nJudge: Who are you to say that though? Did you have— is there somebody else who said that? Do you have an opinion from a professional that says this can’t stay that way, that the integrity of the beam is compromised? Or are you just asking me to deduce that from how it looks? Because you and I might both look at it and feel that way.\n\nJudge: What is it you’re doing? Do you have evidence from a professional that says the integrity of the wood was compromised?\n\nPlaintiff: The house smelled like burnt wood.\n\nJudge: And how am I supposed to sell a house like that?\n\nJudge: That doesn’t answer what I’m asking though.\n\n\nJudge: Did you hire somebody else to do the job?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: And you paid that person $17,000, but you had them rip everything out and start over?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Now, did that person ever put in writing that anything the defendant did had to be ripped out, as opposed to that you wanted it ripped out?\n\nPlaintiff: Not that I can remember.\n\nJudge: Do you have anybody who can say that what he did was structurally unsound?\n\nPlaintiff: Probably the building inspector or the guy who did the work.\n\nJudge: Call your next witness right now.\n\nPlaintiff: …\n\nJudge: You see what I’m saying? This is your trial. You need to bring evidence to prove your case. I’m asking you six times— did the new guy say that what the first guy did was structurally unsound?

{"id": "313", "dialogue": "Judge:\nThank you, Douglas. Okay, Angelo Carion, you are suing Axel Rodriguez, doing business as the Auto Doctor, for $3,455. What you say is the Blue Book value of a 1998 GMC truck. You have a counterclaim against them for $2,315 impound fees that you paid on his behalf that you want reimbursed and storage fees from the time of your dispute until today. Tell me what is going on, gentlemen.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nOkay, how about we try this in English now? Let's try it in English. Thank you for accepting my case. Okay, I took my truck to Mr. X ride for clutch repair. He completed the clutch repair, and when I took the truck out, there was a rattling noise inside where he fixed the clutch. It sounded almost as if there was a nut or a washer in there. I took it back to him to fix. That's when the whole issue started, where on December 12th, like the truck... What day did you take it back to him?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nI want to say the 8th of December.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and do you agree with that, that it's the 8th of December when he brings it back to you, he has it towed there?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nYes, he has it towed there.\n\nJudge:\nNow, the 8th of December, when he has it towed there, why is it being towed there?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nHe's bringing it for me to sell. He’s not bringing it for you to repair.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nNo, he says that the transmission went on it. He wants to sell the vehicle, and I told him I can't sell the vehicle without a title.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nIs that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nI thought about selling it, but I never agreed to sell it. I never agreed to sell.\n\nJudge:\nWhat is the truck there for, to be sold or to fix?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nTo fix.\n\nJudge:\nTo fix, okay. What is the quote he gave you to fix it?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nLet me see the paperwork.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nHe didn’t give me a quote. He said it was there for me to sell.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nYes, not to fix.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nNo, if you see...\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nHow much did he agree for you to sell it for?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nHe wanted to try to get $1,000 for the truck.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nDid he give you the title so you could sell it?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nNo, that’s what the issue is. I couldn’t take the truck because he never showed me ownership of the vehicle. He never had a title for it. If you notice...\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nWhat did you do with my property for four days? He left it outside. It was out there for... I don't know how long.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nWhere did you park it?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nHe parked it on a street parking outside the shop.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nIs that not on my property?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nI never took possession of it.\n\nJudge:\nWait a second, he had it towed?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nYes, he had it towed. If he had it towed, how can it be parked outside?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nYeah, they left it. They parked it in a parking spot outside on the street.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nNo, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what happens? Four days later, you get a call from the police because your car has been stolen. The truck was stolen?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nDecember 12th, 6:30 in the morning, I’m notified by the lieutenant of the Marcus Police Department that my 1998 GMC was in the custody of the Lower Southampton police department, and then I even signed a vehicle release report. With this release, he was able to recover the truck.\n\nJudge:\nSo who ends up taking it out of the impound?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nYou do, upon his permission.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nI did.\n\nJudge:\nBut why, if he parks his car on the street and it gets towed, why are you taking it out of impound?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nThe tow company that we used, that dropped off his car, is the same company I use to go down. I told him about the expense, and I texted him about the amount. He agreed to get it out. When I come out of work, I’ll reimburse you for it.\n\nJudge:\nIs that in the text somewhere?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nThat’s in my text.\n\nJudge:\nShow me the text.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nWhile you're looking for that, he takes it out of impound. He pays $650 to take it out of impound. What day do you take it out of impound?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nA day before Christmas.\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nThe day before Christmas, he takes it out of impound. The car is brought over to his place of business, right? He has it now. You go to pick it up, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nWhen I go to pick up the vehicle, I look at the vehicle. Both of the mirrors are busted, the ignition’s busted, the glass inside is busted. You have pictures of the vehicle?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nHe wouldn't let me...\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nLet me tell you why I couldn’t take pictures. Even with my antique phone... but I said to Alex, you know what, Alex, forget it. I'm just going to take the vehicle, and I'm going to take it with me. So he says, okay. He goes in his office, comes back with a piece of paper, hands it to me, and the paper says, “You owe me $650.” I’m like, for what? He says, “I paid for the towing and the storage and the days that I delayed in picking up the vehicle.” So he says to me, “You’re not taking the vehicle until you pay me.” And I’m like, well, I’m calling 911. I go outside. I call 911. They’re going to send a police officer, and all I hear is Alex saying, “That’s it. Shut the place down.” The gates go down, the locks go in, the keys go to lock, and Alex... I said, “Are you leaving?” I just called the police. He said, “I’m out of here.” He’s out of there, and I’m in there like an idiot with my phone. Finally, I wait half an hour. The police arrive, and at the end of the day, I do have a Philadelphia police report because that was a requirement to get the vehicle released from Southampton. The police tell me, “Well, you already have a police report, it’s recovered. You know where it’s at. This is a civil matter. We’re investigating murders and robberies and everything else. We can’t do anything else.”\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so here's what happens. I see that on... there's a couple of texts that don't really matter to me, and then at 12:19, the car has not been removed yet. You say to him, “I don’t have $500 to invest in your truck the week before Christmas.” Sorry. He answers to you, “You still have not picked up the truck.” Well, this is not an investment. Alex, you were recovering a vehicle that was in your possession. Please don’t take my kindness for weakness. I work for some very powerful attorneys, and I am politically tied in. I will work with you and put up half. Need an answer now. Let's stay on good terms and out of court. Your response is, “I’m having it picked up tomorrow. Can’t sell without the title.” He then says, “I hope so. Alex, you are an excellent mechanic. I value this relationship. I will bring you the title. Let’s see how bad the damage is. Hope truck is not totaled. Is the ignition busted? It’s amazing how good it looks just like you left it.” Did you...?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nIt looks terrible.\n\nJudge:\nLooks terrible. You have pictures of the truck?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nYes, ma'am.\n\nJudge:\nWhat is your position that he agreed to pay half of the impound fees?\n\nPlaintiff (Angelo Carion):\nYeah, but that's not your position. That's not what you said in here, and that's not what he says.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nWhen he came to pick up the car, I told him to pay me $650.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you take the $650 if it wasn't your agreement?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nBecause he jumped in the car and started pulling it out without paying.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you tell him to pay you $325?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nI agreed to $325 plus the title so that when I sell the car, I can recover the other half.\n\nJudge:\nNone of that is in your texts.\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nNo, I agreed to the $325 plus the title.\n\nJudge:\nWhy don't you say that in the texts? Why don't you say that in court?\n\nDefendant (Axel Rodriguez):\nI will... I was trying to explain that I agreed to $325 plus the title.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you’re making the situation confusing now. But listen. I am going to order you to pay $325 for the impound fee because that’s what you agreed to. That’s what you acted on to get the truck out. You’re not entitled to any other damages because he left the vehicle there.

I know that because those bills were received by me in Switzerland. I’m an estate attorney. My deceased client had a safe deposit box in Switzerland. I personally traveled to Switzerland. The box was drilled in my presence and I physically carried the currency back to the United States. I placed the currency in my desk drawer where I had placed it for a short period of time—three days.\n\nPlaintiff (Brian):\nI remember distinctly seeing the money in my desk drawer and saying to myself, “I have to take this money to the bank.” But I wasn’t able to get to the bank for three days. I was the last person to leave the office that night. When I returned in the morning, the envelope wasn’t there.\n\nPlaintiff (Brian):\nI doubted myself a bit at first and said, \"Did I put it in the file? Did I put it in a different desk drawer?\" But I could not find it. I contacted the defendant, and although he made a stop by my office, I wasn't available to speak to him. I emailed him but never heard back again.\n\nPlaintiff (Brian):\nI’m suing him for improper supervision of his staff. I heard that the defendant’s position is that he has one employee who has worked for him for 20 years, but that’s not so. They've only been cleaning my office suite for about a month prior to this incident. I saw four or five different people come into the office, all of whom had their own set of keys during the period in question.\n\nDefendant (Ron):\nI’ve been doing this since 1985. We’re always the first ones to be blamed. If something’s missing, fingers are always pointed at the cleaners. I understand that’s the nature of the business. We’re rarely the culprits, if ever. The person in question has been with me for 20 years.\n\nDefendant (Ron):\nOrlando is the person who was cleaning the plaintiff's space. He has been with me since 1994. He’s been out at times due to a prostate operation, but when he was available, he was assigned to the plaintiff’s space. The plaintiff claims that Orlando is the one who took the money.\n\nDefendant (Ron):\nWe can’t prove who took it, but we know Orlando has been with us for a long time and we trust him. There’s no way he would have taken anything.\n\nPlaintiff (Brian):\nThe cleaning company sent different people into my office. It’s not just Orlando.\n\nDefendant (Ron):\nI vouch for Orlando. He has been with me for 20 years. I don’t know how he could be blamed for this.\n\nDefendant (Ron):\nWe don’t have a definitive answer. It’s hard to prove who took the money, but I don’t believe it was my employee.\n\nJudge:\nBrian, what evidence do you have that Orlando took it?\n\nPlaintiff (Brian):\nIt’s circumstantial, Your Honor. I was the last one to leave and the first one in. I’m fairly certain it was there, but now it’s missing.\n\nJudge:\nYou don’t have evidence that the cleaning staff stole anything. You don’t have any proof that Orlando took the money. Maybe you’re just a little more careless than you’d like to admit.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re assuming someone took it, but you don’t have concrete proof. You’re questioning yourself about whether you saw it or not.

It shouldn’t have happened because all I asked her to do was pay her insurance every month on time.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nShe stopped. She didn’t want to pay her insurance one month because we had gotten to an altercation, an argument.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the altercation or argument about?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nWell, my best friend is her son’s baby mother, so I guess she said something to my cousin, went back, and he got back to her. She got upset, said she wasn’t going to pay the insurance.\n\nJudge:\nAccording to you, she stopped paying insurance to get back at you for being gossipy, I guess, in her eyes?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, according to you, what is it that happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nWhat happened was Nicole wanted to use the car one day, your car that’s registered in her name. Does she have a car, another car?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nHer own car.\n\nJudge:\nWhat kind of car are you driving?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nA Honda Accord.\n\nJudge:\nWhat year was your car?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nA ’95.\n\nJudge:\nAnd yours is a ’95, okay. So go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nOkay, so I... You have another car registered in her name before that, a what?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nA Cadillac.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nSo she kept calling the phone wanting to use the car. My kids called me too, was like, \"Nicole’s parked in the back by your car.\" I said, \"Yeah, she wants to use the car but I’m not going to let her. Don’t give her my keys.\" We just ignored her calls, so she got the message. She left. That’s when she told Mel, whatever I said, and that’s how everything snowballed.\n\nJudge:\nOh, so you say that the reason she got gossipy was because she was mad you didn’t loan her the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nThere you go. That’s exactly what happened.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and you say the reason she didn’t loan you the car was because you got gossipy?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nNo. What happened was she came three days later, took the plates off the car, said, \"I’m taking the car off the insurance.\" She left with the plates.\n\nJudge:\nThis was April 6th?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nInsurance wasn’t due to April 23rd.\n\nJudge:\nStop. A second, let me just ask you this. Is that accurate that insurance was due April 23rd?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nNo, it was going to cancel on April 20th if we didn’t pay by the 20th.\n\nJudge:\nSo nothing was owed on the insurance on the day that you take the plates?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nAnd according to you, she took the plates in April?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nWhat happened with the plate was Nicole took the plates twice. She took them the first time, like I said, she brought them back a couple of hours later. My husband called me. He said she bought the plates back.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you take the plates?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nI didn’t take the plates until the end of July.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, but she says you still took the car to the yard.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nSo now she comes in August to take the plates.\n\nJudge:\nRight. She wants to take the car.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nShe wants to take the car because she has the police and she has the title, and the police sees the title, and he’s like, \"I’ve got to go with this.\"\n\nJudge:\nShe didn’t get the car because I didn’t have the key to the car.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nBut she took her plates, the key.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, you did. You had the key.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nAlright, so go on. She took her plates and she left.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, then I had to park on the street, so they impounded it because it wasn’t registered to be on the street.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nWhy is the impounding her fault when you knew that you had a car with no plates at all and you’re parking it on the street?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nBecause I couldn’t register my car because she wouldn’t give me my title back.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, you don’t deny that she’s the one who’s paying for the car, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nLet’s get to why you won’t cooperate first. Alright, your counterclaim includes $1,065, $8 a day from April 21st to August 31st because the registration got canceled because she didn’t pay her part of the insurance. But you knew that she hadn’t paid her part of the insurance, so why didn’t you just take the plates sooner?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nThe day I went to her house to get the plates, she exclaimed the first time I went there. She called my grandma complaining. My grandma said, “Nicole, don’t worry about it. If she wants those plates, let her have them.”\n\nJudge:\nThat’s when I got in the mail this letter right here stating every day that the plates are out, it’s going to be $8 a day.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nRight. But then why are you listening to your grandmother? Your grandmother’s—you have to protect yourself.\n\nJudge:\nYou knew that it was $8 a day.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nBut it turns out it was, yes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you find out she has two tickets. You have a $100 ticket, a Cadillac. That’s how I knew you drove a Cadillac. And you have a $50 ticket, right?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nI don’t know nothing about that ticket either. Show me proof for that. I don’t know nothing about—I didn’t get no tickets on the Cadillac.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nThe plaintiff signed the car she bought over to her niece because the plaintiff’s license was suspended, but the defendants stopped paying insurance and the car got towed. Feels like the reason is that these girls got gossipy. Let’s listen.\n\nJudge:\nWhere do you live?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nI live in Pipy, New York.\n\nJudge:\nBecause the $50 ticket has a plate that is NY. Who has that plate?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nHer Honda. Does that sound right?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nI—I don’t remember the plate number. They don’t even put the name of the car.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nWell, they did. You know what they put?\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nWhat?\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nHonda. They didn’t put the year.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nActually, I don’t even think they put that on this one. They didn’t because she has a Honda too.\n\nDefendant (Nicole Kaiser):\nSo I know I got—I didn’t bring it with me. I don’t never do that to you.\n\nJudge:\n5-10-12... Oh, by street cleaning? Yeah, I did get that ticket. I remember that because I was by my sister.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, um, what you’re suing for, several things, you’re suing for $315 to restart your insurance. Show me something from the insurance as proof.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nThat’s for, um, the cancellation for the insurance.\n\nJudge:\nShow me proof of the $315.\n\nPlaintiff (Juny Kaiser):\nI didn’t print it out.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "Playing the victim Emotional appeal Persuasion"}
{"id": "130", "dialogue": "Judge: Hope Flanigan, you are suing your former boyfriend, Michael Pendergrass, for $496.29. You say he owes you for numerous items you bought for your shared apartment. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Hope Flanigan): We met in July of 2018 through mutual friends on Facebook. It was love at first sight, and we moved in together in August 2018.\n\nJudge: You moved in after knowing him for a month?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you do that often?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: And how did that work out?\n\nPlaintiff: We broke up in December 2018.\n\nJudge: Not too well then. Did you move from somewhere?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I moved from Georgia to be with him.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t just move in together, you moved states? And you purchased household furniture?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I had no furniture of my own at the time.\n\nJudge: Didn’t you have furniture from your previous living situation?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I was living with my parents after my previous marriage ended.\n\nJudge: What happened in your previous marriage?\n\nPlaintiff: It was volatile. He had jealous rages, accused me of cheating, and went through my phone. There was no cheating, but a friend from high school texted things he shouldn't have.\n\nJudge: So you and Michael broke up in December. What happened to the furniture?\n\nPlaintiff: I moved out with only my clothes. I had no way to take the furniture with me.\n\nJudge: Did you ask for the furniture back?\n\nPlaintiff: Not immediately, but in January, I went with my cousins and a trailer to retrieve it. He told me I wasn’t getting anything and that he paid for everything.\n\nJudge: Michael, what's your response?\n\nDefendant (Michael Pendergrass): When I lived in Georgia, I had my own apartment and furniture. She asked me to sell it and start fresh. She didn’t want furniture that had belonged to another woman.\n\nJudge: What did you do with the money from selling your furniture?\n\nDefendant: We used it to secure the new apartment.\n\nJudge: Who paid the rent?\n\nDefendant: I did. It was $1,200 a month.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t she contribute?\n\nDefendant: Because she's a woman. It was my job to pay.\n\nJudge: (Sarcastically) Oh, well, that's an interesting philosophy.\n\nPlaintiff: I paid for the furniture and household items on my credit cards. I have about $5,000 in debt now. He has everything because I had nowhere to put it.\n\nJudge: Michael, you took the furniture when you moved out?\n\nDefendant: Yes, to my new place in Leesburg, Florida.\n\nJudge: Hope, you want him to pay off your credit card debt. Why do you believe he owes it?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he agreed to split things but never paid his share.\n\nJudge: Michael, did you ever pay for any of the furniture?\n\nDefendant: I paid rent, and I also made payments on her credit cards for six months.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s not true. He only made three partial payments.\n\nJudge: Hope, do you have documentation of the charges and payments?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have my credit card statements showing purchases and remaining balances.\n\nJudge: Michael, do you have proof of payments?\n\nDefendant: No, I broke my phone, so I lost the texts where she said she didn’t want the furniture.\n\nJudge: Hope, did you ever tell him he could keep the furniture?\n\nPlaintiff: Only if he paid off the debt.\n\nJudge: (Sighs) Do you have any texts confirming this?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it was verbal.\n\nJudge: So we have a situation where Hope put all the purchases on her credit cards, Michael continued living in the apartment using the furniture after the breakup, and he later took everything with him to a new location. Hope, you're seeking reimbursement for the remaining balances. Michael, you're claiming that since you paid rent, you don’t owe more.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting, deflection"}
{"id": "920", "dialogue": "Announcer:\n\"This is the plaintiff, Keith Curtain. He says the defendant is his son-in-law, and he borrowed $3,900 from him and hasn’t paid him back. It pains him to have to sue his son-in-law in court, but family or no family, he’s owed $3,900, and he wants it. He wants it now, so he’s suing.\"\n\n\"This is the defendant, Chris. He says his father-in-law was being nice because he and his daughter were trying to buy a house. Unfortunately, the plaintiff’s daughter is an alcoholic who’s been in and out of rehab, so they never got the house. It’s his daughter’s fault that the deal fell through. The money the plaintiff gave them went towards his daughter’s rehab, and he owes them nothing. He’s accused of doing a father-in-law wrong.\"\n\nBailiff:\n\"All parties, please rise.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff is suing his son-in-law, who borrowed nearly $4,000. The defendant says the problem is that the plaintiff’s daughter is an alcoholic, and that derailed the home purchase. So it’s her fault, not his. It’s the case of You Don’t Know Jack.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Where are the women in your lives, gentlemen? They left you to battle this out alone?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Keith Curtain):\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"All right, Keith Curtain and Alice Curtain—you have power of attorney for Alice, your wife. Chris, you are married to Keith and Alice’s daughter, correct?\"\n\nDefendant (Chris):\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Okay. Now, Mr. Curtain and Mrs. Curtain are suing you for $3,900, a balance of a loan that they made to you under certain conditions and that you supposedly have not repaid. Let me hear from you first.\"\n\nPlaintiff:\n\"All right, Your Honor. The defendant contacted my wife and told her he was having a problem trying to get a house that he and my daughter were trying to obtain. He said that he had three loans that he had to pay off in order to turn his credit rating around so that he could get the approval for the loan. My wife and I talked about it, and we did give him a $4,000 loan with the stipulation that if he did not take the house, then that would then become a loan. And if he did take the house, then the $4,000 was considered a gift.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"So, like a housewarming gift? Because you wanted your daughter to be living in a home that they co-owned, correct?\"\n\nPlaintiff:\n\"Correct, because they didn’t own a home at that point.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"So, as an incentive, you said, 'If you get the house, you don’t have to pay me back, but if you don’t, you do have to pay me back?'\"\n\nPlaintiff:\n\"Yes, ma’am.\"\n\nJudge (to Defendant):\n\"And was that your understanding as well?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Yes, ma’am.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"So why are we here? Because you feel that you should not have to pay it back because the reason you didn’t get the house wasn’t your fault—it was his daughter’s fault, in your eyes. So tell me what’s going on there.\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"At the very least, it should only be viable for half of it. But let me explain what happened.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"The circumstances were that when I was trying to get the house, I was approved for it. And due to the addictions that my wife has—\"\n\nJudge:\n\"What are the addictions your wife has?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"She’s addicted to alcohol and other recreational drugs occasionally.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Do you have children?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Yes, we have two children—two and four.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Jeez. Go ahead.\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"It got to the point where I hid it from everybody for over a year and a half before it just started spiraling.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"What kind of other recreational drugs, just so I have a handle on what we’re talking about?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"I’m pretty sure she was doing cocaine and marijuana too.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Was she doing that when you met her?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"She had had a previous addiction but had not been drinking for several years.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"All right, so what happens?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"It got so bad that she’d completely lose control. She’d take off and be gone, like on Valentine’s Day. She took off, didn’t come home, wound up hooking up with an Uber driver.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"How do you know she hooked up with an Uber driver?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"She told me.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"And where were the kids when she took off?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"I had them.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"And then what happened?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"I finally just got to where it was too much, and I told her she had to go to rehab or we’d separate. She took off for a week and then came back and finally decided to go to rehab. And I paid—the first initial payment was $3,750 to get her into rehab.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Did you let her choose which rehab?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Yes, she chose one in the mountains in Ohio. It required all this mountain gear, extra stuff, and it was $1,500 worth of supplies. But I said, 'I don’t care. I’ll pay whatever it takes.' I took three days off work, drove her to Ohio, dropped her off.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"And then?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"A day after I got home, she already got in a fight and was being flown back.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"With whom?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Another person in rehab.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Did they both get thrown out?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"I don’t know, but I know the other person needed medical attention.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Has she ever been violent?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Oh yeah, very much so.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"So you are presently separated from her?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"And who has the children?\"\n\nPlaintiff:\n\"We do.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Accurate?\"\n\nDefendant:\n\"Yes, but they won’t give them back.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"You have to go to court for that. Grandparents don’t have rights, no matter how much they help.\"\n\nPlaintiff:\n\"But he threatened to take the kids to New Mexico and not bring them back.\"\n\nJudge:\n\"Unless he’s legally deemed unfit, they are his children. Now, about this loan—Chris, you owe them the money.

All right, tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: It was March 7th. I was walking my dog. I had left my house, and I do like a three-mile course.\n\nJudge: Wow, is that for you or for the dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Both of us.\n\nJudge: Wow, you come to my house and walk my dog because I don’t really want to walk my dog for three miles.

I had another mile to get home.\n\nJudge: What kind of dog?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a Jack Russell Terrier.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: He’s about 16 pounds. I passed her house. There were two dogs outside. They actually scared me. There are no sidewalks over there where her house is, so you walk in the street in that part. They were barking like crazy, pulling on the leash. I hear her say to the lady that’s in the black Yukon talking to her in the driveway, \"Wow, my dog almost pulled your bumper off.\" And I just keep walking. Now, I’m about 10 houses up the street, and I hear, \"Coco, stop! Coco, stop! Pick up your dog, Mister! Pick up your dog!\" I do one of these over my shoulder and I go, \"Oh, you know what?\" And this dog’s charging at me with its leash dragging, and another dog is next to it—a black dog.\n\nJudge: She's running behind?\n\nPlaintiff: The black dog that’s next to it is also on a leash.\n\nJudge: No leash on that dog?\n\nPlaintiff: That black dog was hers.\n\nJudge: Okay, so both?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, got it. Both dogs were running up the street.\n\nJudge: Did you pick up your dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did. He’s in a harness, you know, so I just grabbed the harness, threw him up on my shoulder. The dog came closer. I turned around to give it my back. It came around. I did a circle to try and keep my back towards the dog. The dog got around me, jumped up, grabbed my—\n\nJudge: The black one or the other one?\n\nPlaintiff: The Shepherd mix.\n\nJudge: Which is the one that was on a leash or off a leash?\n\nPlaintiff: On a leash that was dragging behind it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff: It got around me, bit my dog and myself. So, you know, I let out a yell, my dog of course, and so did I. She fell down, and I go, \"Get up and get your dog!\" You know, and she’s like, \"Oh!\" She gets up and grabs the dog’s leash.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, she fell down on purpose?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no. She fell down as she was running after the two dogs.\n\nJudge: All right, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: She pulled the dog off me. She was crying. My dog was holding against me. I didn’t even notice at that point. He must have spun around, and the side that got bit—his right side—was up against my sweatshirt. He was just shaking. My finger was bleeding. I got bit across my finger.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: May I see them?\n\nPlaintiff: Sure. I also have them on an iPad if you want.\n\nDefendant: Honey, we have to walk the dogs around the front of the house to the backyard. So my girlfriend pulled up, and my dogs got excited because they know her car. At that precise moment, Mr. Booth was walking past the house. I went to walk my dogs into the house, but they wanted to go because they saw Mike. The leash got stuck on the bumper. Coco went around the car. I got the leash off the bumper, took them into the house. As I got up the stairs, our front door was broken—\n\nJudge: Zeke, the black dog, was inside?\n\nDefendant: Yes, he pushed the door open and ran out.\n\nJudge: So you have three dogs?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: The only thing you didn’t feel was appropriate to pay for was what?\n\nDefendant: A day’s pay that he got paid for because he took a sick day, and his sunglasses.\n\nJudge: But you agree your dog was responsible for this incident?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I do, but I don’t believe the sunglasses were even there.\n\nJudge: You’re saying he’s lying about that part?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Mr. Booth, do you have proof of the sunglasses’ value?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a receipt for the same pair purchased last year.\n\nJudge: I’ll review that. Final statements?\n\nPlaintiff: I just want to be compensated for what I lost. It wasn’t my fault.\n\nDefendant: I understand, but I still feel some of this is excessive.\n\nJudge: I will issue my ruling shortly.

{"id": "1003", "dialogue": "**Judge:**\nThank you, Douglas. Okay, Joseph Rotoni?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nYes, your honor.\n\n**Judge:**\nYou are suing Neil McGregor for $34.95?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nThat's correct.\n\n**Judge:**\nWhich, according to you, he owes you to fix a problem that he created with your dryer?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nYes.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay. First of all, you're wearing these sunglasses because?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nI've been visually impaired due to a disease I have.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay, I'm sorry to hear that. Normally, we ask you to take your glasses off.\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nI will.\n\n**Judge:**\nNo, no. Leave them on if you need to. It's fine. All right. So tell me what happened here.\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nOkay. Let me first explain, your honor. Mr. McGregor has done a lot of work for myself and my wife at our home, and we've never had a problem. Whenever we've called him, he's come over, he's done the job, and we paid him.\n\n**Judge:**\nFor how many years have you used him?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nWell, I've known Mr. McGregor for 27 years. He at one time worked for my wife. I'd say five or six years since I knew he was doing work on the side, and he's been very good. We had a nice rapport.\n\n**Judge:**\nIn what capacity did you work for his wife?\n\n**Defendant:**\nBoston City Hospital. She was a food service director, and I worked under her.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay. So go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nOkay. This particular time, Mr. McGregor was at the house doing some work that I had requested. Everything went fine. There was one last issue that had to be taken care of, and that was to reconnect the vent dryer.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nMr. McGregor was reconnecting the vent from the rear of the dryer to the outside part of the house. There's a vent inside that goes right outside the exterior of the home.\n\n**Judge:**\nWhy was it disconnected?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nThey come apart often, probably from usage, but other than that, I don't know.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay.\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nSo in any case, he completed that, and rather than just coming around the dryer, Mr. McGregor elected to climb over it.\n\n**Judge:**\nAfter reconnecting it?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nYes.\n\n**Judge:**\nBecause he didn’t disconnect it?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nCorrect.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo after he reconnects it, he then walks on the dryer?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nNo. Instead of coming around the dryer like he should have done—\n\n**Judge:**\nHow did he get up behind the thing?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nHe hopped over it. He leaped up, and when he attempted to go over, he landed on the backsplash of the dryer.\n\n**Defendant:**\nThere was no room to go around it. The only way to get behind it was to climb over the dryer. I had to climb over, get myself on the other side, and then check the line.\n\n**Judge:**\nHow’d you even do that? Did you lie on top of the dryer?\n\n**Defendant:**\nNo, I had to put my knee up, then both knees, and climb over.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo you had your knees on the dryer?\n\n**Defendant:**\nRight. And then I climbed over to the back.\n\n**Judge:**\nThen what happened?\n\n**Defendant:**\nAs I was climbing back, the loop of my pants caught the knobs on the dryer, and they broke.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay. What happened next?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nTwo knobs on the dryer were sheared off. One controlled the temperature, and I had to use the dryer on high heat all the time.\n\n**Judge:**\nHow much was the cost?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\n$75 for the two knobs.\n\n**Judge:**\nDo you have proof?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nI don’t have a written estimate, but I contacted a few service companies.\n\n**Judge:**\nThat’s not enough. You need evidence.\n\n**Defendant:**\nI checked online but never ordered them. Then, after threats and repeated calls, I stopped responding.\n\n**Judge:**\nIf you break something while doing a favor, you're responsible. I'm ruling in favor of the plaintiff for $150.\n\n**Court adjourns.**\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization"}

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff bought a car from the defendant and is now having issues with the title. The defendant claims the title is fine, but the plaintiff changed his mind. It’s the case of Every Lawsuit Has a Title.\n\nThank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Mr. Santos, you bought a car from Milross Rodriguez, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: How much did you pay for it?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,500.\n\nJudge: Did you get a title when you bought it?\n\nPlaintiff: I got a title, yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see the title. Was there a bill of sale?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a handwritten note.\n\nJudge: Let me see both of those. So was this your car?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it was.\n\nJudge: How long had you been driving it?\n\nDefendant: It was actually parked and was supposed to be registered. It was never registered. My sister was supposed to register it.\n\nJudge: Whose car was this?\n\nDefendant: It's mine. I was the one who bought the car.\n\nJudge: You paid the money?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: And who was supposed to be driving it?\n\nDefendant: My sister, Marissa Rodriguez.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nDefendant: We sold it. She left for Boston, Massachusetts, so I sold the car.\n\nJudge: Let me get everybody’s name straight. You’re Raymond Santos, and you’re Milross Rodriguez, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Whose signature is this that says Michael on the title?\n\nDefendant: That would probably be the first person that the car was purchased from, I believe.\n\nJudge: Who’s \"they\"?\n\nDefendant: The person I purchased the car from.\n\nJudge: I have to ask you—you’re the only person who knows where you bought the car. So, you bought it from whom?\n\nDefendant: Cherry Street.\n\nJudge: Is your name even on this title?\n\nDefendant: Is her name on the title at all?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s the problem I’m having.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that’s a problem. Your name’s not even on the title.\n\nDefendant: I could have sworn the title is under Marissa Rodriguez.\n\nJudge: That’s not you, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Number one. But number two, her name isn’t on the title either. You mean your sister?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Hand this title to her. Show me where I’m missing it. Maybe I’m missing something.\n\nJudge: Did you try to register the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: Is your name on that title?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Is your sister’s name on the title?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it’s not.\n\nJudge: So what happened here? You tried to register it, and what did they say?\n\nPlaintiff: They said it’s not filled out correctly, so I have to go back to the seller and ask them to request a new title with their name on it. They have to just re-sign it back. It’s called \"jumping title,\" and it’s a problem.\n\nJudge: So did you contact her and say, \"Hey, we need to figure this out, I need to ask for a new title?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I did.\n\nJudge: And what did she say?\n\nPlaintiff: She indicated that she would help me with that, but then she texted me later that she was running into some personal problems and couldn’t help me anymore.\n\nJudge: Is that accurate?\n\nDefendant: That’s accurate to a certain extent. At the time, I was in the process of moving, and I did tell him that. I asked if he could be a little more patient with me.\n\nJudge: So did you have any further contact with her after this?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but once she told me she was moving, I went into panic mode and went to the court system because I was afraid of losing contact with her.\n\nJudge: So what you’re suing for is the $1,500 that you paid, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: See, when you sell a car, it’s an \"as-is\" sale. The only thing you can’t do is sell something that isn’t legally transferable. If he can’t register it, he can’t drive it. If you do something funky with the title or refuse to help, that becomes a problem. And now he gets to rescind this contract.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything to say in your defense that you haven’t already said?\n\nDefendant: Does he get to keep the $1,500 and the car?\n\nJudge: No, the car goes back to its rightful owner. You’re not the owner, and you don’t have a way to prove it.\n\nJudge: Do you have a bill of sale that shows that you bought it?\n\nDefendant: I should have one at home.\n\nJudge: Wow. I don’t know what we’re going to do. Here’s what we’re going to do—because you don’t get to keep it if you want the $1,500. We’re going to make arrangements for you to surrender it to the police station. Let somebody else figure it out.\n\nDefendant: That sounds reasonable.\n\nJudge: How are you going to prove ownership?\n\nDefendant: I should have proof at home.\n\nJudge: The proof I’m talking about is a bill of sale.\n\nDefendant: Yes, I understand.\n\nJudge: If you show me the bill of sale and it doesn’t look fake, I will make arrangements through the courthouse for the car to go back to you. On your claim against her, I’m ruling in your favor for $1,500.\n\nJudge: Judgment for the plaintiff.

{"id": "908", "dialogue": "Judge: Landlord, all parties please raise your right hand. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in the docket, the plaintiff moved into the defendant's house. It was awful, there were all sorts of leaks and whatnot, but the defendant says the plaintiff never paid squat. Into the case of the squatter with no water.\nJudge: Richard and Doris Washington, you have power of attorney representing both you and who's that - your wife? Okay. You are suing Leslie Jackson, your former landlord for the $300 remaining from the security deposit that Mr. Jackson has not returned to you. Tell me what's going on.\nPlaintiff: On around October 1st 2011, my wife and I moved onto the first floor of his private house, and because of problems with the electricity-\nJudge: What was the problem with the electricity?\nPlaintiff: Well, whenever he would leave town, the electricity would go off and on, off and on.\nJudge: The actual lights?\nPlaintiff: Yes, the lights, everything would go off.\nJudge: Until what?\nPlaintiff: Until he had someone fix it. And when he left town twice, it happened twice when he left town. The hot water went off as well.\nJudge: The hot water and the electricity would go off and then you would call him and then he would have somebody fix it?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, sometimes the person that was staying in the basement with him would have to contact someone to fix it.\nJudge: How would they fix it?\nPlaintiff: He had it rigged up from his basement to our electrical power, his power to our power. And when they came, from what I understand, when they came up and down the steps they would unplug it by mistake, hit the plug and it would knock out my plug, my electricity. The front window wouldn't shut all the way or lock. He said he would fix that, never was fixed. The roof started leaking-\nJudge: You lived in the first floor with your own kitchen, a whole separate family unit, right?\nPlaintiff: The roof started leaking eventually. The ceiling fell in on my furniture.\nJudge: What do you mean from the water filling up on a ceiling from the outside of the roof?\nPlaintiff: Well, you're on the first floor and there's another floor above you.\nJudge: Or no, there's another floor above us?\nPlaintiff: Yes, but there's an outside roof that doesn't cover the first floor- I mean the second floor.\nJudge: So you are the topmost floor at a certain portion of your place?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: So then tell me about when you decide that you're leaving. Are you on a month-to-month with him, is that how it works?\nPlaintiff: No, it was from August 1st of 2011 to August 1st of 2012.\nJudge: But you decide to leave when?\nPlaintiff: We decided to leave around October 27th actually.\nJudge: And so when you told him you were leaving, did he object because you had a lease or no?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: Because you told him I'm leaving because of all the problems and he did not object to that?\nPlaintiff: No, he didn't.\nJudge: So you leave and then he gives you $1,000?\nPlaintiff: When he gives us $1,000 about a week after we leave. He wouldn't do the walkthrough with my wife.\nJudge: Did you leave the place clean?\nPlaintiff: Yes we did.\nJudge: Did you take any pictures of how you left the place?\nPlaintiff: Someone was supposed to email me the pictures this morning but I never got them.\nJudge: Why are you keeping his 300 bucks?\nDefendant: The agreement that Mr. Washington and his wife and I made was $1,300 rent and they will go half on the electricity.\nJudge: But how is your electricity rigged up there? Is it-\nDefendant: I don't know what this individual is talking about because it's a two-family house. It has two legal meters but I stay in the basement.\nJudge: So the basement is attached to the first floor, right? Then you rent out two of them and then you're living in another one which you're not allowed to do.\nDefendant: Excuse me-\nJudge: You know exactly what I said. I don't need to repeat my- you know exactly what I said.\nDefendant: I'm holding-\nJudge: I'm holding- please be silent on that one.\nDefendant: Of course.\nJudge: You're going to be silent. So you have some fugazi thing rigged up with- wait, what is that if the tenant says it's okay? Can a landlord rent an illegal house?\nDefendant: I would say no.\nJudge: Why?\nDefendant: It's still against the law. I'd be like going to the grocery store and saying I'm going to steal a camera because you said it was okay.\nJudge: Except they would never say it was okay. There's a flaw in your argument.\nDefendant: Oh that's true.\nJudge: Go inside the courtroom. The electricity from the first floor is connected to the basement where the two meters- the two meters on the outside for the first floor apart, the second floor apartment which is a two-family house. Second floor has their own apartment, their own meter and the first floor which is connected to the basement has his own meter.\nJudge: And then what happened?\nDefendant: The electricity did go off. I was away.\nJudge: How did it go off?\nDefendant: The non-payment. I was late on a payment. And they cut it off but it went right back on the same day.\nJudge: What about the roof problems? I'm going to get to that.\nDefendant: We had a storm and when we had the storm the roof, a part of the shingles fell off.\nJudge: When did that happen?\nDefendant: The last storm we had besides Sandy but, you know, last year. I forgot what storm we had.\nJudge: When did that happen?\nPlaintiff: It was Hurricane Irene.\nJudge: When?\nPlaintiff: It was in like September.\nJudge: So if there- why hadn't the roof been fixed in two months?\nDefendant: I'm getting ready to tell you-\nJudge: No, in two months the roof was fixed right away. First of all, by law you had 72 hours to repair the-\nJudge: Did his ceiling fall in?\nDefendant: The ceiling did fall in. The ceiling fell in, a lot of water was coming and I fixed it right away.\nJudge: According to you he left it that way. How long about the ceiling or the roof?\nDefendant: Well first the roof has to get fixed. We need to make sure it doesn't leak, then the ceiling needs to get fixed. There's an order to these things.\nPlaintiff: The roof was never fixed because it always had a garbage bag.\nJudge: Do you have pictures of a fixed roof?\nDefendant: No I don't.\nJudge: All right, why are you keeping the 300 bucks?\nDefendant: Well the reason why I'm keeping the $300 is because the agreement that his wife and I made- put it like this, the agreement that the head of the household and I made-\nJudge: Why you laughing? No, that I know he intended- I know that he intended it as an insult to him but I want to know why you're laughing because of the insult and no more, right? You're not like implying that a woman can't be the head of the household. I mean because usually there's a division of labor and like in my house my husband believes that the natural state of an envelope is sealed and an email is unreturned and a phone call is unreturned so the person who handles all this stuff would be me, exactly.\nDefendant: If I'm lying then please penalize me for me lying but I am speak-\nJudge: No, I'm not going to probably penalize you for lying. What I'm going to penalize you for is having an illegal apartment.\nDefendant: No, what we going to do-\nJudge: What we're going to do- see here's the thing. Let's just say that you sold him cocaine and then- like why- let me just explain to you it's a concept I want to explain. So you sell him- no let's do it the other way so that way you can feel it. He sells you cocaine and then you take the cocaine and then you take it back to your place and you realize that only the top of it where you went like that was cocaine and then the bottom of it was laundry detergent. And so now you're angry because you paid him for an entire kilo of cocaine so you come to court and you sue him and say judge he ripped me off, he has breached contract and I want my money back for my cocaine. Would a judge ever get involved in such a thing? Of course not because as a public policy, we do not sit around enforcing illegal things. You've kept $300 for electricity that you've got rigged up in a house you're using as a-\nDefendant: Sorry I'm in the middle of speaking but-\nJudge: No, no there's no but. You don't interrupt me when I'm explaining to you a house that is zoned for two family that you have rigged up for three that you somehow have- you don't have your own separate unit measuring your electricity so you have him splitting or doing paying some share of the electricity that you've got rigged up in a way that you're not allowed to rig up and you've got used as a three family that you're not allowed to use. What are the odds that I'm going to assist you?\nDefendant: No but-\nJudge: Hon, what I have to do is I have to correct you on something because the electricity is not rigged up. The first floor and the basement-\nJudge: You have a separate unit for the basement?\nDefendant: No ma'am.\nJudge: Is a separate family living in the basement?\nDefendant: I live in the basement.\nJudge: That's right and you are not part of his family right?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: And you are renting to him a completely separate facility with its own kitchen and bathroom in the basement?\nDefendant: Okay.\nJudge: Give the man back his $300. You have no right to keep any of $300.\nJudge: For the plaintiff.\nDefendant: Wow, where's the Justice at?\nJudge: Right here baby.\nDefendant: Wow, so that- I thought the judge should have heard my case out a lot. She didn't hear my case.\nJudge: What do you have for us here that's going to blow the case wide open? Go ahead. I mean you have something to say?\nDefendant: The apartment was illegal so that's why you're leaving the court on the losing end.\nJudge: Well I guess so there.\nJudge: All right, okay, good luck.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendent", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, evasion,gaslighting,"}

She left my auntie $70, and she also left Pamela $20. I called my auntie to let her know that my mom left her $70. She said, \"Okay, Val, I'll get it when I see you.\" So I called Miss Pamela to tell her—\n\n**Judge:**\nMiss Pamela is your sister?\n\n**Plaintiff (Valerie):**\nYes, to tell her that I had $20 for her. So she started going all off, talking real rude, calling me out my name and whatnot, and she said she knows my mom didn’t leave her the money, that Mom left no money with me for her. So I said, \"You know what, Pamela? I’m not gonna give you the money.\"\n\n**Judge:**\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

And what's your version of this little conversation?\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nWell, actually, that day, how I found out—my mother calls it a \"package\"—she didn't really say it was like a bittersweet situation. Val calls me at 6:30 in the morning—she does this all the time—to tell me different little stuff about where I should be in life, where she’s at in life, whatever. So she calls me, and she was like, \"Yeah, my mommy left me a package. You ain’t going to get nothing because she gave you some pennies to give to me, and you didn’t give them to me.\"\n\n**Plaintiff (Valerie):**\nOh, that’s not true!\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nYes! My mother picks up pennies. You know, she does all kinds of stuff. I didn’t even want to take the pennies from my mom. I have a recording from my mom about the pennies. That’s what she told me.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo she tells you she's not going to give you the $20 because one day in the past, you didn't give her pennies?\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nYes. Yes.\n\n**Judge:**\nAre you both for real?\n\n**Plaintiff (Valerie):**\nVery, very for real.\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nVery for real.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo you're telling me your mother gave you $20 to give to her, but you decided you weren’t going to give it to her?\n\n**Plaintiff (Valerie):**\nNo, I didn’t say I wasn’t going to give it to her. I only said that after she said, \"I know my mom ain't leave you no $20 for me.\"\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay, so now let’s fast forward.\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nNo, no, I just—this is just too much for me.\n\n**Judge:**\nYeah, we need to fast forward to the next time you two see each other in person.

I’mma spit in your face.\" I was just trying to use psychology.\n\n**Judge:**\nOh yeah, that’s classic psychology. \"I’m going to mess up your car. I’m going to spit in your face.\" That’s an old psychology trick. I was a psychology major—there's barely a textbook in college that doesn’t have that in Psychology 101.\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nIt didn’t work! She still refused to give me the money. And I said, \"$20? Who cares?\"\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay, is that what you said?\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\nPersonally, to myself, yeah.\n\n**Judge:**\nOkay, but to her, what’d you say?\n\n**Defendant (Pamela):**\n\"I’mma mess up your car.

{"id": "833", "dialogue": "\n**Judge:** Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff parked her minivan in what she believed to be a legal spot, but it was towed. She had three kids, a full shopping cart of food, and it was 90 degrees outside. The defendant says she was parked in a fire lane and that he towed her vehicle according to the law. It's the case of crying over spilled milk.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, you are suing B&M Towing, represented here by Brian Shinan. You are the owner?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. You are suing for $5,000—most of it in punitive damages—$22.79 for spoiled milk and $4.99 for spoiled deli meat, and the cost of the tow. Because, according to you, you were inappropriately towed. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** On the day that I was towed, I went to this BJ’s shopping center, which I’ve been going to for years. I was with my three little kids, so I went to look for the closest spot—closest to the store—to reduce walking with them.\n\n**Judge:** How old are your kids?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have twin six-year-olds and an almost four-year-old.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So, you were all together?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, it was supposed to just be a quick trip. I found something in my usual area, right near the entrance. I parked my car as usual. We went in, and when I came back out, my car was gone.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, let’s slow down for a second. Let’s take a look. Does this look familiar?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, this is an aerial view of BJ’s.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Go ahead and show me where you parked.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I’ve been parking there for years. I was in between these two trees over here next to this first section.\n\n**Judge:** Hold on one second, I’ll make that bigger. Say again, where were you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right here, next to this tree.\n\n**Judge:** How next to that tree? Show me exactly where.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Usually, four cars park here—two here. I was in this first spot right there.\n\n**Judge:** So, if I had a car right here, are you saying there, like on the other side of this?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, right here, as if my finger were pointing at that spot.\n\n**Judge:** I’m not seeing white stripes there, though.\n\n**Plaintiff:** But it has been a parking spot. People are always using it. There’s no sign that says it’s a no-parking zone. I’ve been using this store for at least six years, always parking exactly right there, never getting any notification or anything. It’s always been used as a spot.\n\n**Judge:** And that car right there is parked inappropriately, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, and that one wasn’t towed. We also have pictures of a car parked there at that time, and it wasn’t taken.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, but how would that entitle you to $5,000? We can see where the parking spaces are. They are marked with white stripes, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And you were parked in an area that is presumably the egress to that in order to get out. You were parked… frankly, there should be white stripes there. I get what you’re saying—that is an enormous wasted space for BJ’s. I don’t get it, but… okay. Go ahead and sit down.\n\n(To the defendant) Did you actually do the tow? You’re the owner of the company; you didn’t personally do the tow, did you?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Do your tow people take pictures of where they towed the car from and take pictures of the car when they tow?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Do you know where the tow was from?\n\n**Defendant:** From right where she said, apparently.\n\n**Judge:** “Apparently”? But you don’t know. Why are you here and not the tow truck driver?\n\n**Defendant:** Because I’m the owner of the company.\n\n**Judge:** What are you going to be able to tell me about the facts of this case?\n\n**Defendant:** Well, I’m reading what was written: “Car was parked not between two white lines.”\n\n**Judge:** That’s not what it says. What does it say?\n\n**Defendant:** “Unattended, unoccupied vehicle parked in drive-thru lane at endcap.”\n\n**Judge:** Hold on one second. But it also marks “Blocking fire lane,” “No parking zone,” and “Traffic lane.”\n\n**Defendant:** It says “Traffic lane.”\n\n**Judge:** Alright. Did you ever have any contact with her?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** (To Plaintiff) So, you’re out there, your car is gone, and you’ve got three little kids asking, “Mommy, where’s the car?”\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. We saw immediately when we exited the store that my car wasn’t there. I asked a security guard in the parking lot if they knew where my car was. She had an attitude and said, “How am I supposed to know where your car is?”\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Then she suggested maybe I had outstanding parking tickets, which I don’t. I have a clean record. I asked if she could help me, and she said, “That’s not my job,” and drove away.\n\n**Judge:** Wow.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And it was August, 95 degrees out. I called 911 because I assumed my car was stolen. They didn’t even want to help me. They asked if it was an emergency. A pedestrian then told me they saw my car being towed.\n\n**Judge:** The problem is, you have admitted to parking where there were no white stripes. It should be a parking space, but it isn’t.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s been used forever.\n\n**Judge:** But “everybody does it” doesn’t entitle you to compensation.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Shouldn’t the security guard have told me? She works for the company.\n\n**Judge:** That’s something you can take up with BJ’s. They have never enforced this before, but suddenly they did. Maybe BJ’s owes you compensation. But that’s between you and them. As for this case, verdict for the defendant.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was a giant headache. My kids are still scared whenever I leave my car anywhere.\n\n**Judge:** I understand. But the law applies the same to everyone. Next time, park in designated spots.\n\n**Defendant:** I was not concerned coming to court at all. We get sued often.\n\n**Judge:** It doesn’t matter if a spot has been used before. If it’s illegal, it can be towed.\n\na", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal,Exaggeration"}

{"id": "62", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Khed Onala. He says he rented a house along with a roommate from the defendant, and the woman kicked him out and gave him only three days to move. The defendant was mad about an overnight guest staying in the house, but it wasn't his overnight guest—it was his roommate’s. The horrible defendant refuses to return his security deposit for no reason, and he's there suing for the $700 he still owes.\n\nThis is the defendant, Vivan Scott. She says the sneaky plaintiff tried to move someone into the house under her nose, so before things escalated, she told him he had to move out. She returned $1,000 of his security, kept $350 of it because he didn’t return the key, and she had to change the locks. So she owes nothing. She’s accused of not getting it right.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nWelcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff rented a house from the defendant, says she kicked him out with three days' notice, and she accused him of bringing in an overnight guest, which he denies. But she says he was trying to move that person in. It’s the case of Sleepover Creepover.\n\nMr. Onala, you are suing Ms. Scott, your former landlord, for two times the $350 that she withheld from your security deposit because, according to you, she kept the money wrongfully and never sent you a notice about that in writing. So, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: All right, so I moved in—well, I paid my security deposit on April 25th, 2018. I moved in May 1st. And then I was given a notice to vacate the premises on May...\n\nJudge: 30th?\n\nPlaintiff: May 30th, yeah. If I'm not—yeah.\n\nJudge: Before the month was even up?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. Like, they just—they gave me a warning, like a forewarning, on May 25th.\n\nJudge: Saying what?\n\nPlaintiff: Just saying, like, \"You’ve went against the lease by having an overnight guest.\"\n\nJudge: Because your lease says you can’t have an overnight guest without getting in contact with management first?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Now, this is—you were renting out what?\n\nPlaintiff: I was renting out an apartment, so like a whole floor in a house, rather.\n\nJudge: All right. And then who lives—how many floors are there to the house?\n\nPlaintiff: Two.\n\nJudge: And then who lives on the other floor?\n\nPlaintiff: On the other floor was her son. Acting as the property manager.\n\nJudge: So the son lives on the top?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you live there too?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. The son lives on the top, and the bottom was being rented out to you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you get a notice on May 25th saying what?\n\nPlaintiff: Saying that I was going against the lease by having an overnight guest, which was not true.\n\nJudge: And what did you do with that notice?\n\nPlaintiff: I let her know that I didn’t have any overnight guests.\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: On top of that, it was my roommate who had the guest.\n\nJudge: Okay. So it was your roommate. That’s—what, do you think that what your roommate does in the apartment doesn’t matter?\n\nPlaintiff: But what I don’t understand is—you moved out then immediately?\n\nPlaintiff: No. So that was my first warning, the 25th. And then, three—two days later, they told me to move out. I was given three days to move out.\n\nJudge: That was my first—that was your first warning? Was there another event?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. So just—they didn’t like the way you communicated, I guess?\n\nPlaintiff: Or something, and, like, my face—something. I don’t know what was going on.\n\nJudge: So they gave you a three-day notice, and then you—you followed it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: So you lived out the one month that you paid, and this is all about the security deposit now?\n\nJudge: What was the problem? Why did he get a three-day notice in his first month?\n\nDefendant: He was sharing the apartment with someone else.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And his roommate said that he tried to move someone into the apartment.\n\nJudge: Wait, what? The roommate told you that he—\n\nDefendant: —that the plaintiff tried to move someone else in, yeah. And he was not comfortable with it.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: So I said, before it escalates, I will ask him to leave.\n\nJudge: So you asked him to leave. And, much to your surprise, he left?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nDefendant: I’m not surprised. I’m surprised because most times that you file a three-day notice, they go—they put it as a doily under—at least those are the cases I see—under their beard.\n\nJudge: All right. So he leaves, and then the other guy stays?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And was the other guy on the lease?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So he just paid the rent?\n\nDefendant: Yes, entirely.\n\nJudge: Did he move some—did he get another roommate or anything?\n\nDefendant: Yes, he got another roommate, which is—I’m very happy with them. I have no problems.\n\nJudge: And does your lease actually say no overnight guests unless you contact me?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And why is that in there? That’s a little unusual.\n\nDefendant: Because a lot of times, people say, “Okay, I’m having an overnight guest.” And the guest stays until a month, two months. And then they’re not leaving because they have squatters’ rights. And I didn’t want that to happen.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: You kept $350 of his security deposit because he was supposed to return the key?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I gave him five business days to return the key. He didn’t return the key, so I had to get a locksmith to change the lock.\n\nJudge: Did you send him a letter or something?\n\nDefendant: Yes, he got an email from my son, who was my property manager.\n\nJudge: May I see the email?\n\nDefendant: Let me see if I have that copy.\n\nJudge: Did you get an email from her son saying, “Return the key”?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Well, why did you take the key with you to begin with?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought I was going to give it to somebody, and I—\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you give it to your roommate?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t think to do that.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, then she had to change the locks.\n\n(Discussion continues regarding texts from the defendant’s son, locksmith receipts, and final verdict.)\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, but my verdict in this case is for the defendant.

{"id": "713", "dialogue": "Okay, neighbors—so, Kenneth Coburn, you are suing Kenny Pullman and Brianna Pullman for $1,439.27 that you are out because, according to you, Brianna backed into your car. All right, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a snowy morning, January 8th. The defendant came out of her house, and they have a circular driveway. I was having my driveway plowed at that time, and I was shoveling the walkway when she came out. I was yelling to her, \"Watch out for my car,\" because I had moved my car out to the street for the plow to plow my driveway.\n\nObviously, she did not hear me. She had earplugs in her ear; she did not hear me. She backed into my car.\n\nJudge: Okay, but where was your car in relation to this? Here, we have an actual picture. That’s your circular driveway? Your home?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, come on over here where the picture is. Tell me where your car was.\n\nPlaintiff: Over here, more across the street.\n\nJudge: You were parked in front of your house, and then she comes out—\n\nDefendant (Brianna Pullman): Circle, circle—you know what car I hit? My dad’s. Because I’m like, \"What’s your car doing there?\"\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happened? You backed out, and how hard did you hit it?\n\nDefendant (Brianna Pullman): Literally not even 2 to 5 miles an hour, possibly. Our driveway isn’t—\n\nJudge: Did you notice you hit it?\n\nDefendant (Brianna Pullman): Right away. I heard it. I pulled right off of it. I did not hear him yelling. I had nothing in my ears. I was just driving my brother to his friend’s house, and yeah, I hit it. And I got out and looked at it, and he was out there.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead. You can go back; you don’t have to stand.\n\nJudge: So, you talked to her, and that conversation—that’s not exactly what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: No. After she hit my car, she got out. I said to her, \"You hit my car.\" She said, \"I know, I got to go.\" I said, \"You have to get out and look at the damage.\" She said her father would take care of it. At that same time, as she was pulling away, her father was walking out of the house.\n\nHer father and I came over to my driveway and looked at the damage because I had pulled my car into my driveway. Her father and I looked at the damage. He acknowledged the damage too. He said his father-in-law owns a body shop, that they would take care of it. That was in January.\n\nI have a tax practice, so between January and April, I’m extremely busy. So about the second week of April, I saw—I’m not sure if it was his wife, his fiancée, or his girlfriend—I’m not sure. I went over to her and said, \"I’m a little embarrassed coming over and asking about this. If this was my son that hit your car, I would have come over and given you a check the next day.\"\n\nShe acknowledged it.\n\nJudge: How would they know how much it is?\n\nPlaintiff: They already had the estimate.\n\nJudge: That’s a part you skipped. When did you get an estimate?\n\nPlaintiff: I think January 21st.\n\nJudge: And you had left the estimate where? In their mailbox?\n\nPlaintiff: I handed it to him.\n\nJudge: You handed it to him?\n\nPlaintiff: So he had it. He had it. And then all those months pass, and then you come back in April and say, \"Hey, what’s the deal?\" And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: The female said, \"We’re not those type of people. We’ll take care of it.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I waited another two weeks. Nothing happens. I saw Ken in the driveway, and I went over to him. I said, \"What are we doing here?\"\n\nHe got all frustrated and said, \"I’m redoing my whole house here. I have no time to talk about this now.\" And I looked at him and said, \"Okay, that doesn’t make sense.\" So I walked away.\n\nI waited another week. I then went and saw the female again and said, \"Listen, I’m not sure what we’re doing here, but I’m going to wait another week. If I don’t have this resolved, I’m going to call the police to get a police report so I can go through insurance.\"\n\nThen he came over, screaming in my car, stuck his head in my car, screaming, \"How dare you threaten to call the police?\"\n\nI said, \"Step back. Get out of my car. Get back. Step back from me.\"\n\nJudge: Oh, here we go. The peacocks are opening their little tail feathers, strutting the scene. Who’s the bigger peacock? Is that what’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff: So anyway, he started using language that we’ll leave out, and he said, \"We’re not paying for it.\"\n\nI said, \"Fine. I’ll go through insurance.\"\n\nSo I went through the insurance. I had to find out—he wouldn’t give me any information. I had to find out which insurance company they had. It ends up being the same insurance company as mine—State Farm.\n\nThey called him up, and they interviewed him, and he denied any knowledge of the accident, which was surprising to me. He’s saying something differently, but he denied it on the phone to insurance, saying he had no knowledge of the accident.\n\nBottom line: he hit my car. I just want my car fixed.    Judge: Okay. Now, let me hear from you. What happened?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): That morning, I was inside with my fiancée, and she came in and said, \"Dad, I just hit the neighbor’s car.\" So, I walk outside, and the plaintiff is out there. We both go over to the car, and I’m expecting to see some damage. I look, and I say, \"What are we looking at?\" He points to a spot on the car, and I swear to you, it was a scratch, the size of a nail head.\n\nJudge: Did you see it?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): I did. I actually had to put my face next to the car because I didn’t see it at first. I said, \"Oh, that’s what you’re talking about?\" And he said, \"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\nI said, \"Look, my father-in-law has a body shop. We can buff it out.\" He goes, \"Okay, but she should be more careful.\" I agreed, and that was the end of that conversation.\n\nThen, months later, I get a bill in the mail for almost $1,500, and I’m thinking, \"For what?\" I go over to the car, and the scratch isn’t even there anymore. Either he buffed it out himself or it just wasn’t visible. And now, I’m supposed to pay $1,500 for something that doesn’t exist anymore? That doesn’t make sense.\n\nJudge: Did you deny the accident to your insurance company?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): No, I told them what happened. But I told them it was minor and didn’t warrant a claim. I didn’t want my insurance to go up for something so small.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say you had no knowledge of the accident?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): No, I said I knew about it but didn’t agree with the cost.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s not true. I was on the phone with State Farm. They told me he denied any knowledge of the accident.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): That’s not what I said. I said I wasn’t responsible for that kind of money for a scratch.\n\nJudge: Hold on. I have the estimate here. It’s not just a buff-out job. There’s a dent.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): Where?\n\nJudge: Right here in the estimate. It says \"rear passenger side quarter panel dent repair and repaint.\"\n\nDefendant (Brianna Pullman): I swear, when I looked at it, it was just a little scratch.\n\nPlaintiff: It’s not a scratch. It’s a dent.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you this—why did it take you until April to follow up?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I was in tax season.\n\nJudge: And you expected him to just wait?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I expected them to do what they said they would. They acknowledged the damage, so I assumed they would take care of it.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you, Mr. Pullman—if this had been your car, and someone had backed into it, wouldn’t you expect them to fix it?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): Yes, but if it were that tiny, I wouldn’t have asked for $1,500. I would’ve buffed it out myself.\n\nJudge: But it’s not just a buff-out job, according to the estimate.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): I don’t trust the estimate.\n\nJudge: Did you get your own estimate?\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): No, because I didn’t think it was necessary.\n\nJudge: That’s where you made your mistake. If you thought his estimate was inflated, you should have gotten your own.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): I didn’t think it needed fixing!\n\nJudge: Well, the law says otherwise. If your daughter hit his car, and there’s verifiable damage, you’re responsible for fixing it.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): But—\n\nJudge: No buts. You had the chance to negotiate or get your own estimate, and you didn’t.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you.\n\nJudge: I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the full $1,439.27.\n\nDefendant (Kenny Pullman): That’s ridiculous.\n\nJudge: That’s the law.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I was at a farm in East for about 12 years. I’ve owned horses for most of my life and have never had issues before. The farm where I was boarding was investigated for compliance issues with shelters and horse care.\n\nJudge: Were your horses affected by that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, my horses were well taken care of at that farm.\n\nJudge: Then why did you move them?\n\nPlaintiff: There was a rumor that if the farm was shut down, the state could seize all the horses present on the property.\n\nJudge: So, you moved them to John’s farm out of precaution?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you move one horse or both?\n\nPlaintiff: I rode one horse over, but I boarded both within a few days.\n\nJudge: What was the payment agreement?\n\nPlaintiff: I initially agreed to pay $1,100 per month for both horses.\n\nJudge: For how long did you pay that?\n\nPlaintiff: Two months. Then, I negotiated a lower price of $850, which John accepted.\n\nJudge: How long did you board your horses there?\n\nPlaintiff: From January 28th through September 9th.\n\nJudge: How often did you visit?\n\nPlaintiff: On weekends only.\n\nJudge: Did you notice any issues with the horses while visiting?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I had repeated confrontations with John and different barn managers. I told him my horses weren’t getting enough water, adequate feed, or quality hay. He always assured me he’d fix it, so I trusted him.\n\nJudge: When you saw them the following week, did they appear malnourished?\n\nPlaintiff: I could see their weight fluctuating.\n\nJudge: Did they lose weight consistently from January to September?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then why did you leave them there for nine months?\n\nPlaintiff: They weren’t severely underweight at first. When Megan, a western rider managing the barn, was there, my horses were well cared for. She rode them and fed them properly.\n\nJudge: When did Megan leave?\n\nPlaintiff: End of May or early June.\n\nJudge: So, from June to September, your horses were losing weight?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you remove them sooner?\n\nPlaintiff: I wasn’t fully aware of how bad it had gotten until I took one to a horse show. People in the horse community came up to me, shocked at how thin my horse looked.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t notice before then?\n\nPlaintiff: Compared to the other horses at John’s farm, mine didn’t seem as bad. But at the show, I realized how underweight they were.\n\nJudge: What did you do next?\n\nPlaintiff: I confronted John and removed my horses.\n\nJudge: Did he refund you for the last month?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you’re suing for the entire nine months’ worth of boarding fees?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, including the time Megan was there.\n\nJudge: John, were the horses being adequately fed?\n\nDefendant (John): Yes, Your Honor. We followed the feeding instructions provided by Bettyanne.\n\nJudge: Do you have records of what was fed?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I have an affidavit from Jane Lyman, the only person who mixed the grain. She couldn’t be here today because her husband recently passed away.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry to hear that. What does the affidavit say?\n\nDefendant: It states that the horses were given fresh hay three times a day and that in June, Jane recommended increasing their grain, which Bettyanne agreed to.\n\nJudge: Bettyanne, did Jane ever approach you about increasing the grain?\n\nPlaintiff: No, that never happened.\n\nJudge: Jane says you agreed to it.\n\nPlaintiff: I only spoke to John about feed, and I was often in tears because he kept blaming his staff.\n\nJudge: John, did Bettyanne repeatedly complain to you about the feeding?\n\nDefendant: No, not until September when she confronted me after the horse show.\n\nJudge: Bettyanne says she brought it up multiple times over nine months.\n\nDefendant: That’s not true.\n\nJudge: The issue here is that you were fine paying rent for nine months, then took the horses to a show, got questioned about their condition, and only then decided they were too thin.\n\nPlaintiff: No, I repeatedly expressed concerns.\n\nJudge: Do you have vet records?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, from both before and after moving them.\n\nJudge: What do the records say?\n\nPlaintiff: My vet saw them in the spring while they were at John’s farm and again in the fall after I moved them. He noted mild weight loss.\n\nJudge: That’s not severe malnourishment.\n\nPlaintiff: But my vet saw them four weeks after they had already been moved and started recovering.\n\nJudge: Did you take them to a vet immediately after removal?\n\nPlaintiff: I called right away.\n\nJudge: Do you have medical evidence proving significant malnourishment?\n\nPlaintiff: I have emails recommending increased feeding.\n\nJudge: Emails aren’t enough. You’re claiming $7,200 in damages because you believe your horses were mistreated to the point you shouldn’t have had to pay board. But I need concrete proof.\n\nPlaintiff: I have photos.\n\nJudge: Let me see them.\n\n(Photos are reviewed.)\n\nJudge: These show weight loss, but I still don’t see evidence justifying full reimbursement. You visited every weekend, rode the horses, and didn’t take drastic action until September.\n\nPlaintiff: I trusted John when he said he would fix the issues.\n\nJudge: But you’re the one who waited nine months before taking serious action. Your vet only noted mild weight loss, and you were still actively showing the horse.\n\nPlaintiff: But—\n\nJudge: My ruling is for the defendant.

{"id": "123", "dialogue": "Judge: Michael Sanchez, you are suing Lucas Ornelas and Mr. Tech—that is correct? That's the name of the store?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Represented here by Lucas Ornelas. You're the owner, right?\n\nDefendant: That is correct.\n\nJudge: Alright. You’re suing for $5,727.22 in damages that you say you sustained when your laptop was stolen from his place. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, Your Honor. On the date of July 22nd, 2011, I called Mr. Ornelas to ask him about repairing my MacBook Pro screen. The screen had been broken, and if I could for a moment indicate to you where in the computer it was broken—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: The filaments that control the entire screen are in this area right here, and when the computer fell, it cracked the contact point. So what happens is, the computer screen went entirely dead.\n\nJudge: An entirely dead screen. Alright. So you go to him. Have you ever done business with him before?\n\nPlaintiff: I have, as a matter of fact, and he’s always been good as far as service.\n\nJudge: So you go there, and you quote to him it'll cost how much?\n\nDefendant: $300.\n\nJudge: And what were you going to do for the $300?\n\nDefendant: Replace the entire screen with a brand-new one.\n\nJudge: Okay. Who do you get the piece from? Apple, I guess, right?\n\nDefendant: Actually, if you go through Apple, it’s probably three times more, so I have people who can get me the parts.\n\nJudge: What, off a stolen truck?\n\nDefendant: No! I mean—Apple is just Apple.\n\nJudge: What does that mean?\n\nDefendant: No, they go to the manufacturer directly instead of going through Apple.\n\nJudge: So you go through the company that makes them. They just won’t have a little Apple logo on the back?\n\nDefendant: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Okay. Yeah, I’m fine with that. So it’s $300. That’s how much the repair was going to be. You gave him how much?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him a cash deposit of $50.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, approximately a week later, I called him just to see how progress was going on the machine. This was on a Wednesday that I called him. I got no return call. I called him again on Thursday. I got no call back. So I happened to see on Friday, I was passing by where his shop was, and his shop was open. He was there. So I walked in, and Mr. Ornelas had a somewhat—oh—kind of wincing pain on his face. More like somebody about to give you some bad news. Because as soon as I saw his expression, I went, \"Uh-oh\" to myself. And so I’m wondering what exactly had gone wrong.\n\nDefendant: What happened was, I have a storage room in the back. I have the showroom in the front, and then I do repairs in the back. It was a hot day, and my air conditioning wasn’t working correctly, so sometimes I kind of leave the door open in the back. But I’ll put something there so that if somebody tries to get in, they’ll trip over it and make some noise.\n\nJudge: You don’t have a security system?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Try that in your house. See what happens.\n\nDefendant: The way it’s set up is, I actually have a gate in the back that’s locked. So whoever needs to come in has to jump over that gate.\n\nJudge: You severely underestimated the resourcefulness of the average burglar. You figured, \"They're too loud. I gotta jump a fence. Then I gotta trip over some stuff. Ah, forget it—I don’t really want that computer.\"\n\nDefendant: I mean, I’ve done this for many years, and that’s pretty much, you know, if it gets warm, then I’ll open the door.\n\nJudge: Just fix the AC.\n\nDefendant: Yeah. So—\n\nJudge: What happened when you left that night? You forgot to lock the door?\n\nDefendant: No, it didn’t happen overnight. It happened during the daytime.\n\nJudge: Oh!\n\nDefendant: Yeah, I actually have a copy of the police report.\n\nJudge: You realized it the next day?\n\nDefendant: Yes. The next morning when I came in is when I noticed things were moved around.\n\nJudge: How much stuff was taken?\n\nDefendant: Just his laptop.\n\nJudge: Why just his laptop?\n\nDefendant: I know it seems kind of weird, and I kind of know what happened. I knew who it was.\n\nJudge: Who?\n\nDefendant: A high school student who was coming to my shop.\n\nJudge: Why do you think that person wanted his laptop?\n\nDefendant: Because he loved Apple products, and he was always looking at them.\n\nJudge: Was that the only Apple product you had at the time?\n\nDefendant: It was the newest one.\n\nJudge: So you think it was one of your employees?\n\nDefendant: Not an employee—an apprentice from a high school.\n\nJudge: Oh, so you were letting a high school student come in and just hang out?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, he was learning about computers.\n\nJudge: Did you report him to the police?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nDefendant: The police spoke with him, and they also spoke with his parents, but there was no proof that he took it.\n\nJudge: So nothing happened.\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Alright. Now, let me go back to you. What happens when you find out your computer is stolen?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, when Mr. Ornelas told me what had happened, naturally I was upset. I mean, I rely on this machine for my livelihood. I'm a DJ, and this machine has all my music, all my mixes, all my files. So I asked him, \"Well, what are you going to do about this?\" And at first, he told me he was going to replace the machine. So I said, \"Okay, let's see how that plays out.\"\n\nJudge: Did he offer you a replacement?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nPlaintiff: He offered me an older model, which was not the same as mine.\n\nJudge: Was it a comparable model?\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor. Mine was a 2011 MacBook Pro, and he offered me a 2009 model with lower specifications.\n\nJudge: Mr. Ornelas, was it the same or not?\n\nDefendant: It was the closest I could get at the time.\n\nJudge: That’s not what I asked. Was it the same model, same year, and same specifications?\n\nDefendant: No, it was an older model, but I thought it was fair.\n\nJudge: Did you explain that to him?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but he wasn’t happy with it.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, not only was I not happy with it, but I had already looked up the cost to replace my laptop, and it was significantly higher than what he was offering.\n\nJudge: Did you provide him with an estimate?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I printed out the cost from Apple’s website, which showed that to replace my exact model, it would be $2,500.\n\nJudge: Do you have that with you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do. Here you go.\n\nJudge: (Examines the paper) Okay. So, Mr. Ornelas, did you ever offer to pay him for the value of his lost laptop?\n\nDefendant: I offered to give him what I could afford. I’m a small business. I couldn’t just go out and buy a brand-new MacBook Pro.\n\nJudge: I understand that, but the law says you are responsible for items left in your care. Did you have any insurance?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So if you have no insurance and you’re responsible, what’s your plan?\n\nDefendant: I offered him a replacement.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, the replacement was not even close. It didn’t have the same specs, and it wouldn’t work for my needs as a DJ.\n\nJudge: Mr. Ornelas, you are responsible for the full replacement value of the laptop. That’s just how this works.\n\nDefendant: But Your Honor—\n\nJudge: No \"but.\" He left his laptop with you in good faith. You were negligent in securing your store. It got stolen, and now you have to replace it.\n\nDefendant: I don’t have that kind of money.\n\nJudge: Then you shouldn’t be in business without proper security measures.\n\nDefendant: (Sighs)\n\nJudge: Alright. Now, Mr. Sanchez, how do we get to $5,727.22?\n\nPlaintiff: The cost of the laptop is $2,500. Then there is the cost of the software, which was another $1,200. I had Serato DJ software, music production software, and some custom programs that I purchased over time. Then, I had about $1,500 worth of music files that I had purchased legally.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of purchase for the software and music?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I printed out my receipts from my email.\n\nJudge: (Reviews documents) Okay, these look legitimate.\n\nDefendant: But I can’t be responsible for his software and music! That wasn’t my fault!\n\nJudge: You are responsible for the laptop and everything that was inside of it. If someone leaves a car with a valet, and the valet loses the car, they don’t just owe for the car—they owe for what was in it, too.   Defendant: This is going to bankrupt me.\n\nJudge: Maybe this is a lesson in proper security. My ruling is for the plaintiff in the amount of $5,727.22.

{"id": "195", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: The Plaintiff says the Defendant ruined his hot tub cover by using it as a bench, but the Defendant says not guilty. It's the case of \"Undercovered.\" Thank you, Douglas. William Taylor?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: You are suing your former tenant, Lori Phillips, for $425.00, the amount you say she owes you to replace a hot tub cover that, according to you, she broke. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, last summer, from about May to August 2011, Lori rented a bedroom from me in my house. We have a hot tub in the rear and also a swimming pool. She utilized both of these; that wasn’t an issue at all. The issue was how she used the hot tub.\n\nJudge: How many people lived in the place?\n\nPlaintiff: Around five altogether. Myself and four other roommates. It’s a five-bedroom split-level, kind of a Brady Bunch-style split-level. Right around the middle of August, I saw her coming out of the pool, going to the hot tub on the other deck, and lifting the cover over. So now we have it halfway over like that, covering half the hot tub. Then she proceeded to get in it.\n\nJudge: And you questioned her about this?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I saw her at least on one occasion doing this and asked, \"What are you doing?\" She said, \"Oh, I'm just getting warmed up because the pool is too cold.\" I said, \"Oh, okay, well, as long as you don’t get trapped underneath it.\" That was all I cared about.\n\nPlaintiff: One other time, when I was mowing the lawn, I saw her utilizing the hot tub that way again. On the edge, where she had the cover folded over, and on the outer reinforced side of the hot tub, she would push herself up out of the hot tub in that manner.\n\nPlaintiff: On another occasion, shortly before she moved out, my girlfriend Angela, who is also my roommate, noticed Lori sitting on it—\n\nJudge: Is Angela here to testify?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I have a notarized statement from her.\n\nJudge: Why isn’t she here?\n\nPlaintiff: She’s afraid of flying.\n\nJudge: So she left you hanging?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, they all did.\n\nJudge: Wow. Okay, continue.\n\nPlaintiff: Angela informed me of seeing that also. At that time, I didn’t think much of it. But when closing the cover—\n\nJudge: When did you discover the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: Shortly after she moved out.\n\nJudge: Did you return a security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: There was no security deposit.\n\nJudge: How long after she moved out did you notice the problem?\n\nPlaintiff: About six weeks.\n\nJudge: And after six weeks, you then tell her the hot tub cover is damaged?\n\nDefendant: He accused me of something else first. He came after me for not giving a 30-day notice before moving out.\n\nJudge: And did you?\n\nDefendant: No, I gave two weeks’ notice.\n\nJudge: And what were you supposed to give?\n\nDefendant: 30 days. I was guilty of that.\n\nJudge: So you paid the rest of the rent because you felt you owed it?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And after paying, that’s the first time he mentions you ruined his hot tub cover?\n\nDefendant: Yes, in April. That was six months later. I got a letter at work.\n\nJudge: When did she move out?\n\nPlaintiff: Third week of August.\n\nJudge: Why did you wait four months to bring it up?\n\nPlaintiff: When she made her last payment in December, I told her about the cover and said I would try to repair it.\n\nJudge: Did you ever try to repair it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. When I opened it, I saw more damage.\n\nJudge: Did you get a professional opinion?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of the cover’s age and depreciation?\n\nPlaintiff: No, but it’s two years old, with a 10-year lifespan.\n\nJudge: Proof?\n\nPlaintiff: I have a warranty for the replacement one.\n\nJudge: That’s not proof for this one. Ms. Phillips, did you ever lean on the hot tub cover?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you use it half-flapped?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but I entered on the other side.\n\nJudge: Did you sit on it?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Does the hot tub have steps?\n\nPlaintiff: No, just low seats.\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the Defendant.

{"id": "134", "dialogue": "Judge: Ms. Katherine David, you are suing Dorene Kho for $415 that you are out as a result of what you say was a sick puppy that she sold you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Katherine David): That is correct. On January 15, 2017, I answered an ad in The Long Island Newsday for golden retrievers. I contacted the phone number, which turned out to be Dorene Kho. I made arrangements with her after speaking with her on the phone to visit the puppies. I visited them that day, and I was very happy with the puppy I saw—or rather, the puppies I saw. We discussed adoption, and I left a $200 deposit because the puppy was not ready to come home yet.\n\nI waited the recommended period of eight weeks to pick up the puppy, which I did on February 18. I gave her the remaining amount of $600.\n\nJudge: So the total purchase price was $1,800, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Is this your first golden retriever?\n\nPlaintiff: No, this is my third golden retriever. I’ve had two prior golden retrievers, which I also adopted through Newsday, and I felt very confident applying to this ad.\n\nJudge: So you bring the puppy home, and what happens? What day do you bring the puppy home?\n\nPlaintiff: I brought the puppy home on a Saturday, which was February—\n\nJudge: February what?\n\nPlaintiff: February 18, which was a long weekend. I made arrangements for the dog to see my vet on Monday, February 20. The dog went to my vet on February 20, was examined, and I left a fecal sample with the vet to be tested.\n\nI was informed the following day that the sample showed the dog had Giardia and Coccidia, which are parasites.\n\nJudge: Was the dog showing any symptoms?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she was, as a matter of fact.\n\nJudge: What symptoms?\n\nPlaintiff: She was showing a lack of appetite and having very loose, watery stools—consistently. In and out of the house, which is normal with a puppy, but the fact that she wasn’t eating, and just that something didn’t seem right, made me worried. That’s not what a puppy should be doing at this early stage.\n\nJudge: So you bring the dog back to the vet?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what does the vet do?\n\nPlaintiff: The vet prescribes an antibiotic for five days, with a recheck thereafter, along with another fecal sample to make sure the parasite is gone.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: The dog did not respond to the medications, so I had to go back to the vet again.\n\nJudge: Did you go back five days later, or before that?\n\nPlaintiff: I went back five days later.\n\nJudge: That was your checkup time?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: The same thing. Loose stools, not eating. The vet then gave the dog an antibiotic injection to try to help. He also suggested I change her diet to a prescription diet.\n\nJudge: And did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Did it help?\n\nPlaintiff: No, to no avail. The dog continued with the same symptoms.\n\nJudge: So then you took the dog to a veterinary neurology specialist?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: They gave her intravenous fluids to sustain her while she was there. She had several seizures.\n\nJudge: What did the specialist tell you?\n\nPlaintiff: Dr. Bilderbank called me and told me what they had observed overnight. She said the seizures were something the puppy was not going to recover from. The dog was walking in circles, drooling at the mouth, and was not responsive.\n\nShe said they could do further testing, but even if I had a Black American Express card, she could not guarantee that the results would provide a solution.\n\nJudge: So the puppy was put down?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you notify the defendant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, two days before. I called her the morning the specialist told me about the condition and asked if she wanted the puppy back.\n\nJudge: And what did she say?\n\nPlaintiff: She said, “Do not bring that dog here.”\n\nJudge: Ms. Kho, let me talk to you. How long have you been breeding dogs?\n\nDefendant (Dorene Kho): Approximately 40 years.\n\nJudge: Wow, that is a long time.\n\nDefendant: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: When you first heard about the issue, what did you do?\n\nDefendant: I was in shock. This was an amazing litter—\n\nJudge: How many puppies were in the litter?\n\nDefendant: Seven.\n\nJudge: Did any of the other dogs have issues?\n\nDefendant: Her neighbor owns the brother of the puppy that passed.\n\nJudge: Did that dog have issues?\n\nDefendant: That dog also had Giardia, but it survived.\n\nJudge: Did another puppy from the litter die?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I kept one of the puppies, and she passed away at my home.\n\nJudge: So two from the litter had issues?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then what’s your defense?\n\nDefendant: I had no idea this would happen. I sent the puppy to Cornell University for a necropsy, and they confirmed it was a virus.\n\nJudge: The law is clear. If the animal is unfit for purchase at the time of sale, the breeder is responsible for reimbursement.\n\nJudge: I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of $3,600.\n\n[Gavel bangs]\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, deflection, persuasion"}

Alright, mate1.com.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, I called him. Does it have some kind of specialty that… you know, I’ve never heard of that one actually. I work a lot, so I don’t get time to socialize. I’ve heard of dating sites, girl, I think the whole thing’s very efficient. I mean, I’ve been married for 20 years, but if I wasn’t, that’s how I would… it’s like internet shopping, it’s fine. But, um, I have a question for you though. Does it… it’s just anybody can be on it? Do you have to meet certain criteria to be on it?\n\nPlaintiff: You do.\n\nJudge: Yes. What's the criteria?\n\nPlaintiff: A life.\n\nJudge: Yes, alright. So, you meet him on what day?\n\nPlaintiff: Valentine's Day.\n\nJudge: Yes, we did. We met that Friday, we went out, we discussed what we wanted out of our life. He was real straightforward and honest, and I loved that about him. So, it was like a flick at first sight. Then he was telling me about his plans, his dreams and his aspirations. I really liked that because he was like so honest doing that, and I supported him right off the bat.\n\nJudge: So, at some point, what? You supported him right off the bat? What does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff: You liked him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I liked him.\n\nJudge: Or did you mean actually financially supported him?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t know what you were saying.\n\nJudge: Okay, that's alright.

Okay, do you have children?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: Okay, we got that going, right. So, because half the time when that happens, I have people moving their children into somebody who could be a pedophile, not to suggest that about you, but you know…\n\nPlaintiff: Alright, so you at least it’s only you who you were putting at risk. So, you move in. How many weeks had you known him when you moved in?\n\nPlaintiff: I think about 3 weeks, two and a half, 3 weeks.\n\nJudge: Oh, you know all about a man by then?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Right, in 3 weeks you’re going to know everything there is to know. Yeah, how’d that work out for you?\n\nPlaintiff: It was actually good for the first month, everything was alright, we understood each other, we talked about what and then after a month, it wasn’t so good.\n\nJudge: Right, because it didn’t work out too well for you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, wait and get to know somebody before you moved in with them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, have you done that before?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it was actually my first time. I realized I was getting old and I really needed to have a relationship.\n\nJudge: And that’s fine and I understand that, alright. I understand the loneliness, but if you want… sometimes you got to think long term. And if what you want is a relationship long term, then you want to get to know someone before you turn around and uproot your life, because it usually doesn’t work when it’s like this. You know, you have to invest a little time in a relationship that’s long-lasting, and if you can’t wait 3 weeks before you move in with somebody you don’t know each other, you’re going to fight non-stop and it’s going to turn out that you two maybe aren’t compatible to live with each other, which is in fact what you found out, because when you moved in, you two started fighting. And what are you fighting about?\n\nPlaintiff: My job, my hours, that hour.\n\nJudge: What do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Actually, I’m a sales rep and I’m a nursing assistant.\n\nJudge: And you were working how many hours a day?\n\nPlaintiff: Depending how I feel, I work like 14.\n\nJudge: And how long was he working a day?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, he’s not working.\n\nJudge: You don’t?\n\nDefendant: Okay, alright, so you were lonely?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You were still lonely?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You moved the woman in, ma’am, you think your loneliness is over and then you're still lonely?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Right, exactly. Exactly right, of course, if you knew her a little bit beforehand you’d say, well, maybe this isn’t the woman for me because we’re not compatible in that respect. And why aren’t you working?\n\nDefendant: I’m retired. I’m a military veteran, PTSD.\n\nJudge: Okay, you're going through some psychological issues?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You’ve handed me a report by a psychiatrist?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: According to the report, you're suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And dissociative disorder?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: How long has it been? Where did you serve?\n\nDefendant: I was on the USS Saratoga in 1986 when we bombed Libya and we had the hostages off of the… I mean, the kidnappers that kidnapped their cu’s, Lao, the big and they pushed the man off the… we got that, that was our F14s that made that 747 night, president.\n\nJudge: What was your role?\n\nDefendant: I’m a fireman. I help the jets take off.\n\nJudge: Right. Okay, thank you for your service.\n\nDefendant: Thank you, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And I’m sorry that you're going through difficulty. All the more reason why you might want to know somebody before they move in. That’s when you break up. Whose idea was it?\n\nDefendant: I take it, it was yours.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it was.\n\nJudge: Then when you leave, why do you leave stuff behind?\n\nPlaintiff: Actually, I found the apartment and I came back the next day to get my stuff, and he didn’t want to let me in the apartment, he changed the locks, because you know, I was going to leave because I told…\n\nPlaintiff: But you had taken some stuff, you hadn't taken anything?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really, only what I needed for the day. I didn’t take anything.\n\nPlaintiff: So you needed your stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: So, I went over there in a cab. I went upstairs and knocked on his door. He didn’t want to let me in, and I said, “Okay, then put them outside. Pack up as much stuff as you can and put them outside.”\n\nJudge: You're just shouting through the door?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How are you communicating with him on the phone or no?\n\nPlaintiff: I was talking through the door because he closed the door, he didn’t want to let me in.\n\nJudge: Alright, and what does he say?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I’ll pack it and put it out.\n\nJudge: Yes, and he opened the door and he has the video camera on me and says, “I should just take up the stuff and leave.”\n\nPlaintiff: So, I just took everything and I said, “There’s a lot more stuff I need.” I leave, and he says, “Just go, go.”\n\nJudge: Do you have that video?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma’am, I didn’t bring it because I don’t think we were…\n\nJudge: Was there stuff that you wouldn’t let her get?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: It’s not what happened.\n\nJudge: So, they move in a couple of weeks after meeting on a dating site. Is that ridiculous?\n\nDefendant: You know what, the way communication is nowadays, I believe it is possible. 20 years ago, I saw my wife in the hallway of our high school, and I fell in love with her, and I’m really touched.\n\nJudge: How soon later did you move in with her?\n\nDefendant: I would say after we found out she was pregnant.\n\nJudge: Okay, is it too long or ridiculous, a couple of weeks moving in?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, I think it’s too soon to move in. Let’s get a different perspective, what do you think?\n\nPlaintiff: I think it’s ridiculous, because you can actually… well, it can happen because people can meet each other and fall in love at first sight. Fair enough.\n\nJudge: When Harry Met Sally. Going inside the courtroom, I went out. I go to see the psychiatrist once a week. When I went to go see the psychiatrist, when I came back, she was gone. You can visibly tell that she took her stuff out of the closet, stuff out of the drawers, so that was the first inkling you got that she was leaving?\n\nDefendant: I was abandoned.\n\nDefendant: The first thing I felt was abandoned.\n\nJudge: Abandoned?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: So, I imploded, you know, it hurt because why would you leave like that? And so she wanted to call me back and talk it over. I didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t want to… if you left, you should have taken everything.\n\nJudge: Then what happened? What happened to the rest of her stuff that she didn’t take?\n\nDefendant: Oh, the garbage got it.\n\nJudge: The garbage got it?\n\nDefendant: Got it.\n\nJudge: How did the garbage get it?\n\nDefendant: Did it come in and put its hands inside of the stuff and make it suck it into the garbage?\n\nDefendant: You threw it out. I quickly put some stuff together and I videotaped, because I didn’t want her to say open the door and hit her or anything like that.\n\nJudge: So, whatever she got and didn’t want to call back and say she missed stuff?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: Probably.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what she says that you still had and refused to give her is a digital camera, a computer, six winter coats, two boots, six nursing uniforms, and some computer software. Let's talk about those. The digital camera and computer, did that stay behind?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. And why?\n\nPlaintiff: Ask her.\n\nDefendant: Okay, where is it now?\n\nDefendant: In my house.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you do and those things belong to her?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Who do they belong to?\n\nDefendant: We bought those while we were together, and she left it.\n\nJudge: Okay, you bought them while you were together and she left them. But who paid for them?\n\nDefendant: You're not working. She's working 14 hours.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you agree that she paid for them, but you feel like since it was during your time together… That’s the logic?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: That sounds a little unfair to me. But let’s keep going.\n\nJudge: How much are you asking for in total?\n\nPlaintiff: $1,556.16.\n\nJudge: Alright, what is that for?\n\nPlaintiff: The computer, the camera, and the clothes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and do you have the receipts for them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Well, based on the evidence in the case, I’m awarding you the amount that you have requested. You have won the case.\n\nJudge: The decision is in your favor.

I need to redo my porch, and I took him to my house and I told him, \"This is what I want to be done.\" And he gave me a contract.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd he gave me the contract. He said, um, when I start, bring um—okay, it’s $2,200.\n\nJudge:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo, you gave him how much of a deposit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI gave him $1,000. Later, I gave him another $700.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, because what did he do?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe did the porch.\n\nJudge:\nHe completed it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo. He just did the platform.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a picture of how he left it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let’s see that.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over pictures.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I have no idea what I’m looking at.

Go ahead and go back.\n\n(To the defendant) What’s going on?\n\nDefendant:\nThe reason why it took me so long to start the job was—he gave me a check, um, and then we had a really rainy season because it rained every Tuesday and Wednesday through March and April.\n\nJudge:\nCouldn’t you start the job on a different day than Tuesday or Wednesday?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, but—\n\nJudge:\nI’m going to need you to stand right in front of the mic so we can pick up your audio.\n\n(Defendant moves closer.)\n\nJudge:\nAll right.

I took everything to the dump.

You say he owes you because you rented your car to him. Tell me about it.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Basically, me and Tariq have been friends for some years. He was in a jam. I had two vehicles at the time, so I agreed to give him one of my vehicles if he agreed to pay the car note.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so you agreed to rent him your vehicle for how much a month?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The car note, which was $400 a month.\n\n**Judge:** $400 a month. And when did you agree to do that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t remember the specific date and month, but it was sometime—\n\n**Judge:** When did you start renting the car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I want to say April of 2016.\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, that sounds about right.\n\n**Judge:** So what is it you’re suing for?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I just wanted the ticket payments because that’s what’s affecting me today.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. How many tickets did you get on this car? First of all, you’re paying $400 a month, just for the car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I was paying $900, up to $900 a month.\n\n**Judge:** How? How long were you paying that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That was for the summer of—\n\n**Judge:** Wait, this is a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And you’re paying $900 a month?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** How is this a good deal for you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Bad credit. I didn’t have— I have terrible credit.\n\n**Judge:** Wow. Alright. So according to you, you paid $900 a month for how many months?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Three.\n\n**Judge:** And then what?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The first boot— the car got three boots in total. The first boot was not my fault. The second two boots were. And I did get—\n\n**Judge:** How was the first boot not your fault?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because they weren’t my tickets.\n\n**Judge:** Did you pay off all those tickets?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I paid them off.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And then what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The second boot, I paid off. I had some tickets. I didn’t pay them in time. It wasn’t as many. I paid them off. Third boot—\n\n**Judge:** So the boot comes off only when you pay everything you owe, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** So the third boot that you pay off is when?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t exactly— it was in 2017.\n\n**Judge:** Do you know when the boot was?\n\n**Defendant:** I believe it was February.\n\n**Judge:** So I know that at some point after that boot, any tickets that happen are going to be yours. And in fact, according to you, you had the car between what dates and what dates?\n\n**Defendant:** April 2016 to when?\n\n**Plaintiff:** To September 2017.\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah, September 2017.\n\n**Judge:** When the car got— was finally repossessed. Now, the car gets repossessed. And why is it repossessed?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because the car note wasn’t paid on time.\n\n**Judge:** How many times had he not paid the car note on time?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was a total of three months.\n\n**Judge:** And according to you, you were paying him on time and he just wasn’t giving the money to the bank?\n\n**Defendant:** I didn’t know. When the car got repossessed, I didn’t know I was behind. I was led to believe that everything was okay. We only had to worry about the insurance.\n\n**Judge:** I’m going to need you to prove to me that you were current. Can you do that?\n\n**Defendant:** The last transaction we made was in person. I have nothing on paper.\n\n**Judge:** According to you, the repo fee was $740. Did you get charged that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma’am. I paid the tow company $740.\n\n**Judge:** And do you have the car now?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I voluntarily surrendered it to the bank. But I didn’t want the repo on my credit, so—\n\n**Judge:** Okay. So you think he should pay the repo fee because—\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have proof here. This is him admitting that he didn’t pay the bill and lost his job.\n\n**Judge:** But I don’t understand why you’re allowing him to ruin your credit. Why are you allowing— how do you let it get months and months behind?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I was monitoring them, but the thing was, he didn’t make all the payments directly to the bank. Some of them came to me.\n\n**Judge:** No. All of them should come to you, and then you would know every single month whether he made the payment. Then you should be responsible for making sure that the payment gets to the bank because it’s your credit on the line. Do you understand?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Absolutely.\n\n[The case continues with the discussion of evidence and judgment, leading to a final ruling by the judge awarding $2,938 to the plaintiff.]\n\n**Judge:** Pay the man.\n\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, persuasion"}

What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: So basically what happened was I went in, was interested in the bike, I saw it, I sat on it, I put a deposit down even before talking about pricing or anything like that.\n\nJudge: Why would you do such a thing?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I was very new to this whole thing.\n\nJudge: What’s new to this whole thing?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, buying a bike.\n\nJudge: Or adulthood? How old are you?\n\nPlaintiff: I was 20 at the time. I’m 21 now, but I didn’t really know what the process was or anything. I just figured, yeah, I want to put a deposit down on this bike, I would like to take it.\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t get approved for the loan.\n\nJudge: You applied for a loan to purchase the bike?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: And you signed a sales contract for the bike?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: And then when it came time, they said I wasn’t approved for the loan.

But then I spoke it over with friends, family. It wasn’t the decision that I should have been making, so I decided not to do it.\n\nJudge: Which is probably smart. But now you want that to cost him and not you. And that’s the part I’m questioning you on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I mean—\n\nJudge: In other words, you want to be able to sign a contract, apply for a loan, buy a bike, and bail out of it when it turns out that you made a foolhardy move.

I mean, that’s not a custom bike, right? Like you were building it and he came back the next day.\n\nDefendant: It’s a stock bike, but we ordered it for him. It wasn’t in stock.\n\nJudge: It wasn’t in your stock? Did you order it from somewhere else?\n\nDefendant: From the motor company.\n\nJudge: Also, Mr. LaFaso neglected to tell you what he does for a living when he says he doesn’t know the procedure.\n\nPlaintiff: What do you do?\n\nDefendant: He’s a Honda car salesman.\n\nJudge: Get out of here!\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: No, stop.

But if the defendant doesn’t want to, will he?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Because?\n\nPlaintiff: Because the bike people, they just don’t want to give him the money.\n\nJudge: They don’t want to. But real quickly, does the bike person have to do it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he gave it to him already.\n\nJudge: He did give it to him already. That’s true.\n\nJudge: Let me see the contract.\n\nDefendant: Here.\n\nJudge: Special order, non-refundable, non-cancelable. What does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, before anything, if you notice, it’s handwritten. I never signed to that.\n\nJudge: I’m convinced. Here’s what I noticed: I notice it’s handwritten on the copy you handed me. So, no, this is his, and this is yours, and it’s there on your copy. So, I know that you left the place—\n\nPlaintiff: I never got that copy. That’s from the bank after I actually went to them and tried disputing the charge.\n\nJudge: You went to the bank? How could you dispute the charge?

{"id": "784", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says the defendant rented an apartment in his house and skipped out without paying all the rent, but the defendant says he paid in full. It’s the case of \"The Rent's Too Damn Inaccurate.\"\n\nJudge: Wayne Monsky, you are suing Michael Johnson for $1,794.42 in damages, unpaid rent, and other items that you say you were damaged when your tenant, Mr. Johnson, left abruptly without notice and without paying. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: His girlfriend, Pam, moved out at the end of July, beginning of August. I wouldn’t have known, other than I actually went there in the beginning of August when her uncle was moving her stuff out. I was there to bother Michael about mowing the lawn. We had an agreement for him to mow the lawn. Even though Pam moved out in July-August, she paid for most of the rent for August and September—$775 out of $800. The $25 was for the mowing of the lawn.\n\nJudge: So all of the rent? In other words, his rent was $775 because you gave him a $25 discount for mowing the lawn?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but he didn’t mow the lawn. That’s part of it. At the end of September, when the payments from Pam ran out, he called me and said he was moving out. At that time, I told him I was going to have to show the apartment, and he said, \"No way, you can’t show the apartment.\" We bickered about it, and he said, \"Only if I’m there, and you have to make arrangements through me.\"\n\nJudge: But that's exactly how you must show the apartment unless he agrees otherwise. The law gives you the right to do it, but you have to make arrangements with him and give him notice.\n\nPlaintiff: Throughout October, we tried multiple times to come to an agreement. He’d say, \"Oh, this date,\" and then at the last second, it would change. In the end, all I got was one day for less than two hours—October 25th.\n\nJudge: Did anyone show interest?\n\nPlaintiff: Two people looked, but the place was trashed because he was still moving out. No one was interested at that time. I had over two dozen people originally from the advertising.\n\nJudge: When did you put the advertisement in?\n\nPlaintiff: Right away at first, then another one in early October.\n\nJudge: You're suing for advertising costs. Do you have the advertising here?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: October wasn’t paid, and then, according to you, you weren’t able to rent it out for November because of his withholding permission to show the place. When did you rent it?\n\nPlaintiff: December 1st.\n\nJudge: Mr. Johnson, what’s going on?\n\nDefendant: Your honor, on January 29th, he was paid $1,054 from Pamela Heckley to close the case between both of us. He also kept an $800 security deposit for supposed damages.\n\nJudge: You were living there with your girlfriend. It didn’t work out?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She lived there until mid-August.\n\nJudge: So she moves out. Rent is paid until September?\n\nDefendant: Yes. Then October wasn’t paid. I moved out.\n\nJudge: When?\n\nDefendant: October 31st.\n\nJudge: According to him, he couldn’t rent it for November because you wouldn’t allow him to show the place. Respond to that.\n\nDefendant: I gave him two months' notice that I was moving out. I also gave him a month's notice that I wasn’t able to pay October's rent.\n\nJudge: But you’re saying, \"I hereby declare I have no intention of paying October?\"\n\nDefendant: But he was paid for that when Pam made the deal.\n\nJudge: We’ll talk about that. So, in October, how many times did he come to show the apartment?\n\nDefendant: Twice. Once I was there. The second time, I was not. He told me he was going in anyway.\n\nJudge: Were you present during the first showing?\n\nWitness (Pam): Yes. The place had boxes, but it wasn’t bad. Potential tenants could see past that.\n\nJudge: Did you overhear discussions between them?\n\nWitness: Yes. He asked to come when my boyfriend was at work, but Michael wanted to be there.\n\nJudge: The second time he said he was going in anyway, why didn’t you stop him?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t want to argue. I already told him I couldn’t pay rent.\n\nJudge: Did he send you a letter demanding money?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see it. This is different. This is a breakdown for Pamela’s mother. It includes rent, damages, advertising, court fees, and more.\n\nPlaintiff: Pamela covered the damages. Now I’m pursuing Michael for lost rent.\n\nJudge: You have an $800 security deposit, and Pamela sent $1,054. That’s more than what you’re suing for. Why are you not satisfied?\n\nPlaintiff: I was trying to keep Pam out of this, per their request. She didn’t pay rent, only damages.\n\nJudge: But you already received more than you’re suing for. You cannot collect twice. My verdict is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection"}

{"id": "542", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Iris Harris, yes, you are suing Luis Garcia and King County Realty Corporation. Luis Garcia, you're the owner, yes ma'am. All right, for $2,000 in return of a security deposit that you put down that you believe is owed back to you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Okay, um, I went into the Kings Realty company, and I was put in for, you know, they gave me a sign of the paper for an apartment, so I never heard anything from them. So I finally got a phone call, and I got a voicemail saying that they had an apartment, was I interested, and I was still looking. I said yes, so I called them, and I made the arrangements to come check the apartment. So I went and checked the apartment, and I liked it, and he asked me right then and there, \"What day was this?\"\n\nJudge: This is, I don't know the exact date.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): This is in April, mid-April, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so he said, \"Are you sure you can do this?\" I said, \"Yes, we can do this.\" I asked some different things about, you know, \"Did you sign a lease?\" Well, I signed the lease, yes ma'am, I did sign the lease. But the lease wasn't supposed to take effect until May 1st.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Well, yeah, but it's fine when you sign it.\n\nJudge: Yes, ma'am.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Okay, so I told him I called him the next day, and I said, \"You know, we were going to get the apartment, what did I need to do?\" And he said, \"Come down to the office, fill out some paperwork.\" During that time, I didn't sign a lease. It was no lease signing, it was just the paperwork for saying about the broker's fee, what it could be. Let me see that paperwork.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I didn't get a copy of that.\n\nJudge: Do you have that paperwork?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I don't know which form, she broker's fees.\n\nJudge: No, did you ever sign something that said anything about broker's fees?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yeah, may I see that?\n\nJudge: I don't have it because it wasn't in...\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I mean, but you're trying to keep the part of the money because of a broker's fee, right?\n\nJudge: Is your broker's fee something that was going to be paid by the landlord or by the plaintiff?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): By the plaintiff.\n\nJudge: Well, then how do you figure it's not going to be in question when we're in trial over the $2,000 that she says, \"I want it back,\" and you're saying no part of that's my broker's fee? What is in question, if not that? I need you to contact your office and have that faxed over.\n\n[Court is in recess]\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): So, like I said, there was the papers about the broker's fee and what it could be, you know, about.\n\nJudge: So, okay, you signed up for the apartment?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Yes, because you signed a lease, and the lease is signed on what day?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): May, April 23rd or 24th.\n\nJudge: Let me see your copy of the lease.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): And so I wasn't looking forward to paying anything that day, but he asked me, you know, for the $3,000, which was the security deposit as well as the broker's fee, and I told him I said, \"Well, I didn't have $3,000 on me. I had $2,000.\" I said, \"But let me call, 'cause my fiancé was coming, you know, to meet us up there for, you know, to meet.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Okay, I'm hold on one second. As it turns out, you were never able to get that other thousand, yes?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Right, 'cause like he said, my husband... he’s supposed to... my fiancé, he's supposed to, you know...\n\nJudge: Now he's your husband?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): He’s supposed to, you know, Western Union money because he had to go out of town. He had to take care of some business out of town. So he Western Unioned money, and he gave me the MTCN and all that logistics. I don’t know what happened between Western Union and him with that money. All I know, I never received it. So he’s going through some logistic with the Western Union 'cause I was earning that $1,000. So I called Mr. Garcia, and I said, \"Listen, I was in tears because I really wanted this place.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): \"I know, and I said, 'I'm sorry, I mean, when do you tell them I can't afford this apartment, and I can't...'\" This was that same Friday, the same Friday in the week that, you know, we... before. What day did you call him?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Sweetheart, um, I don’t know the exact day. This was between...\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): What day did she call you and tell you, \"I can't take the apartment\"?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): The day before May 1st, April 30th.\n\nJudge: Is that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): No, sir. No, ma’am. That’s right. It was not. It was not the day before.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): What day did you call?\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): This was the week before May 1st.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then you said, \"Can I have my $2,000 back?\"\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Yeah, I asked him, \"How do you figure like that you get the $2,000 back?\" Because it... on that paper, it said about the deposit, what I can... I can get my deposit back.\n\nJudge: Let me see that paper.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): There’s some... he has it. Does it say that the deposits were refundable?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I have blank ones.\n\nJudge: It does not say I want the blank one. I want the one in this case. Court isn’t recess. Go get it all. Rise.\n\n[Court is in recess]\n\nJudge: So if it doesn’t say anything about whether it’s refundable or not, does the plaintiff get her money back?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I think she should just... yeah, I think she should.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Because, uh, she didn’t actually get the apartment. She didn’t sign the lease. And, uh, maybe she should have to pay, like, a small fee for the time that the realtor spent.\n\nJudge: Okay, you're kind of backing off that a little bit. What do you think?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I think, yes, because she didn’t really... she didn’t sign it. She didn’t sign the lease, but she did commit to getting the apartment.\n\nJudge: You get the last word.\n\nPlaintiff (Iris Harris): Um, yeah, I think she should, 'cause it’s not fair 'cause she didn’t sign the lease. She didn’t sign the lease. That’s a big deal for everybody here.\n\nJudge: So, what ended up happening, you weren’t able to get the document with her signature on it?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): No.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Because I looked for it yesterday, and I couldn’t find it.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you say that before I took a recess? Why didn’t you tell me, “Judge, we’ve lost it,” instead of making me take a recess to give you a chance to bring something, and looking at me and saying, \"Well, that's not an issue?\" Why would you do that?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): I just took my valuable time out to give you a chance to bring something. I thought you made the judgment error not to bring it.\n\nJudge: Now it turns out that it was never... I didn’t have to waste this time anyway because you couldn’t find it yesterday. Why couldn’t you find it?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Somebody lost it.\n\nJudge: Wow. All right. Now, this is the document that you say you signed, that you say said refundable, printed or written. No. It says that the only thing on this says that’s nonrefundable is the $50 for the credit application and that the rest is refundable under what circumstances.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Well, I mean, that's what I’m saying. It didn’t say whether or not it was, you know, non-refundable or, you know, that they can keep it, the deposit.\n\nJudge: All right. You received $2,000 from her, and what happened?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Mr. Pearson had called me about a week later and said, \"Listen, I’m going to wire you the money.\" He says, \"I’m going to try to get you to hold $2,500.\" I said, \"Well, we need $3,000 right now to give it to the landlord, make him happy, 'cause I gave him $800.\" I have a receipt here where I gave the landlord the $800 when he came to sign his end of the lease.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): And then what happened to the other $1,200 of her money?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): The other $1,200 I kept for as part of the broker’s fee going forward.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): So then I’m waiting for the other deposit, the rest of the deposit, so that it would be a total of $3,000: $1,500 to the broker, $1,500 security. Then, when she’s ready to move in, I’ll give her the key, and she can send the other $1,500 directly to the landlord or pay me. I give the landlord however she wanted to work it out. The monthly rent is $1,500. Yes, the security is $1,500, and then the broker’s fee is how much? $1,500.\n\nJudge: So she was supposed to come up with $4,500?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yes.\n\nJudge: And you understood this to be $1,500 for the broker’s fee, $1,500 for the security deposit, and $1,500 for the rent?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on. So when she told me she wasn’t taking the apartment so late in the game, I called up the landlord and said, \"Listen, Miss Harris isn’t taking the apartment.\" He goes, \"Well, I can’t give her the money back. She tied up the apartment for almost half a month.\" I told Miss Harris that I would have to try to rerent the apartment to try to give her the fee back.\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): So after 2 weeks... I mean, the landlord had rented it. He’s calling up other agents, and somebody else rented it. I was like, \"I have six.\"\n\nJudge: Did you rerent it?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): No.\n\nJudge: When did it get rented?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Like the 14th of May or something like that.\n\nJudge: Did anybody from your realty company rent it?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yes.\n\nJudge: So then your realty company got the fee?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yes, for the month of May, the broker's fee.\n\nJudge: Do you think she has the right to get that deposit back?\n\nDefendant (Luis Garcia): Yes.\n\nJudge: Then I rule in your favor.

{"id": "535", "dialogue": "Judge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff brought his dog to the defendant groomer, and the groomer let the dog fall, breaking its leg. But the defendants say the dog is vicious and attacked, which caused the fall. It’s the case of putting himself.\n\nJudge: Jerry Rosenstein?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, on December 24th of last year, I felt Stella needed a grooming, so I took her to—\n\nJudge: What kind of dog is Stella?\n\nPlaintiff: Stella is a Cairn Terrier Schnauzer.\n\nJudge: Toto was a Cairn Terrier.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, I got Toto in the head.\n\nJudge: Got it. Okay. And so what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: At first, I realized that there was a change in management. I had been there before. The former manager wasn’t there, but I decided to leave her with the new people.\n\nJudge: Was it a change of ownership?\n\nPlaintiff: Change of ownership.\n\nJudge: Ownership. All right. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: When I went home, there was a call from Mrs. Gonzalez, and she said there had been an accident, and that Mr. Gonzalez had taken Stella to an emergency hospital in Tamarack, Florida.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let’s put a pin in this. You tell me what happened.\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): When I went to gently grab the dog from him, she went to nip at me. I asked him, \"Oh, are you a biter?\" And he said, \"No.\" And then I asked him, \"Is she cage-shy?\" And he said, \"No, she’s used to being crated.\" So I took the dog, and she seemed a little nervous. I gave the dog to the bather, and that’s when I heard the \"ow!\" The dog went to bite the bather twice.\n\nJudge: Did the bather have gloves on?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): No, he did not.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did the bather drop the dog?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): No, he did not.\n\nJudge: So what happened to the dog?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): The bather put the dog in the kennel as we normally do, and he said he wasn’t going to get the dog out because it bit him. So I went and tried to get the dog out with a towel. I opened the kennel door, and it lunged at me with teeth. I tried to grab it, and I couldn’t.\n\nJudge: Wait, why are you going like this?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Because I went like this to grab it, and it went—\n\nJudge: Wait, hold on. You’re in control of the door. You already know there’s a problem because, according to you, your employee told you there was a problem. So you’re opening the door. It lunges towards you, but doesn’t it lunge at the towel? Because you have the towel close enough where there’s no room for the dog to actually jump out and break a leg.\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): That was the thing. It went right when I—I tried to close my arms as it lunged to try to grab it, and I didn’t.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t catch the dog. You were far enough away where catching wasn’t possible. Why wouldn’t your towel be closer to the door?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Because they’re stacked.\n\nJudge: They’re stacked. All right. So then what happens?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): The dog goes flying. As soon as it hit the ground, it broke its leg.\n\nJudge: Right. So you did the right thing and immediately went to the veterinarian.\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Absolutely.\n\nJudge: And you have something that you have people sign beforehand, right? A release?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Exactly.\n\nJudge: Let me see your release.\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Here it is.\n\n[Document examination]\n\nJudge: Does your release give you the authority to take the dog to a vet in an emergency situation?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Correct.\n\nJudge: All right. And what ended up being wrong with the dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Both bones in the lower leg were broken.\n\nJudge: What was the necessary medical care?\n\nPlaintiff: The emergency vet stabilized her but recommended surgery with a metal plate and wires. The cost was between $3,000 and $4,000.\n\nJudge: Do you have the reports and bills?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here they are.\n\n[Document examination]\n\nJudge: Why do you feel you’re not responsible?\n\nDefendant (Jessica Gonzalez): Because of the release form.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t waive liability for negligence. The dog was under your care.

{"id": "10", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Sharon Oliver, yes, you are suing the dealership. You've asked us not to mention the dealership's name, represented here by Gregory Cohen. Yes, you're the manager?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: For $5,000 for fraud that you say they perpetrated on you by lying to you about whether the car you bought from them had been in an accident.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, okay.\n\nJudge: Tell me what’s happening.\n\nPlaintiff: On May 22nd of 2010, I purchased a 2006 Ford Explorer from their dealership. On June 20th of this year, I traded in that same truck to another dealership, a Chevy dealership. When I traded the truck, they told me that the truck had frame damage. And I told them that the truck did not have frame damage because the truck was clean according to the dealership where I purchased the car from two years ago. That same dealership, the Chevy dealership, showed me the auto check and told me that they couldn’t give me the full value of the truck because it had been hit. Once I looked at the auto check and it showed that it was hit in December of 2019, I called up the dealership that I got the truck from and I relayed that to them while I was in the dealership on Long Island. They told me, “No, our CARFAX is clean; the truck has not been hit.” And that’s what they told me when I purchased it.\n\nJudge: What did they tell you back then?\n\nPlaintiff: The CARFAX is clean.\n\nJudge: Yes, and you were now at a Chevy dealership and they were telling you, “Look, auto check,” do you have the auto check? Let me see.\n\nDefendant: Auto check is the competing business to Carfax. Well, AutoCheck is more for auctions. They're really not used at the sales level. CARFAX is used at the sales level.\n\nPlaintiff: They received the car from an auction in New Jersey.\n\nDefendant: Yeah, but they use Carfax. We have AutoCheck. Do you use AutoCheck?\n\nDefendant: When, at that point, it’s announced or it’s not announced. I actually wasn’t the one that purchased the car; I’m the sales manager, so I wasn’t the one that actually purchased the vehicle. It states that it was announced.\n\nPlaintiff: If you had purchased the vehicle, if there's an auto check and the auto check shows damage, what does the dealership do?\n\nDefendant: We wouldn’t purchase the car. Right? We’re a franchise dealer, we have too much to lose.\n\nJudge: Too much to lose. You’re going to have a problem selling it.\n\nDefendant: Absolutely.\n\nJudge: Unless it’s completely hidden and you’re getting it at a good price.\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nPlaintiff: Page four, it says auction. Oh, what is this though? This says 12/17/2009, auto auction announced as unibody damage.\n\nJudge: When did you guys buy it?\n\nDefendant: We purchased a car 12/14/2009. I have that. We purchased the vehicle with absolutely no problems with the car.\n\nPlaintiff: Do you have any paperwork from the auction?\n\nDefendant: No, I don’t. What did you just look at?\n\nJudge: This is the Carfax.\n\nDefendant: The Carfax has when you purchased it. Absolutely, it's the same as auto check.\n\nPlaintiff: Take a look at the auto check. What is that saying?\n\nDefendant: No, it’s saying that it was announced, but we do check Carfax. We don’t check AutoCheck.\n\nPlaintiff: You said that in auctions you check AutoCheck.\n\nDefendant: Well, I personally don’t buy the cars, I heard that.\n\nPlaintiff: But you said that your dealership at auctions checks AutoCheck. And AutoCheck is saying—but this—look, is this not saying even more than that, which is auction announced as unibody damage?\n\nDefendant: I don’t, like I said, I’m not that well-versed in how we purchase the vehicles.\n\nJudge: That’s what the whole case is about.\n\nDefendant: I understand, but yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: Why did they send you…\n\nDefendant: I was actually the first person to get the negative review and try and work it out with them because you saw that on what site?\n\nPlaintiff: On Carfax.\n\nDefendant: Oh, on DealerRater?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant: There is a part of your job is to constantly mine and see if anybody’s trashing you guys and try to work it out?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant: So you called her and said what?\n\nDefendant: My upper management told me that I can offer her a maintenance plan for her new car. I can offer her a few details for her new car. I can offer her a $500 gas card. These are the things that I was allowed to offer up to my authority.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t want that stuff either if I lost $5,000.\n\nJudge: So it’s one way or the other. Either she has no case, or she has a case. And if she has a case, she has a $5,000 case because they gave her… Do you have the paperwork from Chevy for, to prove the amount of money that they docked you for the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have that.\n\nJudge: Well, you're going to need to get it. And you are going to need to get—We’re going to take a recess now, and you're going to need to get the name, the paperwork from the auction, the purchase of this car, and we’re going to get to the bottom of this. Court, some recess.\n\nJudge: All right, so the defendant… Let's say he didn’t really know and just was told the plaintiff of what he knew. Is he responsible for the fact that it wasn’t an accident?\n\nPlaintiff: I would say if he didn’t have common knowledge of it, then he would not be responsible. That’s on Carfax. What do you think?\n\nJudge: He’s not responsible for it.\n\nPlaintiff: Especially if he got a Carfax.\n\nJudge: No. Is anybody think he is responsible?\n\nDefendant: Huh? No, I don’t think he’s responsible for it either.\n\nJudge: How about that going inside the courtroom?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand.\n\nJudge: That was a productive recess. So let me see your paperwork, and let me see your paperwork. You see, you have paperwork from the car dealership?\n\nJudge: This is good. This paperwork shows that you got 16,000 for the trade-in. You had said you got eight. That was a balance carried over, and we were trying to do the math between that paperwork and the old paperwork from their dealership. I don’t know what you’re saying. Next to the words “gross trading allowance,” it says 16,000. That’s the amount they gave you for the trade-in, and you bought the car for how much?\n\nPlaintiff: She purchased a vehicle in 2010 for 23.\n\nJudge: So that would be, you know, a $7,000 depreciation in two years. And why would that not be normal? In other words, what I’m saying is this paperwork doesn’t even show you have damages, right?\n\nPlaintiff: But they verbally told me that I did, and I have the auto check. But the problem was I couldn’t get them to send me a document stating that what they gave me as opposed to what I should have gotten, and that’s all the paperwork that I have.\n\nJudge: You understand though that you got 16,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. And you understand you paid 23 for it two years before you traded it in, right? So where would your loss be? Why would… And I pulled a CI Blue Book for a Ford Explorer to see what the depreciation should be in two years, and that’s just about on the money. So where would your loss be?\n\nPlaintiff: You know, but…\n\nJudge: And you know I’m looking at them. I see it.\n\nPlaintiff: I understand that you’re angry because you feel like you got duped, but if you're not out anything, you’re not out of anything, and you can’t collect anything. That’s one. But two, I see that AutoCheck says that there was… This was an auction with unibody damage. I saw that. I got news for you. It wasn’t. Here’s the paperwork. And it makes sense because why would a dealership, when they have an entire yard full of cars to pick from at an auction, pick the one with unibody damage that’s going to cause them all kinds of issues later? They’re not. What they’re going to do is they’re going to pick the ones, 90% of them, that don’t have unibody damage.

She was supposed to spruce up the landscaping, the painting, and the furnishings so it looked nice to potential buyers. One day before she was scheduled to show up to do the work, she emailed him saying she was quitting. He lost out on rent, the sale of the house was greatly delayed, and he's here suing her for the $7,000 she cost him.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Alice Camp. She says she was forced to back out of the deal by a competing realtor who strong-armed her into canceling her deal with the plaintiff. She told the plaintiff she was sorry, but there was just too much drama, and she wasn't going to be able to stage his house as discussed. Bottom line: she's not responsible for the inability of the plaintiff to sell his house in a bad market and doesn't owe him all this money. She’s accused of backing out.\n\nJudge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff hired the defendant to fix up his house, and that person flaked out. But the defendant says the plaintiff is blaming her for a bad real estate market. It’s the case of “The Fix Isn’t In.”\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Donald Son, you are suing Alice Camp for $7,000 that you feel you are owed. You actually feel you're owed a lot more than that, but that’s the statutory maximum in your state of Massachusetts because, according to you, she breached a contract to stage your home. All right, what happened here?\n\nPlaintiff: Earlier this winter, I decided to sell my home, and I wanted to find a stager—who, if you don’t know, is somebody that takes your home and gives you recommendations about how to fix it up, make it look nice. They also typically furnish your home with sort of fake furniture to make it look lived in and make it look nice—\n\nJudge: Instead of the furniture that was already there?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s right.\n\nJudge: You were renting that place out? You had tenants there?\n\nPlaintiff: I was, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, was it a house?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a freestanding house.\n\nJudge: Do you need a degree to be a stager or just—\n\nDefendant: No, no, I actually work for investors primarily. And when they do a flip on a house and it’s empty, I bring in the furniture and get it ready for—\n\nJudge: You own the furniture?\n\nDefendant: I buy it, I have it, yes.\n\nJudge: So you have a storage facility with all that furniture?\n\nDefendant: I do, yeah.\n\nJudge: All right. And then you bring the furniture in because it's nicer than what there is in there. And you have the chachkis and the knickknacks, and you have the style. All right, how long have you been doing this?\n\nDefendant: Oh, about a little over three years now.\n\nJudge: Is this your full-time job?\n\nDefendant: No, no, absolutely not.\n\nJudge: What’s your full-time job?\n\nDefendant: I'm a real estate agent.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. So he contacts you, and at the time, he hasn't listed the place yet, right?\n\nDefendant: No, no.\n\nJudge: In fact, you were hoping to get the listing?\n\nDefendant: Well, it would have been nice. I gave him some advice.\n\nJudge: All right. So you were going to charge him how much to stage the place?\n\nDefendant: $2,500.\n\nJudge: Did you get a deposit or anything?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, one of the first things that had to be done in order to stage a place is you got to get the renters out, right? Because you want to fix the place up. Was their lease up?\n\nPlaintiff: No, their lease wasn’t up. They were sort of in a month-to-month type of lease.\n\nJudge: All right. So you gave them their 30-day notice, right? And when did the tenants move out?\n\nPlaintiff: In May, at the end of May.\n\nJudge: Okay, now we’re in June. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I was really getting anxious to try to get this house on the market. And there were some delays, mostly just waiting for the tenants to leave, but also on Alice’s company’s part, where she just kept on saying the workers were—\n\nJudge: Who were the workers?\n\nDefendant: My daughter and her boyfriend have a small painting and handyman business on the side.\n\nJudge: Are they licensed?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you have any idea that they weren’t licensed?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what happened? Get to the breach.\n\nPlaintiff: The day before they were supposed to come, she sends me an email saying she’s not going to do the work, canceling everything.\n\nJudge: Why did you back out?\n\nDefendant: I got a phone call from a real estate agent with my former company. It was ugly, and I just didn’t want to be involved in the drama.\n\nJudge: Okay. But even if she breached, you didn’t pay her a deposit. You lost rent because you cleared the place out, but why does she owe you rent?\n\nPlaintiff: She told me to give my tenants notice immediately—\n\nJudge: But how is she responsible for your lost rent? All you had to do was find another stager.\n\nPlaintiff: I contacted several contractors, several painters, several landscapers—\n\nJudge: And?\n\nPlaintiff: By June, all the quality workers in my area were taken. One contractor returned my call, but his quote was much higher.\n\nJudge: You chose not to do it. So, why should she pay you rent and extra costs?\n\nPlaintiff: I estimated the premium costs due to summer—\n\nJudge: But you have no proof. You need to show me an estimate comparing before and after.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have it.\n\nJudge: That was your shot.\n\nPlaintiff: I did landscaping—\n\nJudge: So, why are you suing for an extra $500 for landscaping?\n\nPlaintiff: The new landscaper charged more.\n\nJudge: Show me proof.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have it.\n\nJudge: Mr. Son, I am ordering a verdict in your favor in the amount of $1. Pay the man.\n\n(### After the Judgment)\n\nReporter: What do you think about that?\n\nDefendant: I felt like I had given him a good reason, and I think the judge’s verdict was fair.\n\nReporter: You going to do this again?\n\nDefendant: I think I’ll stick with my usual clients.\n\nReporter: Mr. Son, $1. How do you feel?\n\nPlaintiff: I feel justice was served. She was found at fault. That’s fair.\n\nJudge: The $1 judgment is because technically the defendant breached, but there are no real damages.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, deflection, evasion, exaggeration"}

Marcus Carter, you are suing your sisters Tiffany and Trisha (neither of you want your last name used) for $2,231 that you say they owe you for phones, phone cases, and loans. How do we get here? Let me hear from you first, Marcus.\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nApparently at some point in July of 2018, you decided both of your sisters should have cell phones on your plan.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, terrible idea. I cannot begin to tell you how terrible that is, just terrible, terrible idea. So now, had you been close to your sisters before this?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nMhm.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so what happens to cause you to put them on your plan?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nMy sister, it was her birthday.\n\nJudge:\nWhich one?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nTiffany.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so your sister, it was your sister Tiffany's birthday. Yeah, and therefore, what?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nShe wanted an iPhone 10.\n\nJudge:\niPhone 10?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so I have a business account with Sprint and they give you the phones, nothing down. Texas, so I thought it'd be a good present, but me and her agreed that it would be $100 a month.\n\nJudge:\nAnd did that include the price of the phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nYeah, it was just everything in.\n\nJudge:\nSo what's your present if you're not giving her the phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nShe thinks the phone is the present.\n\nJudge:\nWho said it was a present?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nShe said it was a present.\n\nJudge:\nYou just told me it was her birthday and that she wanted a phone.\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nYeah, that don’t... yeah, but I ain't... no, it's not a present.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, no, I got it. We agreed that she would pay $100 per month.\n\nJudge:\nDid you agree to pay $100 per month?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nUm, 75, not 100.\n\nJudge:\nNo? Oh no, okay.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how was, what was the breakdown of the 75?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\n75 was for the service, not for the actual phone. It was just for the service.\n\nJudge:\nThe phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nSo you thought that the iPhone 10, which is like $1,000-something, was a birthday present from your brother?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nIf you ask me what do I want for my birthday, and I say an iPhone, and you call me back and ask me the iPhone 9 or 10, of course I'm going to say 10. I assumed it was a birthday gift.\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nOkay, so you’re paying for the service because I don't know if I could've got a Sprint in my name or not. So he said $75 a month for the service, not the phone. The phone was a gift.\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nThis is what I assumed.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so all right. Well, the service itself is how much a month?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\n35.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, so the rest of it, you know how these, they give you these deals now where you buy a phone that if anybody had asked you 10 years ago, \"Will you buy a $1,000 cell phone?\" You'd say, \"Hell no.\" And now what you do is you pay for them without interest monthly so you don't feel the hit all at once. You end up paying 40 something, 50 something, 20 something, whatever your phone is going to cost a month until you're done paying it, unless of course it gets canceled. Then you have to pay the whole thing up front.\n\nJudge:\nSo lo and behold, what day do we get the phones?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nHer phone July 29th.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what about the other sister?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nI don't know if it was the next day.\n\nJudge:\nWhy do you get a phone for the other sister? Is it her birthday too?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nNo, so you just... because she was going through a few things and I think she needed a phone to get through these things, so me and her had a different agreement.\n\nJudge:\nNo, she didn't have any phone before this?\n\nDefendant (Trisha):\nI've had a cell phone, but it had been turned off or what, or...\n\nJudge:\nNo, I just didn't have a cell phone at the time.\n\nJudge:\nHow long had you not had the cell phone?\n\nDefendant (Trisha):\nMaybe a year or so.\n\nJudge:\nYou lived for a year without a cell phone?\n\nDefendant (Trisha):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJudge:\nHow'd you do it?\n\nDefendant (Trisha):\nWi-Fi.\n\nJudge:\nOh, Wi-Fi you have? Okay, you didn’t not have a cell phone, you didn’t have cell phone service. You used your phone, but through Wi-Fi, is that right?\n\nDefendant (Trisha):\nOr through my children’s service, yes. I personally didn’t have it.\n\nJudge:\nSo you decided to get her a phone too. Did she ask you or did you ask her or how did that come about?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nI asked her, did she need a phone? She said yes.\n\nJudge:\nSo at some point very quickly after you got the telephones for your sisters, there arises a family argument, and the argument has to do with an older sister who’s not here and, much to your chagrin, they take the older sister’s side. Does that make sense?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nI mean they was all in league together. They all knew it.\n\nJudge:\nYou get angry at them because they take the other sister’s side and what happens then?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nOne particular day, I was helping her move to her house.\n\nJudge:\nWhich one is her?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nTrisha.\n\nJudge:\nRight, okay. And her and my fiancé got into it, and I called the police.\n\nJudge:\nThe police?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nAnybody get arrested?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. She comes up acting like she wants to fight me.\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nFight you, which one?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nTiffany.\n\nJudge:\nTiffany comes to the house when you call?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nOnce you call the police on Trisha, Tiffany comes over like she wants smoke, but like she... what?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nLike she wants smoke.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and I just asked him at that point, I said, \"Can I have my phones back?\" Tiffany told me to get it, like Tyson. Like how Mike Tyson would get it.\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nWhy don't you tell me what happened that day?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nYeah, are you talking about the day that he called the police or from the beginning?\n\nJudge:\nWell, from the beginning, go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nOkay, well from the beginning, like I said, he gave me the phone for my birthday. I assumed...\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever make a payment?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nYes, I did.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he cut our phones off in a week?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nHold on, hold on. What day did you make a payment?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nI think that following Friday after he gave me the phone, ‘cause I got paid then.\n\nJudge:\nHow should you pay on that price?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\n$75.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how much did you pay?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nI didn’t pay anything.\n\nJudge:\nHow come?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nBecause my bill was supposed to be free ‘cause I didn’t have or ask for a phone.\n\nJudge:\nWere you supposed to be paying her bills?\n\nPlaintiff (Marcus Carter):\nI told her, until she got on her feet, her bill, like...\n\nJudge:\nSo where are the phones now, guys?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nThey’ve been disconnected.\n\nJudge:\nNo phones left?\n\nDefendant (Tiffany):\nI don’t have the phone.\n\nJudge:\nI’ll tell you what, I’m just going to rule in favor of Marcus, the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection & Playing the Victim,Evasion"}
{"id": "999", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Mr. and Mrs. Martin, welcome. You are suing Mr. McCarthy with Creative Custom Cabinetry, doing business as Treehouse Brothers, for $5,000, the statutory maximum. You say you’re actually out a deposit of $7,500 and you want your money back. Why? What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** Your honor, back in May of 2018, my husband and I decided to have a treehouse built in our backyard for the kids as a reward for doing well in school. I did some research online and came across the Treehouse Brothers, owned by James McCarthy. They had an impressive website and seemed enthusiastic about building treehouses, so I reached out. James came to our house, drew up some plans, and we signed an estimate. We then gave him a deposit.\n\n**Judge:** How much was the treehouse going to cost in total?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** $115,000.\n\n**Judge:** And how much did you pay upfront?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** $7,500.\n\n**Judge:** Did the contract specify how long it should take?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** No.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. McCarthy, how long should this have taken?\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** Every treehouse is unique, but I estimated two to three weeks for pre-fabrication, then one week of on-site work.\n\n**Judge:** Mrs. Martin, how long did you wait before canceling the job?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** About five weeks. We got the permit on July 3rd, sent him a check on July 6th, which he received on the 9th, and it cleared on the 11th. Once he cashed the check, he stopped communicating. We tried to get in touch, and he initially said he ordered materials with express delivery, but a week passed, and nothing showed up.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. McCarthy, what was the delay?\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** The materials arrived, but I was waiting on special treehouse attachment bolts. Then I had a car accident and totaled my truck.\n\n**Judge:** Mrs. Martin, what happened next?\n\n**Plaintiff (Nancy Martin):** By August 9th, my husband lost his patience. He texted, demanding an update, and Mr. McCarthy responded that he was at a funeral. That same day, we sent him a letter demanding a refund.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. McCarthy, did you call them back?\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** Yes. Glenn was very aggressive on the phone and demanded I be there by Wednesday. I said I’d be there by Monday.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Martin, were you aggressive?\n\n**Plaintiff (Glenn Martin):** I was frustrated with all the excuses—the delays, the lack of communication. I didn’t think the treehouse would ever get built.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. McCarthy, did Mr. Martin threaten you?\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** Yes. He told me he was an important person and would send Vinnie and Rocco to my house.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Martin, did you say that?\n\n**Plaintiff (Glenn Martin):** Absolutely not! That’s ridiculous.\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** He even asked if I was recording the call and then said, \"Well, it’s my word against yours.\"\n\n**Judge:** Okay, let’s take a step back. Mr. McCarthy, do you still have the materials?\n\n**Defendant (James McCarthy):** Most of it.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Um, I was out at the Riverhead Raceway on a Saturday night, and we left there about 10:00. I got on the Long Island Expressway, put the cruise control on. All of a sudden, I... oh crap, there's a deer, and I start slowing down, and it turned out to be a horse. And there were two horses in the middle of... what kind of... they were right on the Long Island Expressway! Oh my God! They were on the shoulder, so I start slowing down, and the horses start moving. I'm like, \"He's not going to run in front of me,\" and then the horse ran in front of me, and I hit him. I slammed on the brakes. I skidded the horse. I must have knocked him off his legs. He landed on my hood, rolled over the windshield, over the roof of the car, and then got up and walked away. Not a scratch on him. Not... well, maybe a little scratch, but not...\n\nJudge: How’s the horse?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): He got a big smile. So I see the horse was fine. He’s living... he's living large, apparently. 'Cause the horse’s curfew is apparently, uh, a little better than my children’s.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Tell me what’s going on. We were at the movies, my wife and I. We were coming back home on the expressway, the L, which is like 55 miles an hour. And more, you know, nobody does the speed limit. But anyway, we noticed the, um, after our exit was blocked. The whole expressway was blocked by police. So I said, \"Oh my God, it must be a bad accident.\" Now, we get off the expressway, and we live not far from there, and we went home. And if you have horses or any type of livestock, you usually go check it when you leave the house or be gone for a while. Sure enough, I looked in the backyard, and the gate is open. The gate is open, the gate was like J open, not destroyed, but open, and yeah, it was... yes, but your... does your horse have a posable digits? Like, how did your horse open the gate? What kind of gate?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Pretty... he's pretty... yeah. Well, how did it open the gate? I don’t know. Why do you have a gate open? He did, he did push it open. He pushed it open. It was bent, kind of. One of the walls were broken of the gate. I had gave it to the insurance company.\n\nJudge: Oh, how’d that work out?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): They, um... well, we were going to settle it privately, and we couldn’t, uh, come to a price agreement. And we did then decide to, uh, go to the insurance company.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): The insurance company looked at my fence, the barn, all the facility, and checked everything out, and they decided it wasn’t my fault, and they denied his claim.\n\nJudge: Whose fault is it?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): That’s what I said. They said it was the horse’s fault.\n\nJudge: What insurance company do you have?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): State... no. State Farm did not do that. I have a letter from them saying, \"Get out of here.\" Swear to God, there’s no such animal. Pardon the pun.\n\nJudge: Give me that letter from State Farm.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Either you possess a gate that contains an animal, or you do not possess a gate that contains an animal. And the proof is in the fact that the animals are cha-chying down the Long Island Expressway. I’m sorry, that’s quite, that’s just ridiculous, utterly ridiculous. I mean seriously, didn’t you think it was ridiculous? ‘Cause you’ve got a Cheshire cat grin on. I mean, you have to know this is ridiculous. It’s not going to be his fault. He’s the only guy I know whose fault it isn’t.\n\nJudge: What do the police do? What do they say? How did that go?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): I was actually a little upset with the police, ‘cause the deputy, the sheriff, they closed the expressway. There had to be 15 or 20 of them there, and not one of them came over to see if I was okay. They all went over to the horse. Yeah, the poor horse, the pretty horse. Finally, I yelled across the highway, all six lanes, “Hey!” And one of them came over. I said, \"What about me? Covered with broken glass?\" And, \"Oh, you okay?\" \"Well, yeah, thanks for asking.\" Well, we know you... you don’t know who was in these cars. There were like six people standing there. So I was a little upset that nobody came to check on me.\n\nJudge: Let me see pictures of your car, and let me see the estimates for repair. You’re driving a 1995... what?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Toyota Avalon.\n\nJudge: Okay, why are you asking for $4,000? That’s my first question.\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Well, the book value of the car at the time was around $3,000, and then it’s been a storage... I had to pay... and the estimate was crazy. They were like $6,000 to repair.\n\nJudge: Let me see proof that you, uh, that you paid for storage.\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Where was it stored?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Uh, at the muffler shop. That’s where I had it towed. I usually take my vehicles there to get repaired.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but you know, usually it takes a few days to figure out this is a total loss, which is what you’re suing for. So why would you have 66 days of storage?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): He wouldn't give me a receipt unless I paid him.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you have proof that you paid it?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Yeah, right there.\n\nJudge: Why would you have it there 66 days? Why so long?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Well, because I expected his insurance company to come give me my money, take the car away. Right? And then they denied it. And now what do I do? You know, I’m like, I can’t get rid of the car. Where do you...\n\nJudge: You got that the Blue Book value is $3,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): I got that on, uh, Kelly Blue Book.\n\nJudge: What model did you drive?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Avalon.\n\nJudge: What? Could you be more specific?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Um... do you have the title to it?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see it?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): ‘Cause the difference is that your Blue Book has an XLS. I don’t know if that’s on the title.\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Should be.\n\nJudge: Oh my goodness.\n\nJudge: The horse hit the windshield. He rolled over the... I hit him on the hood and he just rolled over the windshield halfway through, over the roof, and off the side. And why is it a total loss?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Uh, because it’s like $6,000 to fix a $3,000 car.\n\nJudge: Right, you’re on. May I say something?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): I live for the moment. So if a horse gets out of a gate somehow and the, um, the horse lands on, on the driver’s windshield, is the horse owner responsible for the broken windshield?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): I think you're probably, he’s probably responsible for that horse, uh, forever. I’d say, and I’d say you have... so whatever the horse does, the owner’s responsible. I’d say so.\n\nJudge: Yeah, even if he doesn’t know how the gate opened, I think he’s probably responsible for the gate and the horse.\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): What do you think?\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Uh, I think the insurance company has... the insurance company wouldn’t pay, though. That’s the, that’s the thing here. You get the final words.\n\nJudge: I think that he’s definitely responsible for that horse and always will be. Fair enough.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom. Can I see those photographs?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Yeah. And you, she can look at the photographs of the horse if she wants to.\n\nJudge: Would you like to see the photos of the horse, Shar?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Yes. Yes, I would. I want to see if the... I want to see the horse that did this damage to this car and walked away with like, uh, minor scratches.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Very little, very little damage on him. Very little damage on the horse.\n\nJudge: But there's going to be some damage to your pocket in a second, which is a good thing.\n\nJudge: But it is a good thing. The thing is, I have to say, is it is a good thing, and frankly, after I rule and damage your pocket, you should go back to State Farm and ask them, \"What are they thinking?\" Because I’ve been a State Farm customer all my life, and I’m very surprised to have seen that, that letter. I don’t know how else you do the math if the gate has to be sturdy enough that a horse can’t go through it. If the horse did, by definition, then you didn’t contain your animal. I mean, that’s, it’s... you know?\n\nJudge: I also say, uh, your honor, is that, um, this car was placed at his friend’s shop. It’s a friend of his, and when I went to look at the car, which was probably a couple days right after the accident, um, I was thinking about buying it and giving it to my daughter, fixing it up, because it didn’t look that bad. It needed a windshield, it needed a hood. And actually, a friend of his, who does body work and used to work there, came and gave you an estimate of the car and we... from $750 to $1,000 to fix the car hood, windshield, head.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Did you have that in writing?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): No, I do not.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): Did they tell you that it would be a $1,000 to fix?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Anybody can, can make a car drivable again, but that’s not what I had. I mean, the car has dents in the roof now and the doors, all of that wouldn’t have been fixed for $700,000.\n\nDefendant (Charles Ludi): But did they tell you they would fix it for $1,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): No. You’re... now we’re done. I mean, I don’t, I don’t want to drive a half-crashed-up car, you know, with a blue fender and a green fender and a, and a purple hood. You know, for $700.\n\nJudge: No, I, I mean, I think the $6,000 estimate is bloated. I do think that, but I also think that we're... it’s probably a total loss because I’m valuing the car less than he is. So, I find that you are at fault. I find in favor of the plaintiff for the following: the $150 tofi. Did your friend charge you for storage? The $990 because he says it was out of friends. Why would the friend have charged you $990? What kind of friend is that?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): Well, was somebody who came out on a Sunday, you know.\n\nJudge: Do you have a canceled check?\n\nPlaintiff (Rudolph Luk): No, I paid cash.\n\nJudge: I feel funny about that, I’ve got to tell you.\n\nJudge: So I’m going to do what we call a little rough justice here. I am going to find in favor of the plaintiff. I’m going to limit his damages to what I think is reasonable, and what I think is reasonable is $2,700.

Where were you going?\n\nPlaintiff: I made reservations to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.\n\nJudge: To Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Okay. And when you made the reservations, did she pick the place with you, or did you pick the place?\n\nPlaintiff: We talked about the trip.\n\nJudge: That wasn't my question.

But before we took the trip, on June 21st, she sent me a text message saying her money was available immediately.\n\nJudge: Can I see that text message?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: While you're looking for that, Maria, did you agree to go on the trip with her?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Except, according to her, you didn’t pay for your half. Why not?\n\nDefendant: Because that’s not the way it was. I was supposed to do the reservations. I went to three different places. I went to the travel agency to schedule the reservation. I did it on the phone, calling numbers, and I even went through a friend. After doing all this, she says to leave it up to her, that she would take care of everything.\n\nJudge: And what did you say when she said that?\n\nDefendant: That’s okay. She was going to pay for everything and take care of everything.\n\nJudge: Wait, I don’t understand. You were supposed to pay for half the trip. Just because she picked the hotel, now you don’t pay for any of the trip?\n\nDefendant: We never agreed to that. She said she was going to take care of everything.\n\nJudge: So are you saying you were never supposed to pay anything?\n\nDefendant: I never talked to her about paying.\n\nJudge: That’s not my question. Before you go on a trip, don’t you figure out what it’s going to cost you?\n\nDefendant: I wanted to book what I liked, where I wanted to go.\n\nJudge: Right, but when she says, \"Leave it up to me,\" what happened? Did you get there and not have a good time?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn’t. She booked a three-and-a-half-star hotel, and there was no beach. I wanted the beach. That was my dream. But there was no beach—just a lake with seaweed. We had to take a car 15 minutes away to find a real beach.\n\nJudge: Did you look at the hotel before boarding the plane?\n\nDefendant: I never did.\n\nJudge: And according to both of you, you got into a fight on the trip, right?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have a fight with her.\n\nJudge: Maria, did you have a fight with Carmen?\n\nDefendant: She had a fight with me.\n\nJudge: About what?\n\nPlaintiff: One day at the beach, I told her I was going to the pool, but she wanted to go back to the room to get ready for dinner. When I returned, she was yelling at me, treating me like a child. She said she had been looking for me and couldn't find me. But the hotel had two pools, and I was at one of them.\n\nJudge: When was she supposed to pay you?\n\nPlaintiff: Before the trip.\n\nJudge: Maria, I’m looking at a text where you say, \"My money is at your disposal.\" What does that mean?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. I haven’t seen that text.\n\nJudge: Here, let me show you. Why don’t you tell me what that means?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. She was hanging out with other people and left me alone all the time. It was unpleasant.\n\nJudge: That entitles you to be mad at her and not go on a trip with her again. That does not entitle you to stiff her for the money you owe her. You agreed to split the cost of the trip, and that’s exactly what you’re going to do. My judgment is for the plaintiff in the amount of $98.

Darcy, you're suing Heather, your former landlord, for $1,400 that you want returned to you—the money that you paid for July rent for part of it, plus the last month which you paid at the beginning of going in there. You are counterclaiming against her for the remainder of July, the remainder of the last month, because according to you, she left after that, plus damages.\n\nHow long did you live in that apartment?\n\nPlaintiff (Darcy):\nI originally moved in on January 2017 on the third floor, but then I ended up moving down to the first floor.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you move down to the first floor?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAugust of 2017.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you had been—and when did you move out?\n\nPlaintiff:\nEnd of July.\n\nJudge:\nYou spent about a year down on the first floor, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, and why did you move from the third floor?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause the third floor was infested with bed bugs and it had mice as well.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did it get infested?\n\nPlaintiff:\nShortly after I moved in.\n\nJudge:\nYou moved in in January and you moved to the bottom floor in August. How did you let her know that there were bed bugs?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI texted her.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, do you have the text from January of 2017 to show me that you texted her?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any emails?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did she let you know there were bed bugs?\n\nDefendant (Heather):\nShe probably let me know when she moved into number five, which was downstairs in August, but I would say probably a couple months after that.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so according to you, she had never complained about bed bugs in January of 2017 when she was upstairs?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, she did not.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have texts with her in your phone?\n\nDefendant:\nI have plenty of texts from her.\n\nJudge:\nLet's see if that’s from 2017 or 2018.\n\nDefendant:\nI mean, she did notify me of the bed bugs but not till much later.\n\nJudge:\nSo these texts go back to September of 2017.

I was just trying to get rent from her.\n\nJudge:\nDid she leave damages?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, she left a bed, a table, a mirror, and the refrigerator was dirty.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have pictures?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. I find that you are entitled to $200 for trash removal and $750 for painting, totaling $950. I find that you, Darcy, are entitled to $1,400.

{"id": "531", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. The plaintiff hired the defendant to find a DJ for a party, but the DJ got in a car accident, and now the defendant refuses to return the money. The defendant says the DJ was ready, willing, and able. It's the case of \"Can’t Stop the Music.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Anette Dunlap, you are suing a DJ company represented here by its owner, John M. for $1,500. You want him to pay you $300, money that you paid him to DJ and, according to you, he didn’t show up. $300 for a replacement DJ. $400 for bank fees—you’re going to have to explain that to me—and $500 for pain and suffering. So you've managed to turn a $300 case into a $1,500 case, mushrooming it into five times what you're actually out. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I hired the DJ company to come and DJ for my New Year's party.\n\nJudge: Had you ever used them before?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: How did you find them?\n\nPlaintiff: Through a search engine. I picked them because they had good reviews, seemed professional, and with the other DJs I found, they gave me the best price.\n\nJudge: So, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I paid them. They told me the budget was $349, and I paid them $300. The day before the party, they called me and said the DJ got in an accident and wouldn’t be able to come.\n\nJudge: Who called you and told you that?\n\nPlaintiff: A lady named Amanda V. She was the main person I dealt with.\n\nJudge: Have you ever dealt with John?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I was told to deal with John during the refund process. But he never returned any of my calls.\n\nJudge: Did you ever meet him before today?\n\nPlaintiff: No. Everything was by phone and email. The only person I talked to and corresponded with was Amanda V.\n\nJudge: So Amanda V. gave you a heads-up the day before New Year's Eve and said one of their DJs got into a car accident and wouldn’t be showing up?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How were they planning on solving the problem?\n\nPlaintiff: She said they could give me a refund or lease out another contract with another company, but I would have to pay $500 instead.\n\nJudge: Why wouldn’t they cover the extra $200?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s what I asked. I said, \"Why don’t you eat the extra $200?\" They refused, so I opted for the refund and asked for proof. I got an email from someone named Roxan Simonetti, but it had the DJ company’s logo and contact information.\n\nJudge: John, what actually happened?\n\nDefendant: We were hired to DJ the event. That night, we had multiple parties. The DJ scheduled for her event had an earlier gig before hers. Her party was from 12:30 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., so he was scheduled to do a double shift.\n\nJudge: Wait, her event was from 12:30 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it was supposed to be from 11:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nDefendant: The night before the event, we called the client and were told the party was canceled.\n\nJudge: She canceled on you?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: So there was never a car accident?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: You didn’t overextend yourself and make up a car accident?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Really? You didn’t just book too many parties and ditch her because she was getting a good price?\n\nDefendant: Not at all.\n\nJudge: Show me the email.\n\nPlaintiff: Here’s the original email and my response when they never contacted me about my refund.\n\nJudge: Who is Roxan Simonetti?\n\nDefendant: She’s a secretary at our company.\n\nJudge: Roxan sent an email saying the DJ scheduled for the event was in an accident and wouldn’t be able to attend. It offers a refund or a contract with another company for $500. John, what is this?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: You don’t know? You denied under oath that a DJ was in an accident, yet your own secretary sent this email?\n\nDefendant: I had no idea.\n\nJudge: Who else would instruct her to make that up?\n\nDefendant: I have no idea.\n\nJudge: Why would a secretary make this up unless you told her to?\n\nJudge: You left her hanging, and then when she went to the bank for a refund, you disputed it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have proof.\n\nJudge: Let me see it.\n\nPlaintiff: Here’s proof my bank reversed my claim because they said the DJ company told them I wasn't owed money.\n\nJudge: Jonathan, you signed this. It states, \"All supporting documents are attached. There are no refunds.\"\n\nJudge: No refunds? Even when you breach?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Unbelievable. Here’s what we’re going to do. There is no pain and suffering in a contracts case, but I find this very painful. I’m ordering you to reimburse the $300 you stole, the $68 in bank fees, and an additional $300 as punitive damages for willful breach. Total: $668.

What happened?\n\n[Plaintiff]I applied for an apartment that she had for rent and gave her a little bit of money bit by bit. I guess the date that I signed the lease, I went to try to put the lights on in my name, and I had an old bill which I could not pay.\n\n[Judge]Okay, back up. So you were going to move in when?\n\n[Plaintiff]September 1st.\n\n[Judge]And do you have a lease?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes, I had the lease.\n\n[Judge]Do you have a copy of it? And does the lease start on September 1st?\n\n[Plaintiff]Yes, it was supposed to start September 1st.\n\n[Judge]Then you tried to get the electricity in your name when?\n\n[Plaintiff]On the 24th.\n\n[Judge]Why so early? Just to be prepared, or were you going to start moving?\n\n[Plaintiff]To turn it on for the first. So I went on the 24th and tried to get it on.\n\n[Judge]And what happened when you got there?\n\n[Plaintiff]They said that I had an old bill.\n\n[Judge]For how much?\n\n[Plaintiff]$4,800.\n\n[Judge]You didn’t know that?\n\n[Plaintiff]It was from my last marriage, and I didn’t need the lights at that time because I was in another town. I moved away from Norwich.\n\n[Judge]So the bill in your ex’s place was still under your name, and he didn’t pay it?\n\n[Plaintiff]No, it was an old bill.\n\n[Judge]Who was responsible for paying it?\n\n[Plaintiff]I was liable for it; it was in my name.\n\n[Judge]How long ago was the bill?\n\n[Plaintiff]About three or four years ago.\n\n[Judge]So what were you doing for electricity in the meantime?\n\n[Plaintiff]My last apartment had utilities included.\n\n[Judge]So you found out about the old bill, and what happened next?\n\n[Plaintiff]I asked her if she could include the electricity in the rent, and I would pay her separately. She said no. Then I asked if my kids’ father could put the electricity in his name until I could pay off my old bill, and she denied that.\n\n[Judge]Why is that fraud?\n\n[Defendant]Because the ex-husband wasn’t going to live in the house. The utility company requires the name on the lease to match the account holder.\n\n[Judge]Do you have any proof of that?\n\n[Defendant]No.\n\n[Judge]I don’t understand why it matters to you who pays the electricity bill, as long as it gets paid.\n\n[Defendant]I was told that only the leaseholder can open an electricity account.\n\n[Judge]Do you have proof of that policy?\n\n[Defendant]No.\n\n[Judge]You don’t have a legitimate reason for denying her the apartment. If she failed to open an account, that would be her problem, not yours. Instead, you pulled the rug out from under her tenancy without proper grounds. You refunded half her money, but you kept $975. On what grounds?\n\n[Defendant’s Son]If she could have opened electricity, she would have done it.\n\n[Judge]No. Your mother bailed, not her. Your mother refused to rent to her.

So, I sold it to someone else.\n\nJUDGE: How much did you sell it for?\n\nDEFENDANT: $500.\n\nJUDGE: Did that person pay you fully?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Plaintiff, you claim the defendant did not fully reimburse you?\n\nPLAINTIFF: That’s right. He only paid me $380.\n\nJUDGE: Defendant, what do you say to that?\n\nDEFENDANT: I paid him three different times—$300, $200, and $100. The first payment was made in front of someone. The last $100 was given at work in front of a supervisor.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have that supervisor here to testify?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have a written statement from them?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have receipts proving you made those payments?\n\nDEFENDANT: No.\n\nJUDGE: Plaintiff, do you have any texts proving he still owed you money?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Let me see those texts.\n\nPLAINTIFF: (Hands over phone)\n\nJUDGE: (Reading messages) On September 28, you texted, \"Yo, defendant, I’ll see you at work. Since you don’t want to answer, I want my money. Can’t sell a car with no brakes. Have my money, or I’ll have your car.\" Then on September 30, you wrote, \"Defendant, what are you going to do? I don’t have time to play games. If I don’t hear from you today, I’m leaving your car at work.\" And then on October 1st, \"When are you going to start giving me my money? If I don’t have it by Monday, I’m filing a lawsuit.\"\n\nFinally, on October 19, defendant, you responded, \"What money?\"\n\nDefendant, you never texted him back saying, \"I already paid you everything.\" You just ignored him.\n\nDEFENDANT: …\n\nJUDGE: Defendant, the burden is on you to prove payment. You have no receipts, no witness statements, and no proof that you paid the full amount.

Alright, for $1,000 for stolen property because, according to you, he stole your scooter, your helmet, and caused you to pay some money in changing locks because your scooter keys were involved. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Well, your honor, on June 8th, me and my friend went to the pawn shop, and I decided to stand outside. When I was standing outside, the defendant was with a girl named Jennifer. Is she in the car? Yes. Is he in the car? Yes. Okay, and you have driven to the pawn shop on your scooter? Yes. What kind of scooter? It was a tow, tow. It was a 49cc. Did you have any pictures of it? No. Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Well, when I was talking to her, the defendant hopped on my scooter and drove off and took off. Took off, stole your scooter right in front of you with someone who can identify him?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Yeah, and she gave me false information about him.\n\nJudge: What false information did she give you?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): She gave me the last name Wilson. Was Wilson ever one of his names for some reason? No.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Do you know Jennifer?\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Who’s Jennifer?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): His friend. Girlfriend or friend?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Friend.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): So at that point, I felt my attention was taken away from the scooter for a reason.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Yeah, you got had.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): So then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): You call the police?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Call the police and then what?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): The police couldn’t really do much.\n\nJudge: Why couldn’t they do much?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Oh, because you didn’t know who the guy was.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Yeah, until—\n\nJudge: But how do you find out who the guy was?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Because I knew his older sister, Erica Saers.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Okay, and I go and tell the cops, and by that time, the defendant was already in jail.\n\nJudge: And then why wasn’t there an arrest?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Because he was already in jail.\n\nJudge: So what then?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): He can be in jail on two things. Why wouldn’t there—like, why didn’t the police follow through? What did they say to you?\n\nPlaintiff’s Dad: Your honor, the detective says we cannot do anything anyway because he’s a juvenile.\n\nJudge: What does that have to do with it? Obviously, things can be done to a juvenile. They’re just done in juvenile court. You still charge them with a crime, and then a judge decides a punishment. There’s juvenile hall. There’s—\n\nPlaintiff’s Dad: Okay, alright, alright, alright, wait, just stop. Just stop. Stop, stop, stop. What’s going on, you H?\n\nDefendant (Ton): Um, the day he said, um, I think he said June 8th, we was with my friend Jenny. He had come to the plaza. We was in talking about he’s selling a scooter. I’m like, how much you selling it for? He like, I want like a thousand. I’ll take eight. I’m like, word. I probably get like 650-700. He like, you know how to ride? I’m like, yeah. He gave me his helmet and the keys and was like, yo, where you going? I’m like, I’m going down to the gas station. Come right back up the street. I gets on, I goes. I’m gone for like 10 minutes. I came back to the plaza. He was gone. I don’t know him.\n\nJudge: Yeah, you know how people are constantly just leaving the plaza after 10 minutes?\n\nDefendant (Ton): I guess my scooter’s not coming back. I’m just going to invest in a 10-minute—not a second more than 10 minutes. Mama, you listening to him?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon’s Dad): Mm-hm. You know this is a load of garbage, right?\n\nDefendant (Ton): Yeah.\n\nJudge: So are parents largely responsible when a kid becomes a criminal? You got a kid here, so I’m going to ask you.\n\nJudge: Yes, they’re completely responsible because from a young age, you have to mold them into the kind of adult that they should be.\n\nJudge: What do you think? Are parents responsible if a kid becomes a criminal?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon’s Dad): Oh yeah, I think so, just ‘cause like they like teach him what they do and stuff.\n\nJudge: Fair enough. What do you think?\n\nPlaintiff’s Son: Yeah, I agree ‘cause like your parent has to teach you how to be, like, proper values and all that, and if they don’t teach you that, you become a criminal.\n\nJudge: Interesting. Okay, very interesting.\n\nJudge: Okay, going inside the courtroom.\n\nPlaintiff’s Dad: He has two scooters, so he wasn’t still my scooter. How’d you get the other two?\n\nDefendant (Ton): I bought them.\n\nPlaintiff’s Dad: In his statement, what he says is buy and sell scooters. That might be a reason to take a scooter so you can sell it. I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but like he said he came back 10 minutes later. He was going, what was he in for? Now fighting, not stealing. He never got arrested for nothing stealing.\n\nDefendant (Ton): So you come back in 10 minutes and the owner of a scooter has forfeited the scooter because you—‘cause he couldn’t wait 10 minutes for a scooter?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): How’d you get home?\n\nDefendant (Ton): My house is directly across the street.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Okay, so he walks home rather than wait for his scooter, and then what?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Where’s the scooter?\n\nDefendant (Ton): It’s gone.\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Is obviously, is going now?\n\nDefendant (Ton): No, it’s not obvious to me, because I don’t live in this fairy tale land. So I don’t know what you’re going to say next. Where did the scooter go?\n\nDefendant (Ton): I’m not sure.\n\nJudge: Well, was it g? The same day, a week later?\n\nDefendant (Ton): It was the next day. I still got his...\n\nJudge: Let’s put ourselves in your clown shoes. And we’re going to come back to the plaza after 10 minutes, and when we come back, the guy who owns the scooter couldn’t wait until minute 11. You then find yourself with a scooter and keys and a helmet, and of course, you call the police to say, listen, there’s a problem. This guy might report his scooter stolen, but actually, he’s just an impatient fellow. So you did that, right?\n\nDefendant (Ton): No.\n\nJudge: And then, according to you, the next day, the scooter’s gone. Probably, was he probably sold it between those two days?\n\nDefendant (Ton): I was in jail.\n\nJudge: How’d you steal it?\n\nDefendant (Ton): Oh, you went to jail.\n\nDefendant (Ton): I just told you.\n\nJudge: Alright, and then you—so you went to jail on day two or the day that you took the scooter?\n\nDefendant (Ton): Day two.\n\nJudge: Day two. Show me the receipts for the scooter. Where was your helmet?\n\nDefendant (Ton): On the scooter handlebars. Yeah, it was attached.\n\nJudge: Show me the receipts for the helmet. The $60 for three deadbolt locks, what is that? Is the house locks?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): You had to change everything once your keys were missing.\n\nJudge: Alright. Let me tell you what’s going to happen, my friends. I’m issuing a judgment in your favor in the exact amount of your losses, which are $999, because I find that the story he’s giving me is completely and totally preposterous.\n\nJudge: That judgment is against Ton, not against his mother, because he’s a grown thief on his own account, and she cannot be held legally responsible for what he does when he’s thieving on his own. Understand?\n\nPlaintiff (Rayon): Yes.\n\nJudge: So that’s dismissed against her. $999 against Ton.

{"id": "978", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. You see the controllers have been sworn. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Okay, Thelma and Leticia, you are suing Stephen Schaffner for $2,800 that he won’t return to you for a vehicle that you bought from him, which you say is junk. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Okay, first, I just want to say I love, love, love your show. I watch it all the time!\n\nJudge: Okay, so honestly, what do you…\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Right, yes. So, on February 27th, I was looking for a car for my mom on Craigslist. I saw this Ford Escape 2004 listed for $3,500. It had 88,000 miles, one owner, in pretty good condition, and the price was negotiable.\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): I called Stephen and asked if we could see the car. I asked if we could go down on the price. He said he wasn’t going down that much but was willing to budge a little. He explained that the car was his son's, in good condition, and that his son went to college, so he didn’t need the car anymore.\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): I went out there, test-drove it for about three blocks, but it was a residential area, so I didn’t go that fast.\n\nJudge: Who was the car for?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): It was for my mom.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t she test-drive it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): She was there, but she trusted my judgment.\n\nJudge: Did she get in the car with you when you were test-driving it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): No, he did.\n\nJudge: And your mom didn’t?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): No, my mom didn’t.\n\nJudge: Is it a two-seater?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): No.\n\nJudge: If it’s her car, how come she didn’t test-drive it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): I always make all the decisions.\n\nJudge: Okay, so which is why I feel bad because I… I know you feel bad.\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Right. So, on the 28th, I added it to my insurance policy.\n\nJudge: Wait, so you agreed on a price?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Yes, $2,800. I tried to get it for $2,750, but he wouldn’t budge, so I paid $2,800.\n\nJudge: That’s down from $3,500?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, so you got a deal. Did you have a mechanic check it out before buying it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: Is there any paperwork from the sale?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): We gave the bill of sale to the motor vehicle department.\n\nJudge: You don’t have a copy of the bill of sale?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): No.\n\nJudge: Do you have a copy of the bill of sale?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): No.\n\nJudge: Do you have a phone?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Yes.\n\nJudge: Do your phones take pictures?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Yes.\n\nJudge: They’re not just for nasty pictures; they’re also for taking pictures of evidence. You should have taken a picture of the bill of sale. Now, I don’t know what it said or the terms of the sale.\n\nJudge: Did he tell you anything besides it runs well?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): He said if there were any problems, we could always bring it back, and he would give us our money back.\n\nJudge: Did you say that?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): No.\n\nJudge: That’s why we want a bill of sale. So, what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Three days later, the check engine light comes on, and it makes a loud rattling noise. I have a video.\n\nJudge: Let’s hear it.\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): (Plays video of loud rattling noise and smoke.)\n\nJudge: Did you take it to a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Yes, Ford said the engine has a knock and to take it back to whoever we bought it from.\n\nJudge: What will it take to repair it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): Stephen called me on March 8th and offered $800.\n\nJudge: Did you know of any issues with the car?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): No, my son was driving it two months before.\n\nJudge: How long did you own it?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): Two years.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you get it checked out before buying it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): I just trusted that it was okay.\n\nJudge: It’s an “as-is” sale. You should have had a mechanic check it out. The law protects commerce; otherwise, every used car sale could lead to lawsuits. When Ford checked it, did they say what needed to be done?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): They said it needed a new engine for $1,600.\n\nJudge: And he offered you $800. Why didn’t you take it?\n\nPlaintiff (Leticia): I felt it wasn’t fair.\n\nJudge: Stephen, why did you offer the $800?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): I felt bad and wanted to compromise.\n\nJudge: Or were you threatened?\n\nDefendant (Stephen): I was threatened. They came to my house, told me they were leaving the car, and the mother yelled she would make my life hell.

You are suing?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nRosa Aona.\n\nDouglas (Plaintiff’s Representative):\nAnd Amir Carpets. You are the owner of Amir Carpets, yes? All right, for $585, the purchase price of a rug that he bought from you. And according to you, he didn’t sign the check, so you weren’t able to actually deposit the check.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nWhoops. Okay, what happened?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nFirst of all, we’re in the auction business. We sell on commission; we don’t own the goods. We had an auction in May of 2011, which was a real-time auction and an online auction. This rug was in an online auction at the end of May. It was available to be seen and inspected before the auction.\n\nJudge:\nWhen was the live auction going to be?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nThe live auction commenced on May 21st.\n\nJudge:\nSo when did he buy this?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nHe bought the carpet May 31st.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so it didn’t sell at the live auction?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nThat’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s correct. And then you kept the items online for auction bids, and he bid?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nHe registered, left us a message, \"I’m interested in buying handmade carpets.\" I know he’s got the rug; we know he got it. But so tell me about the circumstances where you folks accept a check that’s not signed. Is that what happened?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nWhat happened is he came to pick up the rug. He was late. When he came to get the rug, he gave my administrative assistant a check. Apparently, she didn’t look at it. He took the check, which was not signed. We discovered it the next day. My assistant asked me what to do, and I said, \"Please give him a call.\" My assistant went to put—took the check.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s correct?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nThat’s right. She got fired?\n\nJudge:\nNo, she didn’t.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nOkay, go ahead.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nShe’s still with me, but her mother’s ill, and she couldn’t come today.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so I said we’ll give him a call, which she did. He said—she asked him to send another one. He told that he would.\n\nJudge:\nYou have an affidavit from her?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nI do. Can I see it?\n\nJudge:\nWell, it’s not sworn.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nWhy wouldn’t you bring her?\n\nJudge:\nI mean, I heard what you said, but I mean, that’s not the issue.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nWell, no, I’ll—what the issue is—\n\nJudge:\nI understand. May I please see whatever you do have that’s not sworn and not—\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nHer. This is the registration.\n\nJudge:\nWhy wasn’t the check signed, sir?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nI did turn that in when I arrived there. They were rushing me too much.\n\nJudge:\nYou were late?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nI was late. Yes, I was. You know, it was a one-and-a-half-hour drive for me. I asked directions many times.\n\nJudge:\nSo how late were you?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nI was just maybe a couple of minutes. I don’t know.\n\nJudge:\nA couple of minutes?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd according to your assistant, he’s—how—\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nOh, it’s not even signed. Let alone sworn. It’s just a paragraph.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nThe next day, Tom showed me the unsigned check, and I called him to let him know the check was unsigned. He said he would send us a new check by mail, and that you were an hour and a half late, not a few minutes, an hour and a half.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nNo, they close at—I don’t know—5 or 6:00. I was in that town, but all right, so you get there, and what happened?\n\nJudge:\nThey just had the car all wrapped up and just put it in my trunk.\n\nJudge:\nAre you trying to explain why you gave them a check without inspecting the merchandise? Is that what you’re trying to say?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nBecause they were saying that it was late, and the carpet was all wrapped up and whatever. I said that the—\n\nJudge:\nSo why wouldn’t you just unwrap it first?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nOh, it’s too big. Too big. I couldn’t do it myself.\n\nJudge:\nHow long did it take to unwrap it in my courtroom?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nSeven minutes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so why couldn’t it be unwrapped there?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nBecause it was wrapped with the plastic things, and it was tidy and convenient to just move it on down the road, doggy. That’s all. It’s because it was just like—\n\nJudge:\nEverybody’s lazy. And then all of a sudden, look at you now. You got time for all this now. Nobody had seven minutes then. But even though—\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nAll right, so they didn’t tell me about all the damages that this carpet has.\n\nJudge:\nOh, you might have seen it if you unrolled the rug, right?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nBut can I see the online auction pictures? Like, I mean, you bought the rug, okay, from the pictures that were online, right?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nYes.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nAnd so then you bring that rug back to your place, and what is your place?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nIt’s a place that I buy rugs for myself and sell it for my home. I don’t have a store or anything.\n\nJudge:\nYes, okay. But if you look at the back, you can see all the damages and all the—\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nI mean, in the picture, I can see this. There’s some—what is this, by the way?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nIt’s a—uh—I don’t really know. If that’s not my job, we sell these.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nWhat was it advertised as?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nIt was advertised as a large-room-sized oriental carpet, Blue Field, from a Virginia collector. That’s it. That’s all it was advertised as. There wasn’t anything more.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nNo, okay.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how is it not what that says?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nIf you look, you can see all the patches on the carpet that they didn’t see.\n\nJudge:\nPatches on the—on the—?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nI’m not lifting this.\n\nJudge:\nWhat patches on the bottom of the carpet?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nYes. If you—you know, you’re referring to this.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. I mean, all the—even at eBay or other places, other auctions, they disclose all the problems that the merchandise has. Can you—can you flip just—just if you flip this part? I just want to see how it looks on the other end. The receiving end of such a thing is that—\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nHere. That’s the first patch.\n\nJudge:\nYeah. I mean, there’s—you could—I’m looking at the picture, and I can tell that there is some fading in a line right here that is sort of separate and distinct from the kind of stuff I’m looking at, which is patched and holes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat say you to that? Do you feel that when you advertise something, you need to say that it’s patched and that it has actual—\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nWith all due respect—\n\nJudge:\nYeah, that usually—you know what we find as judges when people start a sentence with the phrase \"With all due respect,\" we’re about to get disrespected.\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nThat’s okay.\n\nJudge:\nBut I want you to come over here, though, because I do want you to see this first. I’d like to read first. I’d like you to come over here, please, if you don’t mind. I just want you to see what I’m talking about, rather than just hear what I’m talking about.\n\n[Judge walks over to defendant]\n\nJudge:\nYou see that?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nYes. You’re on.\n\nJudge:\nI mean, that—you know, the question is in a breach of contract case because essentially what this man is saying is that it’s a breach of contract because you advertised a rug and you don’t mention—can I—let me just get you up there a second. Come on.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you, of course, can see these that it’s been patched up, where those holes are, right?\n\nThomas Schwanky (Plaintiff):\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he feels that you folks should have to disclose if you’re selling something that’s been repaired, has a hole, and whatever else, that it’s a little less than forthright if you don’t, and that therefore it’s a breach of contract.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nNumber one, he registered in our auction, and people who register to bid in our auction are responsible for having read the terms and conditions of our sale.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nOkay, we didn’t sell this in a store. It doesn’t come with a guarantee. All goods are sold as is, where is, with all faults, and all sales are final. All auction items are available for bidder examination. Bidding signifies that you have examined an item, either personally or through an authorized agent, or that you have elected not to examine an item.

Press the off button.\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nHand it to my bay. Hand it over to me.\n\nJudge:\nDon’t—what were you going to do? Hit my bay? I do not suggest playing kis maacha with Douglas.\n\nJudge:\nWhat say you to this?\n\nRosa Aona (Defendant):\nActually, I did see that the carpet on the computer. But any place that they—they have to say the damages. Any place that you buy anything—I want to see you. You’re online right now, right?\n\nJudge:\nLike, I know. You just do it.\n\nJudge:\nAnyway.

So we put down a $100 down payment.\n\nJudge: What was the date?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: I think it was the 8th or 9th. We went down on the 6th and drove it back to us.\n\nJudge: So what’s the answer to my question? Did you guys have it inspected by a mechanic before buying an 11-year-old car?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: Not before we purchased it, no.\n\nJudge: Did you have it done afterward?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: I did.\n\nJudge: Oh, a post-purchase inspection. What’s the point of a post-purchase inspection? That’s like having a headache, waiting until it’s over, and then taking some aspirin.\n\nPlaintiff Drew: You’re absolutely right. I mean, it’s my first car.\n\nJudge: Not your first car, Mom?\n\nPlaintiff Dorothy: No, it’s not.\n\nJudge: This is what he relies on you for, though?\n\nPlaintiff Dorothy: Yes, I know.\n\nJudge: Tell me about the whole timing belt thing. Did you discuss it with him?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: We assumed it was a new timing belt as stated in the ad.\n\nJudge: Did he give you paperwork?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: He said he worked at a mechanic shop and did the work himself.\n\nJudge: So you finally took it to a mechanic after a month. What possessed you to do that?\n\nPlaintiff Drew: I wanted to make sure everything was running right.\n\nJudge: So a month later, you get it inspected, and someone tells you it needs $3,200 worth of work?\n\nPlaintiff Dorothy: Yes, and there was a piece of wood wedged in to hold the timing belt tensioner.\n\nJudge: Did they take pictures?\n\nPlaintiff Dorothy: Yes, on a cell phone.\n\nJudge: Let me see that.\n\n(Judge examines the evidence, discusses repair costs, and asks Defendant for proof of work done.)\n\nJudge: Defendant, do you have any proof the timing belt was replaced?\n\nDefendant Anthony: No, I got it done by a neighborhood mechanic.\n\nJudge: An alley mechanic?\n\nDefendant Anthony: Yeah, basically.\n\nJudge: You get what you pay for. There was a piece of wood wedged in the timing belt tensioner.\n\nDefendant Anthony: If I knew that, I wouldn’t have driven it 66 miles.\n\nJudge: The sale of a used car is an \"as-is\" sale unless stated otherwise.

{"id": "603", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Yes.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Mr. Brenson. You’re suing Mr. McGaan for $550 for a damaged headlight and a lost factory bumper that you say happened at his hands. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Okay, let me say first, it’s a pleasure to be here. Thank you. It's a pleasure just to watch you on TV. It’s more of a pleasure just to see you.\n\nJudge: Thank you. You feel the same way, right?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Yes, ma’am.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Again, I knew Frank a long time ago, over five years, and he used to do side work for me, mechanic work. After about the last five years, Frank started getting kind of shy with his work and moving away from people. As a matter of fact, he fixed my headlight on my car, and the headlight turned white from him putting crazy glue on something—Elmer glue or whatever glue he used.\n\nJudge: What happened to your bumper and headlight that you needed him to fix?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Well, I got into an accident previously, and it cracked the corner of my bumper. But it was just a crack. It was something that could be fixed. So, I hired him to replace the bumper from it. I went and bought an off-the-market bumper.\n\nJudge: And so he replaced it?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Yeah, and I left him there about maybe 11:00 p.m. that night. I called him within the hour to tell him, \"Yo, Frank, save my factory bumper for me.\" And he told me, \"Hey, Doug, that’s gone already.\" And I’m saying, \"Within an hour, you gave away my bumper without calling me?\" Okay, and then the next day I come to find the light—the headlight that he put in there—my same headlight that came in my truck. It turned white, and he refused to do anything.\n\nJudge: When did all this happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): It happened at—he did the work at night. It happened in 2009.\n\nJudge: Why did you wait three years?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Because he was running. He was doing so much stuff, taking people’s money, and he got out of the neighborhood. I just couldn’t find him.\n\nJudge: How did you find him now?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I was at a mechanic shop. I needed some more work done, so I went out of my area where I live and went to the mechanic shop to get the work done. I was browsing around, and I looked over and I seen Frank, but he was running for a long time. So, I confronted him and asked him. It turns out he was just in the next town over, not even a mile away.\n\nJudge: A mile away? Your car must not work a lot.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): No, we don’t, but you don’t have to go in that area.\n\nJudge: I understand. But it’s not exactly running. It’s not like he’s a fugitive.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Oh, no. He was running. He was ducking. He wouldn’t get in touch with me.\n\nJudge: How much did you pay him to do the repair?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I paid him $100.\n\nJudge: And when you picked up the car, why didn’t you complain then?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): It was at night, and I didn’t see the white.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you complain the next day?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I tried to talk to Frank numerous times about it. \"Hey Frank, the headlight turned white. Can we do something about it?\" He blew me off. He blew me off, then he got out of the area for years, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): How did you come to sue him now?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I was at a mechanic shop. I needed some more work done, so I went out of my area where I live at and went to the mechanic shop to get the work done. I was browsing around, and I looked over and I seen Frank.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): First of all, I fixed his headlight about two, three years ago. He had an accident. It wasn’t crazy glue. It was glue that we used in the body shop. And I did him a favor in front of my house. It wasn’t at no shop or anything.\n\nJudge: Did he pay you $100?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): No, I never got any money from him. Matter of fact, he still owes me for the brakes he paid me for that he didn’t pay me for.\n\nJudge: And it’s his bumper that’s on the vehicle? The vehicle is in the parking lot?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Yes. He brought the vehicle to the parking lot. The serial numbers on the parts will match the VIN number to the vehicle. So I want to know how that—that’s his headlight.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I had to bring it because the camera wouldn’t take a clear picture because you couldn’t tell.\n\nJudge: Let’s go look at it.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): You never put any tape on the lens.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Wait, wait, wait. Is what they...?\n\nJudge: I want to see the vehicle. And I never put any tape on the lens. Stay... let’s go. You got the key?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Yes.\n\n(They head to look at the vehicle.)\n\nJudge: The plaintiff says the defendant screwed up his headlight repairing his car, but he waited three years to sue. Plus, if the plaintiff was so upset, why did he come back to get other repairs?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): The headlight was already like that before I put the tape on. Where’d you put the glue? If you open the hood, I’ll show you where the glue was. The brackets that hold the headlight in place were broken. He needed a new headlight, but he didn’t have money for a new headlight, so he had me repair that headlight. Did he pay you for the repair? No, he didn’t.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): No, I did not. That’s his original headlight.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Well, you did.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Where is it that you glued it?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Behind the grill, the tabs are all the way down there. So I don’t see how any glue got on this lens.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Why didn’t you just use the hardware you’re supposed to use?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Because he never supplied me any hardware.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): Didn’t my house realize you’re an A1 mechanic?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): You brought it to my shop. I work at a very reputable shop.\n\nJudge: Well then why didn’t you just?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Because he didn’t have the money for that, and how much could it cost to put the hardware? He needed to buy a whole new light. It was broken.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I told him it was a whole new light he needed, but the headlight was my light. You want to see my light?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Come on right now.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait, wait. Stay... I want to see the vehicle.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): No problem. Matter of fact, I will hold the headlight in place, and this is why you need a new headlight.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Gentlemen, hold on.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s go back in.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to the People’s Court. Harvey Levin here. Is waiting three years in a situation like this too long?\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: Well, I think three years is a tough case to try to prove for something of this magnitude. Glue? I mean, three years later, most glue would probably have lost its adhesiveness by then.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): But what about the notion that it created a milky film? Wouldn’t that have shown up three years ago?\n\nJudge: Three years is too long. Definitely too long. I mean, anything could’ve happened. The guy could’ve messed with the lens on his own.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): That’s a good point.\n\nJudge: And you're going to get the last word.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): He probably spilled the milk.\n\nJudge: You spilled milk on it and that’s what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): I know that if there’s anything I know right now, it’s that you feel he did you wrong 100%.\n\nPlaintiff (Douglas Brenson): But your feeling that he did you wrong is not as good as proof. And when you wait three years, you’ve basically lost your proof. You have nothing. You have three years of passage where a million things could have happened.\n\nDefendant (Frank McGaan): No, no. We’re done, Mr. Brinson. We’re done.\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the defendant.

What's the bird doing here?\n\nPlaintiff: The bird is a witness. She was in the car when we developed a series of issues.\n\nJudge: The bird is a witness? Okay, I have seen it all. For real. The bird is—do you feel the bird is a wit—did you swear the bird in? Oh, raise your right wing. Did you put this one, including the bird? Oh, for the love of all that's holy! I thought I had taken the wrong case out. Okay, let's get to it, Mr. Hess.\n\nJudge: Who is she?\n\nPlaintiff: This is my fiancée.\n\nJudge: Was she in the car with you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she was.\n\nJudge: All right, tell me what happened here.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, on February 15th, I brought my truck into Prestige Auto. It was sputtering and having problems driving.\n\nJudge: What kind of truck is this?\n\nPlaintiff: It's a Ford F-150, a 1991.\n\nJudge: Oh wow, it’s in very good condition.\n\nPlaintiff: It’s actually an art car.\n\nJudge: Yes, it’s also old enough to vote. Okay, and—so what does sputtering mean?\n\nPlaintiff: Sputtering means it was having fuel problems. I was pressing the gas, and it wasn’t really going.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I brought it into Prestige Auto. I have dual fuel tanks, and I never use the front tank. I only use the rear tank, and it’s been working that way for ten years. I brought it into Prestige Auto to have them diagnose the problem and fix it.\n\nPlaintiff: They changed the fuel filter. Then they said they wanted to do a full oil change. So I agreed to the oil change and expected the car to work. They gave it back to me the next day, and I drove it. As I'm driving to work on the West Side Highway, it breaks down again.\n\nPlaintiff: So I had them tow it back. Then they said it wasn’t the fuel filter or the fuel lines—it was the fuel pump.\n\nJudge: Well, did they say that, or did they say, “Now your fuel pump went”?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they said it was a fuel pump problem. They never mentioned that anything was wrong with it before the first time I brought it in.\n\nJudge: Did you say to them, “Well, I don’t want to pay extra,” or did you pay that second time?\n\nPlaintiff: I paid both times.\n\nJudge: Right. Okay. So the first time you went in there, what was the repair? What did they do?\n\nDefendant: The first time he came in, he asked us to just replace the fuel filter, do an oil change, and replace the neck for the tank that was not working. Those were his notes.\n\nJudge: Can I see the evidence that he’s telling you how to fix it instead of you telling him what needs doing? Isn’t that customary for you to tell the customer?\n\nDefendant: He just wrote notes when he came in. He said he wanted an oil change, to see if we could fix the tank that was not working.\n\nJudge: What tank was not working?\n\nDefendant: The front one.\n\nJudge: But he doesn’t even use the front.\n\nDefendant: Yes, but he asked us to see if we could put it to work again.\n\nJudge: Did you see if you could put it to work again?\n\nDefendant: We couldn’t because the car is older; most of the parts—\n\nJudge: So what did you charge him for that first time?\n\nDefendant: A fuel filter and an oil change. That’s it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Then he comes back the second time and says what?\n\nDefendant: The second time, he was towed in.\n\nJudge: How long after?\n\nDefendant: Two days later.\n\nJudge: So it was towed in, and what does he say?\n\nDefendant: We checked the car; there was no fuel pressure. We diagnosed that the fuel pump wasn’t working. We called him and told him he needed a fuel pump, and we put it in.\n\nJudge: And then was the car working?\n\nDefendant: The car was working fine, yes.\n\nJudge: How do you test a car to make sure it’s working fine before calling the customer?\n\nDefendant: First, we leave it on the lift to make sure there are no leaks while it’s running. Then we leave it outside for a little bit and take it for a test drive.\n\nJudge: So you pick up the car. How long does the repair last you that second time?\n\nPlaintiff: It lasted until I drove home to pick up my tools, then picked up my fiancée and the birds, and we started driving again. On the Grand Central Parkway, people were screaming at us that something was wrong with our car. We smelled gas. We pulled over, and gas was gushing out of the bottom of our truck.\n\nJudge: Gushing?\n\nPlaintiff: Gushing. We called Prestige Auto, and they said they couldn’t do anything until the morning.\n\nJudge: Did you take it to another mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we did.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything in writing from that mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Did that mechanic say Prestige did something wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, they said the problem was a rubber grommet on the front fuel tank, and they also found a faulty relay valve switch. Prestige should have checked these.\n\nJudge: There’s no evidence that the defendant failed to install a fuel pump correctly or predict another issue with a 20-year-old car.

I found a house on Craigslist that Mr. Clark was renting—a three-bedroom. I liked the house, but the rooms wouldn’t accommodate my bedroom set. I explained that to him, and he told me he had another residence around the corner in the same area, also three bedrooms, but someone was living there at the time.\n\nJudge: So what did you agree on?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): We agreed that I would wait for the other tenants to move out and then take that house.\n\nJudge: Who were you moving in with?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): My 12-year-old son and my 3-year-old niece, who I have custody of.\n\nJudge: You were being assisted by Section 8, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): Yes.\n\nJudge: You saw the house in May?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): Yes.\n\nJudge: And then again in June?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): Yes.\n\nJudge: What happened in June?\n\nPlaintiff (Octavia Fields): We did the inspection, and Section 8 found a couple of issues that needed fixing.\n\nJudge: A list of 22 items they wanted fixed?\n\nDefendant (Henry Clark): 13, actually.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then?\n\nDefendant (Henry Clark): We tried to comply with the list, but it took time. She brought her stuff in because she was upset and had nowhere else to turn. She said she didn’t have money for storage, so I told her, “Go ahead, put it in. I’ll help you out.”\n\nJudge: What did she store?\n\nDefendant (Henry Clark): A 55-inch, $1,500 brand-new TV, plus a whole houseful of contents.

The defendant and his stepdad initially said they’d help fix it, but nothing happened for weeks.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you fix it?\n\nDefendant: I couldn’t get the others to pitch in.\n\nJudge: What’s your plan now?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m suing all four of them separately.\n\nJudge: Why separately?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s easier in small claims court, and I need money to fix my house.\n\nJudge: Your estimates are excessive.

{"id": "591", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant was a provocateur who slammed into her Nissan Maxima. But the defendant says the plaintiff was being overly aggressive because she felt the defendant was simply driving too slow. It’s the case of grody to the maximum. Thank you, Douglas. Delina Claxton?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing Andrew Taylor for $2,781.91 in damages to your car in a car accident you had with him that you say was his fault, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, sir.\n\nJudge: What happened? Come on over here to the board and explain it to me. Pick a car, any car.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, I’m coming up.\n\nJudge: Lexington—no, this is the defendant’s car. Okay, so you’ll be the blue car.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Now, there are two lanes on Lexington going in one direction?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so let’s see what’s going on. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So I got up here, and we were both at the stop sign to see if any traffic was coming from Grand Avenue. There wasn’t, because there was a stop sign. So I proceeded. He said something to me, and I didn’t pay much attention because I was on my way.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait. What did he say to you?\n\nPlaintiff: I really don’t know.\n\nJudge: Had there been a problem? Was there an issue before that between you two?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, not really. He was coming up the block in front of me, and there were people behind the block behind me honking their horns. So I honked my horn as well.\n\nJudge: Ah, okay, so the plot thickens. As you’re driving down Lexington, you’re beeping the horn at him because what? He’s going too slowly?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He was with his girlfriend, and they were chatting and taking their time.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So the person behind me honked their horn, thinking that I was slowing up the traffic. So I honked my horn at him because he was going so slow. When there was any chance for me to pass, I passed him because I knew I—\n\nJudge: So now you’re both at the stop sign. He says something to you, which is probably not nice, but you don’t know what it is?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know what it was.\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: I waited to see if any traffic was coming. I started to make my turn. When I made my turn here, he came behind, made his turn, and smacked me right here.\n\nJudge: So you hit the front of his car or the back of his car?\n\nPlaintiff: The back of his car.\n\nJudge: Is Grand Avenue one way also?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it’s a one-way also.\n\nJudge: Come back to the lectern. Let me hear your version. Come on over.\n\nDefendant: Do you want my whole story?\n\nJudge: Yes, I want your whole story. Start from when you were born.\n\nDefendant: First of all, Lexington is a one-lane street. It’s broad, but there’s no marking down the middle.\n\nJudge: Were cars beeping at you? Agitated cars?\n\nDefendant: The plaintiff was beeping at me.\n\nJudge: Was there another car behind her?\n\nDefendant: I don’t remember. I don’t think so.\n\nJudge: Was there somebody else who passed you angrily?\n\nDefendant: There was someone who turned at the previous intersection.\n\nJudge: Did that person seem frustrated?\n\nDefendant: They seemed like they were in a rush.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happens?\n\nDefendant: Once we were up at the stop sign, I pulled up first. Ms. Claxton passed me in empty parking spaces and pulled up right after me. I drive a 15-passenger van, and from where she was, she couldn’t see if there was any traffic coming. I stopped at the intersection first. I don’t recall shouting anything out the window.\n\nJudge: Did you say anything?\n\nDefendant: I don’t believe I did.\n\nJudge: Did he say anything?\n\nPlaintiff: The windows were up.\n\nJudge: But sometimes you can say something without making your words heard.\n\nDefendant: I think we were like, “What?” because she was trying to pass in parking spaces.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\n\nDefendant: I pulled up to the stop sign first. I looked to my right and saw that there were no cars coming. I made as wide a turn as I possibly could—again, I’m in a large vehicle. I turned, I was about 80% complete with my turn, and at that point, Ms. Claxton attempted to squeeze between a parked car and me. She couldn’t make it and ended up driving into the left rear wheel well of my car.\n\nJudge: Who has pictures? You want to step back? Okay. Let me ask you a question: after you hit each other, what does everybody say?\n\nDefendant: I got out and attempted to exchange information.\n\nJudge: What’s the first thing you say to each other?\n\nDefendant: I said, \"Don’t say anything. Let’s exchange information, call the police, and that’s it.\"\n\nPlaintiff: He wasn’t doing anything! He didn’t even call the cops!\n\nJudge: I find the accident was your fault.

It’s the case of \"I got some tea for you.\" Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Carrie Boylan, you are suing Desiree McGee for $4,885.51 that you say you are out after an accident that she had with your— is this your son?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he was driving the car.\n\nJudge: Come front and center. I don’t know why you’re sitting down. Okay, you weren’t in the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nPlaintiff’s Son: I was driving one of our friends home, and I was going past the side street. I had the right of way. I had no stop sign. She came out, she hit me pretty decent, put a hole in my door. I called my mom first, and she said the cops were on the way already.\n\nJudge: When you say a hole in your door, what do you mean? Is there a picture?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, these are all the pictures.\n\nJudge: Were you hurt?\n\nPlaintiff’s Son: No, I went to the hospital for tightness, a back problem, and they said it was just tight muscles.\n\nJudge: Did you hear screeching of brakes or anything?\n\nPlaintiff’s Son: Nope. I didn’t know somebody was actually going to hit me until somebody said, \"Oh! Oh!\" Yeah.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: I was driving. I had my phone on one of those clips on the dashboard, and it fell underneath my foot.\n\nJudge: Why was it on a clip on the dashboard?\n\nDefendant: Like, I use it for my GPS and stuff, so I don’t touch it. Like, it doesn’t roam around, but it fell down, and it fell underneath my foot, under the pedal. So, I took my foot off the gas and slowed down to try to grab it. When I looked up, there was a stop sign. I did stop, and we did hit each other.\n\nJudge: It’s not the best time to go grab your phone.\n\nDefendant: Well, if I were to try to, you know, hit the pedal and it was underneath the pedal, I wouldn’t have been able to stop anyway. You know what I mean? Like, if a water bottle had fallen underneath your car, like, your pedal—\n\nJudge: That wouldn’t happen to me.\n\nDefendant: Well—\n\nJudge: You know why it wouldn’t happen to me? Because the phone wouldn’t be that important for me to continue to drive and not look at what’s happening when I’m about to approach a stop sign. You T-boned somebody because your attention was diverted to go pick up the phone you dropped. So it became his problem. You didn’t just crash into a tree and make it only your problem. You made it his problem by crashing into him. That’s if that’s what was happening, as opposed to that you were texting.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: No? So, if you grab your phone as you’re driving and you get in an accident, are you automatically responsible for that accident?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Because? There’s a word for it. What’s the word for it?\n\nDefendant: Be responsible?\n\nJudge: No. What’s the word for it? You are a blank driver.\n\nDefendant: Drunk?\n\nJudge: No.\n\nDefendant: Reckless?\n\nJudge: No. Distracted. Really good.\n\nJudge: Were you hurt?\n\nDefendant: No, I was not hurt.\n\nJudge: Okay, you’re very lucky nobody was killed. Now, insurance pays off the car. You are upside down on the car, right? Which is what happens when you finance a car. So, you’re asking that she— after the insurance has already paid you— her insurance has already paid you the value of the car, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: That’s what you’re entitled to in a court of law. And if it turns out that you owe more than what the value is, that’s just too bad for you. You’re suing so that she has to pay not just the value of what she damaged but also $2,750 because you don’t want to have to put a down payment on a new car.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. I had four years left on my loan. I wasn’t looking for a new car.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I know, but you also didn’t have to pay off four years of a loan. The damage was paid off by the insurance company by paying off the car. So, you can’t then say, \"Oh, by the way, buy me a new car too.\" No, that’s not how it works.\n\nJudge: The next thing you’re suing for is lost wages for three days of work. Tell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff: I had to take time off from work to take him to the doctor’s, physical therapy, and to come here today.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of your wages?\n\nPlaintiff: His pay stub.\n\nJudge: Did the police come to the site?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Anybody get arrested? Nothing like that, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Nope.\n\nJudge: You think she was driving drunk?\n\nPlaintiff: She seemed out of sorts.\n\nJudge: Maybe because it was an accident? Did the officer suspect anything?\n\nPlaintiff: I told the officer. He said he didn’t suspect anything and just left it at that.\n\nJudge: Verdict for the defendant.

{"id": "75", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Ms. Rachel Miles, you are suing Mr. Levi Gaston for $1,643.54 in damages to your car. You say the damage occurred when roofing material from his home fell upon it. Is that correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, your honor, on December 16th, 2011, I went out to my car—I was on my way to work—and there was some debris on my back trunk.\n\n**Judge:** What kind of car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A 2002 Dodge Neon.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I took the debris off and put some of it in the front yard. Then, I proceeded to work.\n\n**Judge:** What did you think when you saw it? Did you know where it had come from?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh, yes. Yes.\n\n**Judge:** How did you know?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because we had some debris in our driveway before from his roofing.\n\n**Judge:** When did you have debris in your driveway before from his roofing?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I don’t know the exact date, but when it gets real windy outside—\n\n**Judge:** Have you ever brought it to his attention?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** How come? But when it gets real windy, that implies it’s happened more than once before. I’m curious, because you never mentioned that in your complaint.\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I didn’t.\n\n**Judge:** You’d think you’d mention it, right? Especially to him, if it happened multiple times before—that he needs to do something about his roof. You’re not just trying to make your case better, are you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, ma’am, I’m not.\n\n**Judge:** How often has that happened before?\n\n**Plaintiff:** About three other times.\n\n**Judge:** Three other times during the course of how long a time?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A couple of years or more.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Also, the debris that was in the driveway before—it also damaged my landlord’s automobile, and she lives upstairs from me. And Mr. Gaston knows about that.\n\n**Judge:** Oh? Tell me about that, Mr. Gaston. Do you?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I agree with her.\n\n**Judge:** You do?\n\n**Defendant:** Okay.\n\n**Judge:** All right. Good, because I was getting nervous that maybe you were trying to make your case better.\n\n**Defendant:** To be honest, ma’am, I think that was four years ago.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Once I got to work, it was daylight.\n\n**Judge:** Had there been high winds the day before?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Once I got to work and it was daylight, I noticed a lot of scratches on the car. When I got out of work, I went over to Mr. Gaston’s residence, but he wasn’t there. His son was there. I wrote down my number and asked his son to tell him to call me. I never heard from Mr. Gaston at all.\n\n**Judge:** When was this?\n\n**Plaintiff:** January 23rd, 2012.\n\n**Judge:** Did you ever make contact with him and talk to him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That was on the 23rd.\n\n**Judge:** When you did talk to him, what did you two talk about?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Once he heard the estimate—the first estimate—he didn’t want to hear the second estimate. He just said, \"I’m not paying it. That’s an act of God.\"\n\n**Plaintiff:** The debris I put in the front yard—I would think Mr. Gaston did pick that up. Wouldn’t he think, \"Hey, it’s time for me to get my roof fixed?\" But he didn’t.\n\n**Judge:** What’s going on with your roof, Mr. Gaston?\n\n**Defendant:** I agree with everything she says, except that I went to see my son—haven’t been home in years—I don’t know who she spoke to, but I didn’t get the message.\n\n**Defendant:** I did go around to the house because I rent the house and go there every week, twice a week, to check on it.\n\n**Defendant:** I have a couple of roof issues.\n\n**Judge:** Is this his roof?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, that’s his roof.\n\n**Defendant:** I told her, \"Let’s get an estimate for the car, then we’ll see.\" When she came up with $1,600, I said, \"Gee, I got my whole car painted for $1,600.\"\n\n**Judge:** But apparently, lots of pieces of roof come off your house.\n\n**Judge:** Your roof is supposed to withstand normal weather conditions.\n\n**Judge:** What I’m going to do—I’m ordering you to pay the cheaper estimate, which is $1,335.

Okay, I was behind here. I had my turn signal on because I saw other trucks coming this way, leaving the ferry. So, this truck started merging into the right lane here. Uh-huh, it went over there. Okay, so I had my turn signal. I was going to go over there anyway because I wanted to go around him, right? So, as he got over here, now I got over here behind him. She came up behind me, okay? After we were going down the road, she came around me and got right there and started gesturing to me. I don’t know what she was saying. She just started gesturing, and all of a sudden, I looked back, and looking on the back of my truck, I thought somebody blew off like a bucket or a rag, you know, stuff from fishing, but I had everything pretty secure. All of a sudden, she bam, ran into me right there, and I slid down this hill, was gone. So, I hit the BR, I didn’t know, I was in shock, it just shocked me. So, as I was in shock, she, my friend, she rolled down the window, and I said, “You just hit me.” She said, “No, you just hit me,” and fled, and yeah, took off, fled. I tried to catch her, she was on the phone with 911. 911 told me to stop chasing them. So, I’m all shook up now. I’m mad, and I’m furious. So, I pull over on the side of the road, and after we get out and look at the damage of the truck, my back in my truck, B, so I bent the back out as much as I could, but by that time, a lady pulled up behind me in a Mustang and asked me, “Well, are we all right?” She witnessed the whole thing, really. She was more shook up than we were, okay? And she stood there for about 20 minutes waiting on the police. I had to call them three times for them to get out there to the scene, and when they got out there, she had given her name and number, who had the—the witness. Okay, she gave him her name and number. Thank God she did. She got a tag number. She did, she did. ‘Cause I was trying to catch up with her to get her tag number. 911 already told me to stop chasing, right? It’s probably good advice to stop. You don’t want to—oh wait, we could have caused another accident. Alright, so you speak to the police, and is there a police report?\n\nPlaintiff (John Mitchell):\nYes, ma’am. I ended up getting that Monday. I had the other one, but it didn’t give me full detail, but that one did. Is this the friend who was in the car?\n\nJudge:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nCome on up.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nWell, she, we was going down the road like he said, and so then she came up to the side of the truck and wanted me to roll the window down.\n\nJudge:\nSo what, you’re traveling at what speed?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nAbout 40-45 miles.\n\nJudge:\nRoll down the window and chit-chat?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nYeah.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nSo you’re just going to ignore it?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nOkay, so we kept on going. So after a while, she just, what’s—after a while, how much? A minute or two?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nShe just plowed into us on purpose.\n\nJudge:\nA minute or two is 120 seconds, was it that long?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nIt didn’t take that long. I just said a minute or two, but she hit us on purpose.\n\nJudge:\nOn purpose?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nYeah, and then so after she hit us, we stopped, and then she said, “I bet you’ll let that—I bet you’ll let it down now,” and she took off.\n\nJudge:\nHow? Wait, she said what?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nStop. She said, “I bet you’ll let that window down now,” and that’s when she told him that he hit her.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nAnd he said, “No, you hit me,” and then she just took off.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened? Can I show you?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nYeah, come on up. Okay, since he’s using this as his truck, I don’t know about who was in front of him. We’re like way back here, I guess this is the road that’s supposed to be coming out of Blunt Island. Okay, so the two of you were not on a feeder lane going into that road? It becomes—extra drive turns into where Blunt Island merges into hex drive. I don’t know what they’re called. I just want to know if you had been on the road for a while, or if you were on a feeder road.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nWe had been on Hextra Drive for a minute, me and this gentleman.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nOkay, but where everything happened was around the Blunt Island terminal. So, he’s in this lane. I’m in this lane. I immediately get over.\n\nJudge:\nWhy are you getting over?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nBecause it’s the normal thing I do when I drive down that road coming from the beach. We go there all the time.\n\nJudge:\nNo, but why are you getting into the left lane?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nIn order to achieve what?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nTo be able to pass, just to be able to go and pass all the craziness in that one lane.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and just prior to this accident, which is probably his witness, um, was a Mustang that had been following me speeding, and I had to get her off of my rear end.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how did you get her off of your rear end?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nI had to pass somebody to get her off my rear end, ‘cause she was just staying on my rear end, and she didn’t have enough space to get in, go around both of the vehicles that were in front of her, me and another vehicle. So I had already gotten around her. Then we get to this point where he’s at, where we’re at.\n\nJudge:\nWho’s in the car with you?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nMy daughters, both of my daughters, and my cousin from South Dakota.\n\nJudge:\nHow old are your daughters?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nMy youngest one is 13, and she has autism. My oldest one is 15, and my cousin is 22.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. But, um, needless to say, I was already committed to this lane. This gentleman started coming over. There was no turn signal on the back of his truck indicating that’s what he was doing. I started blaring on my horn to try to make him aware that he was coming into my lane and about hit me.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nHe just kept coming. He ignored it like he didn’t hear it. I don’t know if he’s deaf or what—partially deaf, but I was laying on my horn. I had to slam on brakes and swerve to keep from hitting him.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so that’s why.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nNow, put him in front of me. Now he’s in front of me, got it.\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nAnd I pull up beside him. But this is where I’m at at this point—after this situation. After I realized I got over here to catch up, just back up, okay, as that happened, my horn was hitting there and it seemed...      Plaintiff's Friend:\n...hitting there and it seemed like he wasn't responding. After this, I realized, okay, he finally got behind me.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so now you’re behind him. What happens next?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nSo, now we're behind him, and I saw him weaving in and out of the lane. He was kind of swerving, and I was thinking, \"What in the world is he doing?\" Then, out of nowhere, he slams on his brakes. I had to stop suddenly, and that’s when I thought we were going to hit him. But we avoided that collision. But as we continued down the road, that's when she came around me, gestured, and then hit us.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you’re saying the defendant's actions were reckless and dangerous, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nAbsolutely, your Honor. It felt like she was purposely trying to cause a situation. We weren’t doing anything to provoke her.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so the defendant comes around and hits you. How do you react?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend:\nWell, after the collision, we stopped immediately, and I tried to see if everyone was okay. Then, that’s when she said, “I bet you’ll let the window down now,” and then she took off. I was in shock, but the whole situation was just crazy.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah, I was mad. I was already trying to get her tag number, but she was speeding off. I had no choice but to stop, and luckily, the witness showed up and gave us her information, which helped us track down her car.\n\nJudge:\nSo, let me make sure I understand. You were behind her, she was driving recklessly, weaving in and out, and then suddenly hit you. After that, she took off, but a witness was able to provide useful details about the incident. Is that right?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, exactly.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, Michelle Fay, you’re being accused of crashing into the plaintiff’s vehicle, leaving the scene of the accident, and causing significant damage. What do you have to say about this?\n\nDefendant (Michelle Fay):\nWell, Your Honor, that’s not exactly what happened. Yes, there was a situation on the road, but I wasn’t trying to hit anyone. In fact, I was trying to avoid getting into an accident myself. This guy was driving recklessly, swerving around, and I had to take action. As for the collision, it wasn’t intentional at all. It was just a mistake. I didn’t leave the scene on purpose—I was just scared and didn’t know what to do.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re saying the collision was accidental?\n\nDefendant (Michelle Fay):\nYes, absolutely. I didn’t mean to hit anyone, but he made an aggressive move, and I had no choice but to try to avoid him.\n\nJudge:\nBut you did leave the scene, didn’t you? After the accident, you didn’t stop to exchange information or check on the plaintiff’s condition.\n\nDefendant (Michelle Fay):\nI understand that it looks bad, but I was really scared. I didn’t think it would escalate like this. I was just trying to get out of the situation.\n\nJudge:\nI see. So you’re claiming it was all out of fear and not intentional. What do you say about the witness’s testimony? She’s confirmed the incident and provided the police with your tag number.\n\nDefendant (Michelle Fay):\nI can’t speak to what the witness saw, but I know I wasn’t trying to hurt anyone. I’ve been driving for a long time, and this was just a very unfortunate situation. I am sorry it happened, but I don’t think I should be held fully responsible for all the damages.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, we’ll consider everything and look at the evidence.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization, Deflection, Evasion, Emotional Appeal"}
{"id": "897", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please rise. Be seated. Come to order, please. Litigants have been sworn, your honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Daniel Petron?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your honor.\n\nJudge: How do you pronounce it? The way I did?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Very good. All right. You are suing Connor Lucas for $3,500 that you say you loaned to him and he has refused to repay. Now, my understanding is that you were dating Mr. Lucas’s girlfriend’s mom?\n\nPlaintiff: Not dating, your honor. No, just a friend. She helped me out about five years ago.\n\nJudge: Okay. How? Financially or some other way?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no, I was very sick, and she helped take care of me sometimes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Um, who are you?\n\nDefendant’s Girlfriend: I’m his girlfriend, and my mom—\n\nJudge: This is your mom? I—you know, I wasn’t sure. And how old are you?\n\nDefendant’s Girlfriend: 21.\n\nJudge: How old are you?\n\nDefendant: 20.\n\nJudge: Lord above. All right. So what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: The mother calls me and says to me that they tried to get some money to help get a second car for Connor’s girlfriend, Mary. So I said okay. They couldn't get the funds from somewhere else, so she asked if I could help. I said, “All right, let me talk to your daughter. Let me feel her out a little bit and let me see what’s going on.”\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So she called me, we talked on the phone. I said, “How much do you need to get a second car and everything?” And she says, “Probably about $4,000.” And I went, “Oh, okay. I didn’t expect that.” But I said, “Let me see what I can do.” See, the difference between you and me is if I had a 20-year-old telling me, who I’d never met—did you know her, or you didn’t know her?\n\nJudge: Did you know her?\n\nPlaintiff: I knew her just for a little bit.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So if a 20-year-old I barely knew asked me for $4,000 for a car, I’d be like, um, no. I’ve gotten beaten up by my family, friends, everything else. It’s just the way I am.\n\nJudge: But why did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: I did it for the mother because she did help me, and I really thought that getting these young kids a second car would really help them out a lot.\n\nJudge: Seriously?\n\nPlaintiff: It did.\n\nJudge: The person it didn’t help was you because, according to you, that was a loan. That’s how you were helping them out—giving them a loan.\n\nPlaintiff: Absolutely.\n\nJudge: And according to you, Mr. Lucas, what?\n\nDefendant: Well, our assumption was that it was a gift because—well, the reason we accepted was because we weren’t in a position to pay anything. We are very paycheck to paycheck.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: We have a little girl.\n\nJudge: How old?\n\nDefendant: Three years old.\n\nJudge: Who’s how old?\n\nDefendant: Three.\n\nJudge: Oh, for the love of God.\n\nDefendant: So we really aren’t in a position—\n\nJudge: Right, you are the kind of people we call bus takers, or public transportation takers, right? You don’t get to have the $4,000 car until you’ve saved up for it, right?\n\nDefendant: Uh—\n\nJudge: Or you have to drop a—You know, that’s the kind of thing it is.\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: And so when—it’s not—I’m not sure why you would think a virtual stranger was going to rain four grand on you.\n\n(Commercial Break)\n\nJudge: Well, was there any discussion about when the payback would be?\n\nPlaintiff: Your honor, I—I—I had to go to the bank Monday. They didn’t know that I had to go borrow the money to cover a check if he wrote it out.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t even have the money?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: You took it out of what?\n\nPlaintiff: My home equity.\n\nJudge: You put your house up as collateral?\n\nPlaintiff: I had to borrow the money.\n\nJudge: Okay. Who are those folks?\n\nPlaintiff: These are my sister and her husband.\n\nJudge: Oh, they must have been the ones who gave you the most grief. Because they have a bobblehead going while I’m talking—the two of them. All right. So let me—listen, there are worse things, right? So let me ask you a question. When you wrote the check, did you have them sign a promissory note or anything else?\n\nPlaintiff: We were at breakfast. I took them out for breakfast on a Sunday morning.\n\nJudge: You paid?\n\nPlaintiff: Of course, I did, your honor. I paid.\n\nJudge: They know what a nice person you are.\n\nPlaintiff: I know. Listen, kids—he was sitting right next to me, Mary was across with her daughter, we were having breakfast. I took the check out of my pocket, and I handed it to him. And I said, “Listen, you better make sure you look at the check before you fill it out and cash it.” And that was the last of the conversation.\n\nJudge: And on that check, in the memo line, you had written “Personal Loan for Kids.”\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your honor.\n\nJudge: And you had left the payee blank because you didn’t know if he was going to sign it to himself or to an auto agency?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s exactly right.\n\nJudge: And as it turns out, you wrote it to yourself, right? Like, you filled your name in and then you got the money out. And what’d you do with the money?\n\nDefendant: Well, the money was deposited into my bank account, and then once we found a vehicle—\n\nJudge: You did buy a car?\n\nDefendant: We did buy a car.\n\nJudge: Yeah? How’s that working out for you?\n\nDefendant: Very well.\n\nJudge: Good. Yeah, of course. So did you not read the memo line?\n\nDefendant: No, your honor. I filled the check out in the car.\n\nJudge: Because where you fill out your name with your hand is a half-inch from the memo line. What did the memo line say?\n\nDefendant: I—I do not remember.\n\nJudge: Okay, you’re 21. You’re not blind. What did the memo line say?\n\nDefendant: I don’t recall.\n\nJudge: The memo line said “Personal Loan.” What would make you think it was ever going to be a gift? Did you ever say it was going to be a gift? Did the word loan or payment plan or anything like that come up at breakfast?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Months later—months—months later, you say, “Hey, you ever going to pay me back for that?” And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: They thought it was a gift.\n\nJudge: And you said?\n\nPlaintiff: What?!       Judge: So, according to you, this was a loan. And according to you, this was a gift. Now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Lucas. If someone gives you $3,500, wouldn't you at least ask, \"Are you sure?\"\n\nDefendant: We assumed that because there was no discussion about repayment, it was meant to help us out.\n\nJudge: Right. But common sense tells you that a stranger isn’t just going to give you that kind of money with no strings attached. Did you ever think to clarify?\n\nDefendant: Well, we just went with what we understood at the time.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh. Let me ask you this—when the plaintiff asked you to pay him back, what did you say?\n\nDefendant: I told him we were struggling financially, and that we wouldn’t be able to pay him back.\n\nJudge: Okay. But did you say, \"Oh, I thought this was a gift,\" or did you just say you couldn’t pay him back?\n\nDefendant: At first, I told him we didn’t have the money. And later, when he kept asking, I said that I believed it was a gift.\n\nJudge: And you never thought to call him and say, \"Hey, we’re really grateful for this—what are the terms of this?\"\n\nDefendant: We just assumed.\n\nJudge: Right. You just assumed the best-case scenario for yourself. You know what that sounds like to me? Convenient.\n\nDefendant: I understand, your honor.\n\nJudge: Now, Mr. Petron, I understand you didn’t have a contract, but you do have a check that clearly states “Personal Loan for Kids” in the memo. That is evidence of intent. It’s not ironclad, but it’s strong. You also asked for repayment, which further supports that this was not a gift.\n\nDefendant: But we genuinely believed—\n\nJudge: No, no, no. I don’t believe that. I believe that you took the money, spent it, and then when you realized there were consequences, you backpedaled and decided it was a gift. But the law doesn’t work that way.\n\nDefendant’s Girlfriend: Your honor, if I may—\n\nJudge: No, you may not. Your boyfriend accepted the check, deposited it, and benefited from it. If you wanted to clarify, you should have done that at the time.\n\nDefendant’s Girlfriend: But we—\n\nJudge: No “but.” You’re young, you’re struggling, and I get it, but that doesn’t make it right to take advantage of someone’s kindness.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you, your honor.\n\nJudge: Here’s my ruling. Mr. Petron, you made a very bad decision in giving this money without an ironclad contract. That being said, there is enough evidence to support your claim that this was a loan. I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of $3,500.\n\nDefendant: But your honor—\n\nJudge: Case dismissed.

{"id": "857", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Lorna Lewis. She says the defendant, her upstairs neighbor, has been harassing her mercilessly. He calls her every dirty name under the sun, bangs on her door at all hours of the day and night, and makes obscene gestures—disgusting ones—toward her. She was forced to move away and is suing this terrible man for the $2,400 she's owed for harassment.\n\nThis is the defendant, Tommy Thompson. He says he's the one being harassed by the plaintiff. She has cut off his hot water, maced him for no reason, and she grows pot plants. She’s the instigator. He’s not giving her a penny, and that’s that. He’s accused of starting up with a neighbor. All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\n**Bailiff:** Litigants have been sworn, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Lorna Lewis, you are suing your upstairs neighbor, Tommy Thompson, for $2,400 for harassment. Tell me what's going on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I moved into the unit in July—July 28, 2015. By then, there was a lady named Andrea living above me. Mr. Thompson used to go off on her and her sons, and then it gradually worked its way downstairs to me. Especially when she moved—I became the focus. Um, Mr. Thompson is an alcoholic. He gets drunk, and he starts being very, very belligerent.\n\nI've been called tramps, sluts, yellow hammers—I can't figure out what that one is. Up until June of this year, it had been an on-and-off thing, but I don’t know what triggered him this year. There was another man living above me—Tony. He ran him away with the same thing, and I have a statement from Tony. Now that I’m the only one left...\n\n**Judge:** Does he own the place?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, he does not.\n\n**Judge:** So why doesn’t the landlord get rid of him and keep all of you guys? What’s going on?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, I have a statement from the landlord. He says that being cursed out is no reason to evict a tenant.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Like I said, I don’t know how we got back to him cursing me out and making obscene sexual gestures toward me.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, we got you.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have videos of that.\n\n**Judge:** So why’d you stay there? If you were month-to-month, why didn’t you want to get out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I’m on Section 8. I like where I live. I thought the owner would work with me on this, but then he finally sent me a message that made me say, “You know what? You’re not going to help me. I’m going to go ahead and move.”\n\nNow, when you're on Section 8, you can't just get up and move. It’s a process. I’ve done everything—I turn in my keys tomorrow.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, you do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. I moved my belongings out Sunday because after the obscene sexual gestures, I was like, “Okay, this is escalating.” There’s no comparison to peace.\n\n**Judge:** What’s the problem, Mr. Thompson? What’s going on?\n\n**Defendant:** Some of the statements that she said are true.\n\n**Judge:** Such as?\n\n**Defendant:** She said the gesture I made, cussing her out—that happened. But she cussed me too. It’s not just me by myself. Then she says the next-door neighbor, Tony—he didn’t just move. He got evicted. The sheriff came out and served papers on him because he wasn’t paying rent.\n\n**Judge:** That’s right. They served papers on him.\n\n**Defendant:** She said she was renting the backyard of the five units that are there, and the landlord said no. He said a portion, but she takes up at least three-fourths of a 15-by-45-foot-long backyard.\n\n**Judge:** Did the landlord make her take it down?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, because she moved out.\n\n**Judge:** According to her, she’s staying at her boyfriend’s. Is it because she can’t stand living there because you won’t stop harassing her?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s not true. She’s there every night since she moved out and before then.\n\n**Judge:** What seems to be the problem between the two of you?\n\n**Defendant:** She plays her music loud, so when I play mine, she hollers upstairs, bangs on the door, and tells me to cut my music down.\n\n**Judge:** What kind of music does she play?\n\n**Defendant:** Regular music.\n\n**Judge:** What kind of music do you play?\n\n**Defendant:** I play reggae, all kinds—Bobby, everything.\n\n**Judge:** According to you, she’s growing marijuana plants in the backyard?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, taller than me, and I’m 6’3”. I got the police report on that.\n\n**Judge:** Let me see that.\n\n**Defendant:** And I got another report—she maced me.\n\n**Judge:** She maced you with spray? When did that happen?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes. When she was harassing me.\n\n**Judge:** How many times were the police out there? Are you just showing me police reports because you kept calling them?\n\n**Defendant:** I called when she was harassing me. She says it’s just me, but she’s doing the same thing.\n\n**Judge:** What do the reports say? Did they find a marijuana tree?\n\n**Defendant:** No crime—it’s legal to have in Los Angeles.\n\n**Judge:** Did you spray mace at him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I never sprayed mace at him.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Let’s see the video.\n\n[Video plays]\n\n**Judge:** Why are you yelling those things and making those gestures?\n\n**Defendant:** Because she was saying things about me needing a woman.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. I think you’ve both proven that you have been harassing each other. Miss Lewis, I understand that you wanted a forum where someone listened to you because you felt the police and the landlord weren’t. But this is a difficult case. You’re asking for $2,400, but both of you are guilty of inappropriate behavior. I’m not awarding damages to either party.

Her employee had an in with the airline, so the plaintiff should be going after her if there were any problems with the flights. The plaintiff called the cops on her for no good reason. She runs an excellent travel agency, and the angry plaintiff is suing the wrong person. She's accused of taking off on a former friend.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nWelcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff used the defendant's travel agency to book a trip, but the defendant used a fraudulent credit card. Now, the plaintiff is in trouble with the airline. The defendant says she was just the middleman, so not her problem. It’s the case of have lawsuit, will travel.\n\nThank you, Douglas.\n\nMiss House, you are suing Danielle Williams and Miss Danny’s Travel—that’s your company?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. You are suing for $1,114.51 in lost wages and an airline ticket that you had to pay twice for. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, um, basically, I was trying to book a trip for my anniversary. The defendant had told me—\n\nJudge:\nHow did you guys know each other?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh, we've known each other for years. We lived down the street from each other. We grew up on the same block. As we got older, we moved, and we kind of lost touch. Then, we ended up living in the same area again in the last three years. So, from that point, we kind of talked a little bit more than we had in years past.\n\nI have a daycare. I had her children in my daycare for about a year. The following year, it just didn’t work out because of time restraints and her trying to, you know, um, um, trying to get me to go to a certain price that I wasn’t willing to accept for my services. So, um, with that being said, we just kind of didn’t really talk as much.\n\nBut over the years, she started telling me about her travel agency.\n\nJudge:\nSo you decide to use her for a trip to—?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, the Dominican Republic.\n\nJudge:\nYou and your spouse decide that it’s a great idea. You go on it. What goes wrong during the trip?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh, everything.\n\nJudge:\nWell, first, tell me what went wrong with the flights before the trip.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh, it was horrible. We booked the trip on the 11th, and by the 13th, we already had an issue with the flight.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the issue?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI got an email saying the flight had been cancelled. But before that, I had actually received a confirmation that we were going on a flight that wasn’t the one we originally agreed to. It had a long layover. So, I reached out to her and said, “I didn’t want a layover; we don’t want to be sitting somewhere for two and a half hours.” She told me, “That’s not the flight I originally booked. Let me fix it.”\n\nIn the process of her fixing it, she said it got cancelled.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, but that cancellation sounds normal. She was canceling that flight because it wasn’t the one you wanted. But why would a flight have surfaced that wasn’t the one you picked?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause I was dealing with a— It was like a third-party transaction. I had a person at the airport.\n\nJudge:\nWho is the she? An employee of yours?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, she’s just an associate.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe next flight gets cancelled.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did the second one get cancelled?\n\nDefendant:\nThat was not what I told her, but, um, the second one got cancelled. The person at the airport told me it was something with the flights to the Dominican Republic—something about the group.\n\nJudge:\nSo, it wasn’t the airline cancelling flights—it was the transaction that got cancelled?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nThen it’s not something with the trip; it’s something with your methods. Normally, this shouldn’t happen, right? People shouldn’t have their trips cancelled multiple times?\n\nDefendant:\nRight, and that’s exactly what I was saying to my person who was booking the flight.\n\nJudge:\nSomething shady is going on here. What is it? I need to know.\n\nDefendant:\nI wasn’t aware of it at first, but later, I found out my associate was using inappropriate credit cards.\n\nJudge:\nA stolen card?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but at the time, I didn’t know.\n\nJudge:\nSo, let’s fast-forward. You go on the trip. You get to the resort. What happens?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI have no confirmation number. I call her. She doesn’t answer. The resort can’t find our reservation. It takes three hours to get a room.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what about the excursions?\n\nPlaintiff’s Spouse:\nThey were horrible. Our names weren’t on the lists. The driver never showed up to take us to the club.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so the trip is a disaster. You get home. What happens next?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI get an email from Southwest's fraud department.\n\nJudge:\nWhy was the fraud department contacting her?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause my associate was using fraudulent credit cards.\n\nJudge:\nShe paid you how much for the ticket?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$520. Then, I had to pay Southwest again—$834.51.\n\nJudge:\nWhy wouldn’t Southwest go after the agency?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey said they go after the passenger because we got the benefit of the flight.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you think you shouldn’t be responsible?\n\nDefendant:\nI wasn’t given the chance to fix it. I would have fixed it.\n\nJudge:\nBut fixing it would have meant paying the $834, right?\n\nDefendant:\nI would have figured out a way.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. I’m finding in the plaintiff’s favor for $834.51. However, I am not awarding lost wages.\n\nVerdict for the plaintiff.\n\nPost-Verdict Interviews\nReporter:\nMiss Williams, are you surprised by the judge’s decision?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, not at all. It’s business. I get it.\n\nReporter:\nMiss House, you’re getting your money back. Thoughts?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI would never do business with her again. She is not a friend.

{"id": "217", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Next case, in the matter of the Plaintiff, Sandra Kwar, who is suing the Defendant, Dr. Ronald Juvas, a dentist, for dentures, claiming they do not fit. The Defendant states that he has been practicing for 37 years and believes the dentures are properly made. It is the case of the dentist who broke the mold.\n\nJudge: Thank you. You're welcome. Sandra Kwar?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing your dentist, Ronald Juvas, for $1,567, the amount you paid for dentures that you say do not fit.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I joined a dental plan back in January of 2011, and the Defendant was a participant on the plan. I contacted him because his location was close to where I live and work. On my first visit, we discussed the dentures and the price. I told him I have a very small mouth and asked if he could make the new dentures the same size as my current ones. He said no problem. That would never be a problem. But unfortunately, they are not.\n\nJudge: Did you bring him the dentures you were wearing?\n\nPlaintiff: I was wearing them.\n\nJudge: So, he took them out and looked at them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I assume he did a mold of my mouth. He did two impressions, which he said was his standard practice to ensure accuracy. However, I feel the mold he used was too large for my mouth. When he took it out after the plaster settled, it did not seem correct.\n\nJudge: What happened when you received the dentures?\n\nPlaintiff: I went back at least five times. Each time, I told him I couldn’t wear them. He filed them down, but they were still too thick. The gum part was thicker than my previous dentures. He kept insisting I would adjust, but I couldn't. I felt like I had a mouthful of marbles. I was gagging when I ate, and there was no room for food in my mouth. My jaw didn’t close properly.\n\nJudge: Did he acknowledge the issue?\n\nPlaintiff: He said they were only off by two or three millimeters, which he claimed was within an acceptable range. But even a small difference in the mouth feels exaggerated. He kept saying I would adjust, but I never could.\n\nJudge: Did you ever ask for your money back?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because I felt it would have been a dead issue. He was convinced he had made a perfect set of dentures.\n\nJudge: Do you have the dentures he made?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. What prompted me to do something about it now, a year later, is that I ran into a nurse who used to work in his office. She asked if I could wear the dentures. I told her no, and she said she never liked the forms he used to take impressions.\n\nJudge: Can I see those dentures? Did you get new ones made by someone else?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I am still wearing my old ones.\n\nJudge: Okay. These are in a plastic bag. The ones with the red are the new ones?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I also brought my old set for comparison.\n\nJudge: Doctor, what’s going on?\n\nDefendant: I followed all proper procedures, using the guidelines I teach at my residency program and the ADA recommendations. The Plaintiff came back for adjustments, which is normal. Dentures take time to adapt to.\n\nJudge: How many times did she come back for adjustments?\n\nDefendant: Five times.\n\nJudge: In your answer to the complaint, you stated that she never complained about the dentures. Yet, she came back five times for adjustments. How is that possible?\n\nDefendant: When fabricating dentures, there are many variables, including jaw size and a patient’s tolerance for change. Patients who have had prior dentures are the most difficult because they get used to their old ones, even if they are not in the proper position.\n\nJudge: These dentures are much bigger. Why?\n\nDefendant: When a patient has a lack of bone, we try to maximize retention. Adjusting too much too soon can create long-term instability.\n\nJudge: Could you have done something different?\n\nDefendant: I could have used a tissue conditioner, which is a gel-like material that adjusts to muscle movements. But she never asked for it.\n\nJudge: Could you still fix them now?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but she hasn’t worn them in over a year, and tissue changes over time.\n\nJudge: Courts in recess.\n\n(After recess)\n\nJudge: She came back five times, and they still don’t fit. Should she get her money back?\n\nDefendant: There are still adjustments that can be made.\n\nJudge: But she has not gone to another dentist. That makes it hard for me to determine whether the dentures were improperly made or if she simply cannot adjust to new ones. There’s no independent verification that these are defective.\n\nJudge: Are you willing to make further adjustments?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but she must be willing to go through the process without wearing her old dentures during that time.\n\nJudge: On your lawsuit to recover the full price of the dentures, I rule in favor of the Defendant. The original contract and guarantee still stand. You have the option to return to the Defendant for adjustments.\n\nJudge: That is my verdict.

The louse of all louses hasn’t, and he's here seeking a rightful payment of the $650 he's rightfully owed.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Jennifer Kingston. She says the plaintiff is trying to scam her, and she's not the type to be scammed. She paid him 500 bucks for the move—the price he quoted her. After the move, he tried hitting her up for an additional $150. The guy's been harassing her ever since, and she just wants to get rid of him from her life and move on after the judge rules in her favor.\n\nJudge: She’s accused of trying to pull a nonpayment move on a mover.\n\nJudge: All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case in the docket: the plaintiff was hired to move the defendant into her apartment, and she stiffed him. But the defendant says she paid the guy 500 bucks, and he's a scammer.

You say she owes you for a move, right? What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, well, um, November 3rd, I moved her from one apartment to another.\n\nJudge: How long have you been in business?\n\nPlaintiff: Couple years.\n\nJudge: What's a couple years? One or twenty?\n\nPlaintiff: Two.\n\nJudge: Two? Okay. And how many employees do you have?\n\nPlaintiff: Two.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you did a move, and you were recommended to her by whom?\n\nPlaintiff: I had moved her sister before.\n\nJudge: And that went fine?\n\nPlaintiff: Yep, went fine.\n\nJudge: Right. So you were moving her from one apartment to another?\n\nPlaintiff: To another.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And she had told me it was a smaller move than it was. And so when we started loading, she said, \"Oh, I have a big storage unit downstairs,\" which was probably 15 by 15 or something.\n\nJudge: So, total boxes and furniture?\n\nPlaintiff: So, we, uh... uh... So I told her, \"You know, this is more than you said. I'm going to have to charge you more.\"\n\nJudge: This is before you're loading the stuff in?\n\nPlaintiff: She says, \"That's fine.\"\n\nJudge: Exactly what did you agree on for the amount?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, she agreed—$150 more.\n\nJudge: $150.\n\nPlaintiff: So during the move—the $500 move—she tells you, \"Oh, I have a storage unit filled with boxes.\"\n\nJudge: So then, during that, you two agree for another $150?\n\nPlaintiff: $150.\n\nJudge: All right. Do you have any contracts in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don't.\n\nJudge: Have you ever made contracts?\n\nPlaintiff: I mean, I've been an antique dealer for 40 years, and, uh...\n\nJudge: That's different.\n\nPlaintiff: Never had any problem.\n\nJudge: No, but you understand that is a completely different animal than this.\n\nPlaintiff: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: So then, when you got all done, she says what?\n\nPlaintiff: She says, \"Oh, I must have packed my wallet.\"\n\nJudge: You know how we're always doing that—packing our wallets, taping them up in boxes?\n\nJudge: That did not strike you as complete garbage?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, yes, it did.\n\nJudge: So she says?\n\nPlaintiff: \"My check didn’t clear.\" Her paycheck, I think it was.\n\nJudge: And?\n\nPlaintiff: But Monday... Now, I have a lot of text messages between us.\n\nJudge: And according to you, she has paid you nothing?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. Paid me absolutely nothing.\n\nJudge: Nothing.\n\nJudge: What is going on? Let me hear from you.\n\nDefendant: We spent time on the phone. I explained to him I have a two-bedroom apartment. Went through, told him all the furniture. So he quoted me 500 over the phone, and then we confirmed the day before. He showed up with his two workers. They did move me, and at the end, he called me outside. One of his workers was using my bathroom, and the other one was in my living room talking to my mom and my sister.\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.\n\nDefendant: I handed over the $500 in cash.\n\nJudge: Who handed it over?\n\nDefendant: I did.\n\nJudge: To him?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Where’s your receipt?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t get one.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant: Because after I gave him the $500, he came back. We agreed that I would give him the additional 150, ‘cause I wasn’t expecting it.\n\nJudge: Back up. Back up. Back up. Because you missed where you had agreed to give him 150. So you’re still back at the first agreement.\n\nJudge: How does it come about that you agree you're going to give him an additional 150?\n\nDefendant: So, he had moved a bunch of boxes out of my living room into the hallway. And then Ron sat down on a box and said, \"You know, this is really more than we anticipated. And in order to move you, we need another 150.\"\n\nJudge: And you agreed?\n\nDefendant: I felt I needed to agree because, at that point, the way I was feeling from the way he was discussing it was that he wasn’t going to continue moving me if I didn’t agree.\n\nJudge: Did you say that? Did you say, \"Well, I don’t think I should have to pay another 150; it is what I told you it would be?\"\n\nDefendant: I didn’t have any discussions with him, or... I just said, \"Yeah, you’re right. Here’s another 150.\"\n\nJudge: Well, in my head, essentially, yeah, I guess so.\n\nJudge: Okay.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): What happened? Oh, good morning.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): I want to tell a short story about the dentist and me. I am 76 years old.\n\nJudge: Wow.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): And I've never, sorry, you look great.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Thank you. Thank you. And I have never had a tooth pulled without being sedated due to the fact that, since a child, I've always been afraid of the dentist, which I have gone to dentists before. But I met the nice gentleman, Mr. Ben Levy, and I explained my story to him, and I felt very good with him taking care of me. We used to laugh, which I am an outgoing person, and he really was good at first with me, maybe almost to the end with me, and I felt good with him. So, I met him, and I have, he first made these dentures.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Okay, okay, these dentures right here.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): But they couldn't fit my mouth because they hurt with the hardness. So I said, \"Could you, could you—?\" He says, \"U Miss Thornton, I could make you some that made, I guess, this is plastic, that didn't hurt my gums,\" right? So I agree with him. He made the top and the bottom. Well, the bottom never fit, and he says, \"You need a root canal.\"\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Me being afraid, and really, it went well when he put the root canal in.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Who did the root canal?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Dr. Ben Levy.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): You did it?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): I did.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Right. Now the teeth weren’t fitting right.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): No, this was before the root canal was done.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): So he sent me to a lab. He wouldn’t take them back anymore. He made me go to the lab.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Okay. So, well, he made them the first time. They didn’t fit. Did you make a second pair?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): What we did for her, she wasn’t happy with the bottom one. I took the denture away, I sent it to the lab. The lab made a new one. She wasn’t happy with that one either.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Okay, so that was the second one, and you weren’t happy with that one either?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): So, what I recommended to her, I said, \"I understand that you’re not happy with this. Why don’t you go to the lab yourself? Explain whatever you don’t like about this denture to the lab so there shouldn’t be any miscommunication.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Who does that? I mean, I’ve never heard of anybody putting the patient in touch directly with the lab.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Why would the lab even talk to her in your honor?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Sometimes in the, in the...\n\nJudge: Did you let the lab know she was coming?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yeah, you did.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): They charged me for that.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): They charged you?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): No, they charged me for that. It’s not for free. They charge for that.\n\nJudge: They charge you or they charge her?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): No, they charged me.\n\nJudge: Okay, so she goes and... Did you go to the lab?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): And what did the lab tell you?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Okay, it was a cold night in the snow. I paid $50 to go to Flushing, New York, to this lab. I met the man and he said just what you said. He said he didn’t do too much work for this dentist. He said, \"But since you came all the way out here, I will help you.\" So he said, \"You need to go back and do another impression with the thing.\" Right?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): But see, the impression is the impression, and he sends the impression in and then they make it based on the impression. Did your, did something change in her bottom teeth?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): No.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Were any of the root canals in her bottom teeth?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): No, no.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): It was just a repair, okay?\n\nJudge: All right, well, what she said... You ended up having to go to a new dentist, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes, I just started with him this year, as a matter of fact. I'm still in with him.\n\nJudge: And did you ever get those root canals?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yeah. Oh, let me tell you about the root canal. Oh, D. So, he, I said, \"You know, I'm afraid of these needles,\" and he was really good. Now I got these root canals. He did one. Then I think... 'cause you had to pay, if you didn’t pay, you don’t get it. So I went. So, he did the root canal. We went through that. He says, \"Oh, you did good.\" I said, \"Thank you, I did.\" My other root canal.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Okay, so now this... I know how it happened, because he, the lab man told me, and this... he used the old crown. I don’t know what you're talking about.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): And the thing, the crown that came out of my mouth...\n\nJudge: Here’s my one of them.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Were your root canals... You have a crown in your hand?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yeah, okay. Hold on.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): The root canals that you did were on your uppers, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: And the crown ends up... the root canals happened when? What month and year?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): 2014.\n\nJudge: And when those root canals happened, she already has the dentures?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yes.\n\nJudge: And then, of course, the dentures are going to fit differently when crowns are in there?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yeah, but we didn’t make the crown then.

At some point, you folks break up. Like a...\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Can I say something?\n\nJudge: Tell me about the breakup, doctor.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): She came to me with her daughter, and she told me that this—the daughter that’s my daughter... Come on up, heard me complaining. She's really sweet lady. He's nasty. They came together, and she said that I'm going through this, I'm not happy with my denture. And I said, \"I understand that you're not happy with your denture. What I'm going to do, I'm going to give you a refund for whatever you paid for your dentures. You find another dentist, because I'm working with this lab. I don’t have another lab, and you’re the only patient that has problems with the denture.

Did you have... what’s that, a release?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yeah, she signed a release and the copy of the check.

I don’t remember.\n\nJudge: You know what I’m talking about when we talk about a release?\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yes.\n\nJudge: It’s a release from the doctor’s office.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): Yes, it’s a release from the doctor’s office.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you understand what a release is?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes.\n\nJudge: Well, she signed a release, took the $1,200, and then ran to court and sued them anyway.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): No, it’s not about that. It’s exactly what you did.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): What he said to me, he said, \"I'm going to give you your money back because I’m sick.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: You want to see it?\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): I know it is.

He lied. He threw it at me.\n\nJudge: No, no. There's no throwing. There’s a very lengthy release.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): It’s not about the money. I'm 76, and if I don’t have a dollar now, I will never get one.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): But it’s not about that.\n\nJudge: When you sign a release like that to get the $1,200, I have no choice.\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): I gave her her denture. I said, \"I want you to find another dentist.\"\n\nDefendant (Dr. Sherwin Ben Levy): If you go to a store and you don’t like the shoes, you just return them and go buy another pair. I didn’t even get her dentures back because I couldn’t send them back to the lab and get some money.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): I didn’t even get my money back.\n\nJudge: You paid for two root canals, too, and didn’t fully pay for them.\n\nPlaintiff (Victoria Thornton): Yes.\n\nJudge: We’re done, folks.

What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff:\nUm, well, I was moving from the Bronx to Manhattan, and I—I couldn’t fit two TVs in my new home, so I asked him if he wanted to buy the TV off of me.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you know him?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI’ve known him since I was a kid. We grew up together.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he agreed to buy the TV for $500?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and what kind of TV was this?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt was a 56-inch TV.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he offered to buy it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, um, he—yes, for $500.\n\nJudge:\nAnd it was how old?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA year old.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you bought the TV?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you paid how much?\n\nDefendant:\n$300.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and was the purchase price $500?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I guess we both know why we’re here. And so what happened? Why didn’t you finish paying?\n\nDefendant:\nThe temp agency I worked for at the time—the contract didn’t renew with the state, so I was laid off.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and when did that happen?\n\nDefendant:\nJuly 31st of… 2012.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and did you call her and tell her that and try to—?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, he didn’t.\n\nJudge:\nWhat efforts did you make to pay her on a payment plan to finish up the amount? You have a problem—you have a debt. The debt is due, and you didn’t pay it. How did you handle your problem?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, I kept in contact with her. I let her know at this time I wasn’t able to pay. My mother even tried to, you know, step in and say, “You know what? When my money comes through, I’ll be able to give it to you.”\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and did she?\n\nDefendant:\nMy mother’s up in age, so by the time it came around, her money was looking—you know, like she couldn’t help.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant:\nSo she tried to let her know that.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you’re still watching the TV?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, not actually, because I put the TV in the living room—I don’t use it.\n\nJudge:\nOh, so you didn’t even need the TV you can’t afford?\n\nDefendant:\nSo… she’s right.\n\nJudge:\nGot me.\n\nDefendant:\nI let her know, and she also let her know. She still became, you know, upset. She started being agitated, started calling me, calling my mother, using profanity.\n\nJudge:\nSo I just told her, “Look, I don’t like the way you do business.”\n\nJudge:\nOh, she doesn’t like the way you do business either.\n\nDefendant:\nSo I’d rather you just—\n\nJudge:\nHandle it like what?\n\nDefendant:\nGo through that way—go through with your mother, and that way we can just handle it like that.\n\nJudge:\nHandle it like what? Court?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, handle the payments through that way.\n\nJudge:\nThrough which way? I’m sorry.\n\nDefendant:\nHer mother.\n\nJudge:\nHer mother. Okay. And who’s your mother?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat didn’t even go like that. That didn’t even go like that.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI tried to compromise with him. He didn’t want to compromise. He cursed me out, he threatened me.\n\nJudge:\nThreatened you how?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me I was going to get beat up.\n\nJudge:\nHe owed you $200, and he was going to get you beat up?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nBecause? What was he mad at?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause he didn’t want to pay me.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI don’t know.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s not fair to me. He already knows my situation, that I need the money.\n\nJudge:\nDid you folks end up fighting or anything?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. But according to you, he sent his nephew to your place?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHis nephew kicked my door in.\n\nJudge:\nHow do you know that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause I know the nephew. I looked through the peephole.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he kicked your door in, and did what?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe just was kicking it.\n\nJudge:\nDid he do any damage?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, just a little dent.\n\nJudge:\nAnd did you call him and say, “Why’d you send your nephew?”\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe just sent me to voicemail. He never answered the phone. He just—he just doesn’t want to talk. And I just got tired—I needed help, and I came here to get help.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, well, I’m going to give you help.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nYou came to the right place.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Coercion, Deflection, Minimization Evasion, "}
{"id": "44", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Okay, Ms. Marcado, you are suing Mr. Reel's restaurant. You've asked us not to mention the name of the restaurant. We will respect that. You are suing for $1,853.29 in hospital bills and a refund of a dinner bill because you got food served to you that you had explained to them you were allergic to. What happened here?\n\n**Plaintiff:** We went to dinner, my son and three of his friends, to celebrate one of his friend's birthdays. I’m a widow, I have a young son, so I tell them clearly I am deathly allergic to peppers.\n\n**Judge:** How old is your son?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He’s 17.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, but I'm assuming you would take care of yourself regardless of his age.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, absolutely. I’m very cautious.\n\n**Judge:** What are you allergic to?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Peppers. Any kind of peppers—red or green, doesn’t matter.\n\n**Judge:** How did you first find out you were allergic?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I had an asthma attack and I went into shock.\n\n**Judge:** How old were you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** 18.\n\n**Judge:** Had you eaten peppers before that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I’m Italian, so I grew up eating them.\n\n**Judge:** I feel so bad for you because they’re in everything. I don’t even know how you go out to dinner.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s very difficult. I have to be honest. But I always tell the waitress, and she was very nice. She went in and asked the chef if what I was ordering would have peppers. She came back and said no. So they served me my food.\n\n**Judge:** What did you order?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I ordered a fried fish dish. It had one clam with breading on it. I took a bite of the clam, and there was a red pepper. As soon as it hit my tongue, my throat started to close and I went into shock. The night manager, Nancy, came over and said to me, \"Well, the chef told me there are no peppers. Are you trying to get out of the meal?\" I said, \"We didn’t even eat.\" She made me go through the clam and put them in her hand to show her that there were red peppers in there.\n\n**Judge:** Were they crushed red pepper flakes or actual red pepper pieces?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Actual red pepper pieces. I dug them out for her and put them in her hand. She said, \"Oh, well, the chef is sorry. He made a mistake.\"\n\n**Judge:** Did she go back and talk to the chef?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She came back and said that.\n\n**Judge:** In the meantime, what did your son do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He ran to get my EpiPen from the car. I left it in the car.\n\n**Judge:** Did you take your injection?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, and as I was walking out, Nancy was standing there with the bill in the folder. She said, \"You need to pay your bill.\" I said, \"Are you serious?\"\n\n**Judge:** Were you walking out with all the boys?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And she still made you pay the bill?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. She said, \"What do you want? I took your meal off.\" I said, \"The kids didn’t even get to eat. We ruined his birthday dinner, and now I’m on the way to the hospital.\" So I paid the bill and left.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Reel, let me hear from you.\n\n**Defendant:** I was cooking that night. The waitress came to the back and asked if there was any red pepper in the dinner. I said no. I interpreted that as she didn’t like spicy food. She never mentioned all peppers.\n\n**Judge:** Did your waitress ask about red peppers or all peppers?\n\n**Defendant:** She asked about red peppers.\n\n**Judge:** Did you say red peppers or all peppers to her?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I said red and green peppers. And there were red peppers. I handed them to her.\n\n**Judge:** It sounds like maybe this was a miscommunication. But she actually went to the hospital. You know that’s not made up, right?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Can I see your hospital bill?\n\n**Plaintiff:** (Hands over bill)\n\n**Judge:** You comped her meal, that was great. And you paid for two EpiPens. On what theory should she have to be out $1,700 in hospital costs?\n\n**Defendant:** We just felt that if she had stated \"all peppers,\" we would have—\n\n**Judge:** Hold on. Did you state \"all peppers\"?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** You’re not there. Someone conveyed it to you, and you didn’t verify. You’re not going to win on that.\n\n**Defendant:** We did our best.\n\n**Judge:** You fought refunding the dinner for the others?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, because they don’t have an allergy.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Nobody ate their meal. We had three bites and left.\n\n**Judge:** I don’t see how anyone could have continued eating after watching her use an EpiPen and leave for the hospital. I order the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for her hospital bill and refund the dinner. Verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,853.29.\n\n**Defendant:** I’m glad it went that way. It’s fine.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, deflection, persuasion"}

Next case on the docket—the plaintiffs say the plaintiff bought a car, a VW Jetta, from the defendant that was supposedly in \"Superman condition,\" and it was anything but. The defendant says the plaintiffs didn’t complain for months. It’s the case of \"Cool Your Jetta.\"\n\nPlaintiff?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou are suing the defendant?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nFor $3,284.67 that you say the defendant owes you for things that have gone wrong with the car you bought. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nMy son answered an ad on September 4, 2011.\n\nJUDGE:\nWhy don’t you tell me that part since it’s your car? How old are you?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI’m 18 now. I was 17 when I answered the ad.\n\nJUDGE:\nThis is your first car?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYeah, I just really wanted a car.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou were buying it with your money?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYeah, it was my money.\n\nJUDGE:\nHow’d you make the money?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI worked on a goat farm all summer.\n\nJUDGE:\nSlaved on a goat farm! It sounded perfectly medieval in the complaint—he was a slave on a goat farm.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nAnd also at the goat farm—it’s kind of a cool little gig.\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI found the ad on Craigslist. I was looking for a really long time for a car, and I saw this. It said it had a new timing belt, which was the main reason I was looking at it, because that’s a huge cost. It had 156,000 miles, and I thought everything was just good with it. So I called the seller up that night…\n\nJUDGE:\nWhat year is the car?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nIt’s a 2001.\n\nJUDGE:\nLet me see the ad. This is the actual ad you responded to?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYeah.\n\nJUDGE:\n(Reads ad) 2001 Volkswagen Jetta, 5-speed, black, 1.8T… What does that mean?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nIt’s a 1.8-liter engine with a turbo.\n\nJUDGE:\nOh, so it’s souped up?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nIt was pretty nice.\n\nJUDGE:\nBlack with black leather, 156,000 miles, power sunroof, power everything, super mint, new timing belt, water pump, tensioner, tune-up, clean title in hand. Okay. So you go see the car, and you like it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYep.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid you take it for an inspection?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nWe actually put a down payment on the car when we went down there.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid you have it inspected before buying an 11-year-old car?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNot before we purchased it, no.\n\nJUDGE:\nOh, but you had it done after you purchased it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI did.\n\nJUDGE:\nA post-purchase inspection! That’s how you put it in the complaint, right? What’s the point of a post-purchase inspection? It’s like having a headache, waiting until it’s over, and then taking some aspirin.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYou’re absolutely right.\n\nJUDGE:\nIt’s his first car. Not your first, though, right?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo, it’s not.\n\nJUDGE:\nThis is what he relies on you for.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI know.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo in any event, tell me about the whole timing belt thing. Did you discuss it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nWe just assumed it was a new timing belt, as stated in the ad.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid the defendant give you paperwork on it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nNo. The defendant said he worked at a mechanic shop.\n\nJUDGE:\nSo the defendant tells you it’s been replaced, but doesn’t have paperwork because he did the work himself?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nRight.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd a month later, you take it in for an inspection?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes, just to make sure everything was okay.\n\nJUDGE:\nAnd someone tells you it needs $3,200 worth of work?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nAnd they found a piece of wood wedged in to hold the timing belt tensioner.\n\nJUDGE:\nDid they take pictures?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes, on a cell phone.\n\nJUDGE:\nI’ve got to see that.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over the phone.)\n\nJUDGE:\nHow big was the piece of wood?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nI didn’t see it in person.\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay, so you spent $1,958 to fix it?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\nJUDGE:\nDo you have proof?\n\nPLAINTIFF:\nYes.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over a receipt.)\n\nJUDGE:\nDefendant, what’s going on?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI didn’t do the work myself. I sent it to a neighborhood mechanic.\n\nJUDGE:\nAn alley mechanic?\n\nDEFENDANT:\nBasically.\n\nJUDGE:\nYou get what you pay for.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nIf I knew there was a piece of wood in there, I wouldn’t have driven the car 66 miles!\n\nJUDGE:\nBut you advertised it as having a new timing belt.\n\nDEFENDANT:\nI didn’t know about the wood.\n\nJUDGE:\nOkay. So the plaintiffs say the car was advertised in \"Superman condition.\"\n\nDEFENDANT:\nThat’s just a general description.\n\nJUDGE:\nWell, let me tell you something.

{"id": "642", "dialogue": "Judge: Tyler Henshaw, yes? You are suing George Nation for $1,396.60 in rent, utilities, and keys you say he stole from you. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I agreed to move into my apartment with my roommate, Albert Adalus, and he was moving to California for the summer for an internship opportunity. George Nation and I agreed to have him move in for the summer.\n\nJudge: Sort of sublet it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, correct.\n\nJudge: Do you know George Nation?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we were friends.\n\nJudge: You were friends. Alright, and then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: So, we moved in.\n\nJudge: When did he move in?\n\nPlaintiff: On moving day with us.\n\nJudge: With who?\n\nPlaintiff: Me and Albert. He stayed on the couch for a couple of days before he moved back to New York to fly to California. Everything was fine.\n\nJudge: How much was he supposed to pay you? What was the agreement?\n\nPlaintiff: It was $350 for rent when rent is $1,145, which I have proof of.\n\nJudge: So that was a good deal.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, plus $100 flat rate for utilities.\n\nJudge: Now, according to you, the negotiated rate was $100 per month for utilities and $350 for rent?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I started asking more seriously, kind of like, \"We have to get it together.\" I fronted it at the beginning.\n\nJudge: When did you start asking him? He had been there how long?\n\nPlaintiff: I would say three to four weeks.\n\nJudge: But you know, rent usually comes at the beginning of the month, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, we moved in on the 14th, so we had a prorated amount that was already covered.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, so I started asking George for the money. Excuses came up. I got, \"My father pays for it, so he doesn’t have to.\"\n\nJudge: What do you mean, \"your father pays for it, so he doesn’t have to\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, my father is helping me out with rent.\n\nJudge: And he would say to you?\n\nPlaintiff: \"Oh, what do you care? You’re not even paying it.\"\n\nJudge: Really?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you didn’t kick him out then?\n\nPlaintiff: No, we were friends. We still went out. I kind of just put it to the side.\n\nJudge: So what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He started moving his stuff out. I ended up taking his PlayStation 3 as collateral.\n\nJudge: Wait, wait. Does he know that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: At that point, he had lived there how long rent-free?\n\nPlaintiff: Just over two months.\n\nJudge: And what was he saying to you about the rent money at this point?\n\nPlaintiff: After the PlayStation, he said, \"I’m not paying it,\" cursed at me, and other things.\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nPlaintiff: Four or five days later, he knocked on the door. I opened it, and then we had the argument about the PlayStation.\n\nJudge: You have an argument there, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He was angry, of course, like any reasonable person would be. And from there, he left. We ended up texting back and forth. I texted him. He took some things as collateral from me.\n\nJudge: Collateral? That’s called theft, not collateral.\n\nPlaintiff: Well—\n\nJudge: What did he take?\n\nPlaintiff: A smaller wallet with a couple of cards in it. Plus, I realized my backup car keys were missing a few weeks later.\n\nJudge: (To Defendant) What’s going on?\n\nDefendant: Well, what happened was I had a job.\n\nJudge: Are you guys students?\n\nPlaintiff & Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Where?\n\nPlaintiff: University of Hartford.\n\nJudge: What are you studying?\n\nPlaintiff: Communication and advertising.\n\nJudge: What are you studying?\n\nDefendant: Double majoring in accounting and engineering.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nDefendant: I got a job opening for the summer and needed a place to stay. I told him I wouldn’t be able to really pay much. I’m a college student, I don’t have that much money.\n\nJudge: Wait, are you saying you weren’t supposed to pay any rent?\n\nDefendant: No, that’s not what I’m saying at all.\n\nJudge: What are you saying? How much rent were you supposed to pay?\n\nDefendant: We didn’t come to a set agreement at all.\n\nJudge: Were you ever privy to communications between them about the rent?\n\nWitness: Yes, I witnessed a discussion when we moved in that they had agreed upon $350 a month plus $100 for utilities.\n\nJudge: (To Defendant) What say you about that?\n\nDefendant: That is not true. There was no agreement, and he was not present during anything.\n\nJudge: So, according to you, you want me to believe that you were allowed to move in with no commitment about rent?\n\nDefendant: I made no commitment.\n\nJudge: You understand how stupid that sounds? First, you say you’re supposed to pay rent but with no set amount. Then you say you’re not supposed to pay rent but just help with groceries. Then you say you lost wages from an accident and should \"call it even.\" You’re not making any sense.\n\nPlaintiff: (Provides texts about missing items)\n\nJudge: Your evidence on the key is too thin. However, I am awarding you more than you’re asking for on the rent. I am ordering three months of rent at $350 per month, totaling $1,050. As for utilities, three months at $100, totaling $300. Judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $1,350.\n\nDefendant: (Leaving) It went the wrong way, but it is what it is.\n\nReporter: Did you think you were entitled to a free ride?\n\nDefendant: That’s not exactly what I was trying to say.\n\nPlaintiff: I will not choose a roommate who won’t pay rent again.\n\nJudge: Case closed.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Playing the victim, Gaslighting, Minimization, Deflection"}

Is this suspicious to you?\nPlaintiff (Elena): Yes, definitely. She’s lying. I think it was towed because she was parked illegally.\nJudge: How does that affect your credibility?\nPlaintiff: It ruins it.\nDefendant: I didn’t park illegally, but yes, I wasn’t parked in a proper space.\nJudge: So, when you go outside and it’s gone, what happens?\nDefendant: I called 911, and they told me it was too early to file a stolen car report. They said it was probably towed.\nJudge: And then what happened?\nDefendant: I called again, and they said my car was picked up by the sheriff's department.\nJudge: Wait, were the Marshals or sheriffs involved?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: It wasn’t stolen?\nDefendant: No, it was picked up for illegal parking.\nJudge: So, you're telling me that some mystery person was driving your car and crashed it, but it wasn’t you?\nDefendant: Yes, that’s what happened.\nJudge: Why didn’t you file a stolen car report right away?\nDefendant: I didn’t know what to do. I thought it was a misunderstanding.\nJudge: I find it suspicious that there’s no stolen car report until later.\nPlaintiff: Exactly. If my car was stolen, I’d report it immediately.\nJudge: Lacy, why didn’t you report it immediately?\nDefendant: I didn’t know what happened until later.\nJudge: The police report and the way things happened lead me to believe that you were involved in the accident. You didn’t file a stolen car report, and your story doesn’t add up.\nJudge: I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff for $2,500, the Blue Book value of your car.\"", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, minimization, deflection"}
{"id": "678", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff put a deposit down on a room and less than a day later changed her mind, wants her money back, but the defendant says deposits are deposits. It’s the case of \"Let’s Get a Room.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nBailiff: You’re welcome.\n\nJudge: Kristen, you are suing Kevin. Neither of you want your last names used. You’re suing for $700, a security deposit that you put down that he won’t return to you. Yes?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I was walking down the block with my brother-in-law and we saw the \"For Rent\" sign. It said $650 for large rooms. I didn’t call him that same night, so I waited till the next day. I gave him a call and I said I was interested in looking into the apartment. We came that same day and I was in desperate need, so I’m like, you know what? The walls weren’t completely painted, there was no railing going up the stairs, and when I walked up, it was a little shaky on the railing upstairs. And I asked him, I said, you know, how are we going to work out fixing up the apartment?\n\nJudge: Did you take the apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: Well, you didn’t move in, but did you sign anything?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I just—\n\nJudge: Did you hand over a deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How much of a deposit did you hand over?\n\nPlaintiff: $700.\n\nJudge: What was the purpose of handing over the deposit? You told him, \"I’ll take it\"?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him that I wanted him to hold it so I could decide if I could afford it.\n\nJudge: Your story is very different than that, correct?\n\nDefendant: A little bit different. From my understanding, she had agreed to take the apartment. When someone hands you over money, a deposit to hold an apartment, that means they’re going to take it, and she agreed that she was going to pay the remaining balance for the first and last month on the day she moved in, which would have been the first.\n\nJudge: So what ends up happening? You change your mind?\n\nPlaintiff: I talked to my boss and I asked him if I could get more hours and if we could work it out so I could afford the apartment. I asked Kevin if he could lower the rent because it said—\n\nJudge: After you gave him the $700?\n\nPlaintiff: No, before. Before it was said. He said—\n\nJudge: Just tell me what happened after you gave him $700.\n\nPlaintiff: I gave it to him and I told him that I’d give him a call back.\n\nJudge: And then you call him back and say what?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him that I would discuss it with him—\n\nJudge: And then what happened after that? Why was it that you weren’t taking it?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I couldn’t afford to get the place ready for me to move in by the first.\n\nJudge: You couldn’t afford the place, period?\n\nPlaintiff: I couldn’t afford the place, period.\n\nJudge: Because you asked your boss for more hours. So you put down a deposit of $700. Do you have a receipt that says it’s refundable?\n\nPlaintiff: It does not say non-refundable.\n\nJudge: Does it say refundable?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: So no mention of whether it’s refundable or not. Does the plaintiff get the deposit back?\n\nDefendant: I don’t think so. A deposit is a decision you made by yourself and thought about already. I mean, I don’t think you can get it back.\n\nJudge: That’s pretty harsh. Maybe true. What do you say?\n\nDefendant: I also think she wouldn’t receive the money back. I mean, it’s your responsibility if you give a deposit to ask what the refund policy is.\n\nJudge: Is it your responsibility or the person who takes the money?\n\nDefendant: I think it’s both, but somebody’s got to win here.\n\nJudge: Well, if it’s 12 hours, I think she should get her money back. What’s your position on this? Why won’t you return the money?\n\nDefendant: I offered a pro-rated amount until I could get it rented, and I was going to refund that amount of money.\n\nJudge: Did you ever end up renting it?\n\nDefendant: Yes, someone moved in yesterday.\n\nJudge: The problem is that when you hand over a deposit, the default position is not \"it’s refundable.\" The default position is that it’s non-refundable. If you want it to be refundable, you should have that on the receipt.

{"id": "730", "dialogue": "Judge:\nVictoria, you are suing Boulevard Cleaners for $5,000 in damages to your wedding dress. According to you, you're out more than that, but that's your statutory cap. So, talk to me and tell me what happened. When did you get married?\n\nPlaintiff:\nMarried August 14th, 2016.\n\nJudge:\nHow's it going?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt's going great. Is that him?\n\nJudge:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay. So, what happened? The day of our wedding, it was hot and humid—96°—one of the hottest days of summer. I didn’t get to take the pictures that I wanted to take because I was wearing my hair down, and I didn’t want to sweat and stuff like that. So, we had a photo shoot scheduled for October when my photographer was available. After I came back from my honeymoon, I brought in my dress. I wanted to clean it before the photo shoot because it did have some stains on it from the wedding, and I just wanted it cleaned. I brought it to a dry cleaner I’d been using for about a year after we moved to Staten Island. I was really nervous because of how expensive the dress was.\n\nJudge:\nHow much was the dress?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOver $8,000. I believe it was like $8,200 for a Vera Wang wedding dress.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so it's a designer dress.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you dropped it off. They called you when it was ready, and you picked it up. You didn’t open the dress right away. When did you open it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt was like 4 days later, so I would say like September 30th.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you’re home, and you unzip the bag, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt looked the way it looks now.\n\nJudge:\nWow, it’s a beautiful dress, so it’s shredded. The color’s a little different, and it’s shrunk. It’s small on me.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, back it up. It’s shredded. What does that mean?\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight here. It didn’t look like this at my wedding. It did not look like this at the end of my reception. I have pictures.\n\nJudge:\nDid it look like this after your wedding?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, it didn’t. I have pictures from the end of my reception. So, it did not look like this at the end of the wedding.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and the color, according to you, the color is more ivory than it was before?\n\nPlaintiff:\nMuch more ivory than it was, yes. They told me they didn’t put it in a machine, but it shrunk on me. I didn’t gain like 20 lbs in 3 weeks.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go ahead and go back. Does the garment have care instructions?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat are the care instructions?\n\nPlaintiff:\nDry clean. It’s done in the machine by itself. There are no other garments whatsoever in the machine by itself.\n\nDefendant:\nWhen she brought in the dress, it had stains on it, it was very dirty on the bottom where the train dragged on the floor, and the lace trim was ripped. She just wanted the best job I could do for taking pictures from the waist up. I think I made the dress 1,000 times better than it was before, but now, look at it.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened here?\n\nDefendant:\nI told her, please bring it into my store if there’s anything I can help you with to fix it. I would’ve fixed it free of charge.\n\nJudge:\nSo, once you picked up the dress... Do you have pictures from your wedding?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so I can see the color.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes. The last picture I have is from the end of the reception, showing that my dress was still in one piece.\n\nDefendant:\nI don’t know where you went after that or what you did, but yeah, that’s a great picture.\n\nJudge:\nAnd so, what do you think happened?\n\nDefendant:\nThe label says dry clean. Sometimes white dresses have fluorescent dyes in them, and fluorescent dyes can cause a change in color, for example, if you go into a nightclub and wear a white shirt, your shirt turns color. Manufacturers sometimes don’t use good dyes, and they get affected by the dry cleaning process. I did exactly what the label said. If you had brought it to 5,000 other dry cleaners, the same thing would have happened. My customers never had a problem with me.\n\nDefendant:\nI told her when she called me on the phone, I said, \"Why don’t you call the manufacturer and see if it’s the dye that changed colors?\" I did exactly what the label said. I’m a fair guy. I don’t want anyone mad at me.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s fair about that? You blew her off and told her to go contact Vera?\n\nDefendant:\nI told her to contact the designer and then I said, \"Please bring the dress in.\" She said she was going to come in on a Friday around 12. I said no problem, I’ll be there. What would you be able to do if you saw the dress?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, she said that something was loose on it or it was tearing. I could have fixed it for her, no charge. But the color? There’s nothing that can be done.\n\nJudge:\nNothing to be done about the color?\n\nDefendant:\nNothing to be done. It’s not my fault that the color changed. She could have brought it to any cleaner and the same thing would’ve happened. It’s just a faulty dye the manufacturer uses. But I was willing to fix the damage for free. The color definitely changed, and also, I use crystal clear chemicals. I only do dry cleaning.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever contact the manufacturer?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I didn’t. I wanted to contact Vera Wang, but I pulled up a contract I signed when I picked out my dress. It said that whatever happens to the dress, they’re not responsible once I leave the building with it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey’re not responsible?\n\nDefendant:\nThey’re not responsible for whatever happens with the dress once you leave the building with it.\n\nJudge:\nWell, unless they’re responsible. They’re not responsible for something like if you tear the dress, they’re not responsible.\n\nPlaintiff:\nRight, and I mean, it’d be interesting to know if this is a problem that they’ve had with those dresses.\n\nDefendant:\nCan I just say something?\n\nJudge:\nYes.\n\nDefendant:\nYes, he did tell me to come in and he would fix it, but besides it being a different color, being shredded, it’s small, it’s shrunk. When I did, I told them, \"You must have put it in a machine because it shrunk.\" So there’s nothing that you could do in the week before.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay, what can you do regarding the shrinkage?\n\nDefendant:\nHow does it shrink? Dry cleaning is a dry side solvent. It’s impossible for anything to shrink. If you wash it, then stuff can shrink, but not in dry cleaning.\n\nJudge:\nI’m not a laundry man. I don’t do dry cleaning. I won’t ever wash a Vera Wang dress. That’s ridiculous.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI didn’t gain a lot of weight, about 10 lbs.\n\nJudge:\nI’m looking at the difference between here and here.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh, no, that’s just the fabric of the dress. When they put on wedding dresses, they wear undergarments to make everything tighter, so that could be a reason why.\n\nJudge:\nHow many of those have you put on?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHow much do you think that gives you?\n\nJudge:\nI didn’t. I’m just saying, yeah, I did, and it doesn’t give me that much.\n\nDefendant:\nNo, what I’m saying is the garment that they are making, if it does shrink, it’s nothing that I’m doing.\n\nJudge:\nI understand what you’re saying. I understand what you’re saying. But, see, I understand both sides.\n\nJudge:\nWhat I really, really need and what I would love to have from you in order to give you the relief that you are asking for is some kind of expert testimony from another dry cleaner saying they did something wrong, because this fabric is X, and this is what should happen with this. Some kind of testimony that says that they did something wrong.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, first of all, when I had called him to speak to him about my dress, he didn’t know who I was or what my dress was or any of the process that went about it. He did tell me—I said, \"You must have put it in a machine because it shrunk.\"\n\nDefendant:\nWe spot cleaned the stains first to get all the stains out. The bottom of the dress was filthy. It’s beautiful now. I took out all the stains, then we put it in the machine by itself, in special nets so nothing rips off. It does the same thing as a washer and dryer in your house except it doesn’t have water. It has perylene and soap, which is a dry clean chemical.\n\nJudge:\nI can’t do it, Victoria. I can’t look at this and based on the evidence that I’m hearing, conclude that it’s more likely than not that he messed up in the dry cleaning. I can’t because it could also be the fabric. I just can’t. Not without some expert testimony of another cleaner who looks at that and says, \"Oh, you can tell that this went wrong and this is what went wrong.\"\n\nJudge:\nI am going to order you to go ahead and bring it in. Well, I’m not going to order you, but if you want to have it fixed, then he is making himself available to do it. And how much was the dry cleaning?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$193.\n\nDefendant:\nWhy?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI have no problem giving it to her.\n\nJudge:\nI’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff and awarding the $193 for the dry cleaning. You can have the damage fixed, but that’s the extent of my ruling, based on the evidence in front of me. All right, folks, good luck, and best of luck to the two of you.\n\nDefendant:\nThank you.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nThe plaintiff is going to get the cost of the dry cleaning back, about $190. It’s a tough situation for you, Joseph. A lot of people can understand that, but really, there’s nothing else you can do?\n\nDefendant:\nNothing I can do. I’m doing exactly what the label says.\n\nJudge:\nLet me ask you this. The judge seemed to indicate she thought it shrank like 4 inches on her. That would be impossible to fix, too, wouldn’t it?\n\nDefendant:\nThat’s a lot. I could possibly stretch it out a little, but 4 inches? It all depends on the material, what time, but yeah.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re willing to try?\n\nDefendant:\nOf course. I’m willing to make all my customers happy.\n\nJudge:\nYou sound like a good guy. Thank you.\n\nDefendant:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nYou must sign a few documents now.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe bride is on her way out of the courtroom. Cover yourself up here. Listen, you know, it was a dilemma for the judge trying to help you out. She wanted to, but there wasn’t much else you could do.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI appreciate her help.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you never did call the manufacturer, right, to inquire or anything?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThere was no need to.\n\nJudge:\nSo, what do you do with the dress?\n\nPlaintiff:\nTake it home and put it in the box.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection Minimization  "}

Pitch a tent?\n\nDefendant: He went there, and there was no police report filled out.\n\nDefendant: I talked to Bob Burns. I called him. I found his phone. I talked to him in front of the cop, and I said we made an agreement: If I work for him and give him a lawnmower, things will be settled.\n\nJudge: And you can do that, I guess.\n\nDefendant: The cop said so. That’s what we did.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead and come back over here. So now, the deal was that if he worked for you for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: Four hours, your honor.\n\nJudge: Was that the deal? Work for me for four hours and replace my lawnmower?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. His dad had an old lawnmower that he gave me. I said I’d try it out. The work for the vegetables was fine, and I had the lawnmower, so everything basically was settled.\n\nJudge: Okay. But the problem was?\n\nPlaintiff: The lawnmower was knocking and wouldn’t last too long. So I drove it back to his house and left it there. I replaced the lawnmower. I got a new one.\n\nJudge: Did you speak to him about the fact that the lawnmower didn’t work?\n\nPlaintiff: I wasn’t able to, your honor. I tried, but he wouldn’t answer my calls.\n\nJudge: Did you ignore him?\n\nDefendant: I returned his calls a couple of times with no answer. I probably called him three times.\n\nJudge: He brought back the lawnmower, though, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Two weeks later.\n\nJudge: I’m going to order him to pay you $85 plus your court costs. That’s my verdict. Good luck, folks.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal "}
{"id": "623", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the case of Michael Evans Sr. versus Demetrius Callaway. Mr. Evans, you are suing Mr. Callaway for $1,000—$200 of it being money you paid him and $800 for inconveniencing you and threatening you. What's going on here?\n\nPlaintiff: So, I had contacted him in October.\n\nJudge: You contacted him in October for what?\n\nPlaintiff: About fixing my car.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: But I didn’t get the money until December to pay him to fix my car.\n\nJudge: Right, okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I told him what was wrong with it—I needed camshaft sensors, my power steering pump replaced, and my dipstick holder for the transmission. He told me how much he would charge me. He was like, “$200.” He comes over, he looks at it, I give him the money.\n\nJudge: You don’t deny that you got $200, right?\n\nDefendant: Not at all.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: He doesn’t deny it. But see, in the text messages, he was saying, “Well, you ain’t got no proof that I gave you money.”\n\nJudge: Okay. I’ll see that and get a flavor of that in a minute, but go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, wait, don’t—don’t stare. Hey, hey, hey! Look, oh no, you don’t.\n\nJudge: Who is the girl next to you? You’re his what?\n\nPlaintiff’s Witness: I used to date his mother.\n\nJudge: Okay, I want you to listen very carefully to me. When I walked into this courtroom, I don’t miss a beat. I watched you staring him down, and I saw—the 17-year-old has better wisdom than you and touched your arm to try to get you to stop. Now you just did it in front of me. Don’t do that. That doesn’t help your case. Okay?\n\nDefendant: Okay.\n\nJudge: So, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So, we set up for the 3rd of January. When I texted him to see if we were still on, he informed me that he was pricing the parts now. When I called him back, I said, “Well, I found the parts.” He was like, “Well, his parts—like the fuel pump—he found for $195.” I found it for $127. Then he said the sensors he had found for like $88—I found them even cheaper than that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So then he proceeds to tell me, “Oh, well, you’re trying to save yourself some money. You should just use my parts.”\n\nJudge: Okay, can we get to—where did you end up buying the parts?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, so what date do you buy the parts?\n\nPlaintiff: That date.\n\nJudge: Just so—you buy all the parts. Now it’s January 3rd. You have all the parts. And then do you bring them to him?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: The parts had to be ordered. So I texted him back to tell him that the parts wouldn’t be in until 2:00. He tells me that 2:00 is too late, that he wouldn’t be able to do it until Saturday.\n\nJudge: This is on January 3rd, which is a what?\n\nPlaintiff: A Thursday.\n\nJudge: A Thursday. Okay. So that doesn’t sound so unreasonable. So what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I had an interview—a job interview—that Friday. So me not being able to drive to my interview, I ended up missing it because—\n\nJudge: Take public transportation to the interview.\n\nPlaintiff: Because there’s—uh—Cleveland public transportation is terrible.\n\nJudge: People use it.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, people use it, but the bus drivers are real nasty with people, and I’ve been in alter—\n\nJudge: You really had to miss the interview? You could have made it, you just—All right, so what happens then?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him Saturday wasn’t going to work. He was like, “Well, you know, I don’t know what to tell you.” I’m like, “Well, just give me my money back.” We set up a date for Tuesday the next week.\n\nJudge: So Tuesday comes—wait, what’s the Tuesday date for?\n\nPlaintiff: For him to give me my money back.\n\nJudge: So then Tuesday comes.\n\nPlaintiff: He tells me, “Oh, you would have been better off getting the work done by me and paying for my parts because I don’t have the money to return to you.” At that point, I said, “Look, I’m not going to argue with you. I’m just going to file a small claims case against you.”\n\nJudge: So what’s your version of how things went down?\n\nDefendant: I don’t remember all these dates, but I can tell you exactly what went on. I would never turn him down from doing the work. I always was telling him we could do the work, but his times didn’t match up with mine. So he wanted his money back, and I couldn’t give him the money back. I said, “You’ll be better off getting the work done from me ‘cause I don’t have the money.” I just had Christmas and all this, so I don’t have the money. All my money went to my kids.\n\nJudge: Right, but you were taking—that was money that was for labor, for working. So that’s kind of on you that you spent the money.\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it was labor that I thought I was going to do.\n\nJudge: Right. The issue is about parts and who was going to pay for the parts. Your pricing on the 3rd was X and his was X minus what?\n\nPlaintiff: He was $27 cheaper.\n\nJudge: Okay, so he wants to save $27. Who cares? Whether it’s $27 or $127, it’s his money. So he decides he’s going to buy the parts. But what was the problem then with the schedule?\n\nJudge: After reviewing the evidence and considering both arguments, I find in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant is ordered to return the $200 that was originally taken. However, the additional $800 claim for inconvenience and alleged threats is denied, as there is insufficient evidence to substantiate these claims.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, but the threats—\n\nJudge: I understand your concerns, but based on the evidence presented, there is no concrete proof of any damages or threats beyond your statements. Unless you can provide further documentation or witness testimony, I cannot rule in your favor on that claim.\n\nDefendant: So, I only have to pay back the $200?\n\nJudge: Correct. You must return the $200 to the plaintiff within 14 days. Failure to comply may result in further legal consequences.\n\nPlaintiff: This is unfair! I was harassed for days.\n\nJudge: I have made my ruling based on the legal standards required. If you wish to pursue additional damages, you may seek further legal action.

Okay, you both asked to be referred to only by your first names. Brock, you are suing your former partner Dylan for $5,000 in credit card statements plus your lost wages and I guess punitive damages for ruining your credit. According to you, what's going on?\nPlaintiff (Brock): So we started dating in 2012, and when we were together, we both came out to our families. His mom and dad cut him off and took his car, took his computer, and so we moved to Florida to my family's place in the fall. We started taking classes, so he needed a computer. Um, we went to the Apple Store and the card was denied, so he asked me—he's like, \"\"I'll pay it off in three months. We won’t use it for anything else. Like, it’s just—I need this computer for school.\"\" I was like, \"\"All right, that's fine.\"\" You know, we’d been together, we lived together, we had pets together.\nJudge: And how much did the computer cost?\nPlaintiff (Brock): About $2,300.\nJudge: Was this an actual credit card they had you apply for at Apple?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Yeah, yeah.\nJudge: And it was only under his name, correct?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Correct.\nJudge: And how much were the monthly payments?\nPlaintiff (Brock): $75.\nJudge: And were you paying it?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Correct.\nJudge: How long were you two together after the purchase of the computer?\nPlaintiff (Brock): About two years, almost.\nJudge: And there were no problems with the payments until then?\nPlaintiff (Brock): So what happened is, he personally said, \"\"I’ll pay it off to you within three months,\"\" um, the original purchase.\nJudge: Any proof of that?\nPlaintiff (Brock): I do not. I thought the card was closed, so I didn’t know anything about it.\nJudge: You didn’t check to see if—like, were the statements—like, were you getting statements?\nPlaintiff (Brock): I wasn’t, and that’s the thing.\nJudge: And how did somebody else close your card?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Because he had access to the account.\nJudge: Because you were living together?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Correct.\nJudge: So he had the passcode and whatever else and could get on it through the internet?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Yeah, correct.\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\nPlaintiff (Brock): In September, I found out that there was a balance. I got a letter from the credit card company saying that there was $672.70 on that card that I thought was gone. After we had purchased the computer, I cut up the card because I didn’t—I make $188,000 a year, I don’t want to—I don’t want to—\nJudge: What happened? What happened?\nDefendant (Dylan): So when this card was opened, the account later came in. Like, they send you a letter in the mail saying, \"\"Here’s your further information on your account. Set up an account so you can pay the monthly bill.\"\" Um, he did that for me, and I attached my bank account information to it so I could log in and pay the $75 a month. When that was finished, I told him that it was paid in full. I never closed the account.\nJudge: When was it that you told him, \"\"I’m done paying?\"\"\nDefendant (Dylan): Probably January or February of 2014.\nJudge: Okay. And when was the card opened?\nPlaintiff (Brock): August of 2013.\nJudge: So I got the letter from the card, and I—so I looked, I called—\nPlaintiff (Brock): This is when? In September of 2015. So we had broken up in August of 2014.\nJudge: So a little bit over a year.\nPlaintiff (Brock): I thought the card was closed. I got a letter saying that there was a balance on it. So I called, found out. Um, I started going through it. There were charges for Lipine, for IKEA, a lot of—he cashed out Venmo. So directly cashed out about $2,000 at the end of it.\nJudge: Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.You're saying there were additional charges on the card?\nPlaintiff (Brock): Yes. After I called and checked the statement, I saw multiple transactions I never made. There were purchases at IKEA, Lipine, and direct cash withdrawals through Venmo.\nJudge: Dylan, did you make these charges?\nDefendant (Dylan): I did, but I didn’t think it was an issue at the time.\nJudge: How could you not think it was an issue? The card was opened for one purchase—your computer. Why were you still using it after you said you had paid it off?\nDefendant (Dylan): I thought since the account was in his name but I had access, it was okay as long as I was making payments. I always meant to pay it back.\nJudge: But you didn’t pay it back. You left Brock responsible for a balance he didn’t even know existed. And you changed the account address, correct?\nDefendant (Dylan): I did, but that was just because I had moved.\nJudge: No, you didn’t change it when you moved. You changed it after you two broke up. That means Brock had no way of knowing about the charges.\nPlaintiff (Brock): Exactly. I would have handled it differently if I had known. Instead, my credit took a hit, and I had to spend time and effort just to figure out what was going on.\nJudge: I am awarding you the $2,722 that you’re out and ordering him to pay that. And you know what? I am going to order him to pay your time away from work because I do think it was vindictive. And if I think it was vindictive and done to posture after having done something so vile as what he did—which I know he did because there is no reason for a year later for the address to be changed—so he can let them know where he’s living. There’s no reason to do that other than for you not to know that he’s taking money. Okay?\nDefendant (Dylan): I really didn’t mean for it to turn into this.\nPlaintiff (Brock): I just want it resolved. I’ve dealt with enough stress from this.\nJudge: The ruling stands. Dylan, you are ordered to pay Brock a total of $3,975. Case closed.\n(The Judge bangs the gavel, signaling the end of the case. Dylan looks frustrated but says nothing.

We are here today to hear the case of Mr. Johnson versus Mr. Reynolds regarding the sale of a 1969 Chevy Camaro. Mr. Johnson, you are the plaintiff. Please state your claim.\n\n**Plaintiff (Mr. Johnson):** Yes, Your Honor. I purchased a 1969 Chevy Camaro from Mr. Reynolds for $25,000. He assured me the car was in excellent condition and had no significant mechanical issues. However, after I took possession of the vehicle, I discovered multiple mechanical problems, including a faulty transmission and significant rust damage that had been covered up.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Reynolds, how do you respond to these allegations?\n\n**Defendant (Mr. Reynolds):** Your Honor, I sold the car in good faith. I disclosed everything I knew about its condition at the time of sale. Mr. Johnson inspected the car before purchasing it, and I even allowed him to take it for a test drive. Any issues that arose after the sale are beyond my control.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Johnson, did you have a mechanic inspect the car before purchasing it?\n\n**Plaintiff (Mr. Johnson):** No, I did not. I trusted Mr. Reynolds’ word and the visual inspection I conducted myself.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Reynolds, did you provide any written documentation regarding the condition of the car?\n\n**Defendant (Mr. Reynolds):** No, Your Honor. It was a verbal agreement, but I did state that the car was being sold “as-is.”\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Johnson, were you aware that the car was being sold “as-is”?\n\n**Plaintiff (Mr. Johnson):** He did not explicitly say “as-is” when we spoke, but there was nothing in writing about it.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Reynolds, did you intentionally conceal any issues with the car?\n\n**Defendant (Mr. Reynolds):** Absolutely not, Your Honor. The car was in good running condition when I sold it.\n\n**Judge:** Do either of you have any evidence to present?\n\n**Plaintiff (Mr. Johnson):** Yes, I have a report from a mechanic who inspected the vehicle after my purchase. It states that the transmission was in poor condition before I even bought it, and that rust damage had been concealed.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Reynolds, do you have any counter-evidence?\n\n**Defendant (Mr. Reynolds):** No, Your Honor. I did not conduct a pre-sale inspection myself, but I was driving the car without issues before selling it.\n\n**Judge:** Based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the car had pre-existing issues that were not disclosed to the buyer. While the sale was verbal, the seller had an obligation to be transparent about significant defects.\n\n**Judge:** My ruling is in favor of the plaintiff. Mr. Reynolds, you are ordered to compensate Mr. Johnson for repair costs totaling $4,500.

You are the owner and you are a principal in the business, and you are representing yourself?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing for $500 for the removal of rubbish that was his responsibility that he didn't remove. Okay, talk to me. You bought a house from him?\n\nPlaintiff: Bought a house from him. The day before the closing, we did a walk-through, and he wasn't there. I did a walk-through with the listing agent, and there was all this garbage—construction material, metal pipes, bricks, pavers, garbage, regular trash from people eating lunch, garbage bags. There was a ton of garbage there.\n\nJudge: So, you go to the closing.\n\nPlaintiff: I mentioned it to the agent.\n\nJudge: You did not go to the closing? You had your attorney there?\n\nPlaintiff: I was not at the closing, Your Honor. My attorney represented me.\n\nJudge: So, you complained to the attorney, \"Look, there's all this garbage, and I want it gone.\"\n\nPlaintiff: First, I mentioned it to the listing agent who was with me at the final walkthrough, and she said, \"We'll take care of it at closing.\"\n\nJudge: So, at closing, you bring it up, and what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I brought it up to the attorney, his attorney, and he didn't know anything about it. He left the room. I don't know if he made a phone call to him.\n\nJudge: Did your attorney call you from the closing and tell you that he wants it to be made part of the paperwork?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. I was out of the state.\n\nJudge: Well, your attorney was your representative there, and according to the paperwork in the closing, he agreed on your behalf to have you be responsible to remove the garbage.\n\nDefendant: Indeed.\n\nJudge: So, then what happens? You close?\n\nPlaintiff: At closing, he handwrites just a rider to the closing documents saying that it'll get taken care of. I waited. I called the law office a few days after I moved in or the next week, and they said the defendant was out of the country. I had to wait until he got back. So, I waited till the date that he got back, I don't remember exactly when, and I called again. I called his attorney's office many times. Finally, they said he was going to stop by sometime to take a look.\n\nOne day, he rang my Ring doorbell. I was out of town, and I saw him on my phone. He asked me to call him, so I did. He told me, \"Look, I'm not taking care of this stuff. You must have persuaded my attorney somehow to write this contract up, but I never agreed to it, and I'm not taking care of it.\" He said, \"If you want, I'll take the white fence that was in the garage. I know about that, I'll take it to the curb for you.\" I knew the sanitation department doesn’t take building materials, so I would get fined if that was out there. I told him no, don’t do anything. He said, \"Well, if you don’t like it, sue me.\" So, that’s what I did.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you tell me about that visit to his house?\n\nDefendant: In fact, Your Honor, I have visited his location a few times. There was no answer. And apparently, he forgets that in the agreement signed by my lawyer, it needed the final water bill, reestablishing a door that was closed by me to obtain a certificate of occupancy, as well as some other garbage. The word \"garbage\" was never defined. The bricks he’s mentioning were left there as a nice way to have a seat or whatever.\n\nJudge: What is this here? I guess at some point, this used to be a fire pit?\n\nPlaintiff: I wasn’t concerned with that.\n\nJudge: What is this pile?\n\nDefendant: These are bricks that were on the side of the fence, which matched other parts of the bricks. We left them there in case he had any broken ones so he could use them.\n\nJudge: Do these bricks match pavers that you have somewhere in the house?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they don’t. I don’t know what they’re there for.\n\nJudge: Now we’re looking at garbage. This is the main part. Is this the fence you were talking about?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, that’s the fence I had to remove. Anything white, vinyl, that’s what I had to remove from the garage.\n\nJudge: Where’s the garbage you talked about?\n\nPlaintiff: You see that bag on the left? If you keep scrolling through the pictures, you'll see more garbage—pieces of wood, metal pipes, trash.\n\nJudge: Can I see the contract that got amended? From both parties, please.\n\n(Reviews contract)\n\nJudge: The rider states, \"Seller agrees to obtain and pay the final water meter, clear all rubbish from rear yard, and install a door to basement as was existing at the time of the original listing with the broker.\" I presume the water meter bill and the door have been fixed?\n\nPlaintiff: The door was never fixed, but I don’t care about that anymore.\n\nJudge: So, you did not remove the rubbish in the rear?\n\nDefendant: I did not remove the rubbish in the rear.\n\nJudge: You called a company to take it away and paid $500?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I have an invoice as proof.\n\nJudge: Let me see it.\n\n(Reviews invoice)\n\nJudge: Vinyl, metal, masonry, miscellaneous garbage—$500.

{"id": "370", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff Candice Beteta. She says she hired the defendant to do some electrical work in her house, and when he went to the attic, he damaged her air conditioning ducts.\n\n**Plaintiff:** That's right. He stepped on them, squishing them so air couldn't get through, and he refuses to reimburse me for the $700 it cost to get them fixed.\n\n**Judge:** That's exactly why she's suing him.\n\n**Judge:** This is the defendant Jeff Kyle. He says he and the plaintiff dated about 30 years ago, and she hired him for some electrical work. The woman had many contractors in and out of the attic. She didn’t get any permits or hire licensed people, and when he found out about it, she got angry and accused him of damaging her air ducts. He categorically denies damaging them and owes this woman nothing. He’s accused of not watching where he steps.\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff hired the defendant to do electrical work, and the guy damaged the air conditioning system. Now, the defendant says they used to date, and she's making this up because she got angry. It's the case of condition to sue.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Candice Beteta, you are suing Jeff Kyle, doing business as Kyle Electric, for $700—the cost to repair some air ducts that you say he damaged. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** In July of 2017, I purchased a condo that my 88-year-old aunt would be moving into. During the course of escrow, there was a home inspection conducted. During the inspection, the air ducts located in the attic of the condo had some minor repairs that were necessary. According to the inspection report, it says \"tears,\" and those were repaired.\n\n**Judge:** Correct. By the homeowners’ association?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. Once escrow closed, I was looking into renovating the condo, bringing it up to date. It was built in 1965, had been sitting for 15 years, and was in need of repair and renovation. It's a senior community, so neighbors were happy to see somebody was finally going to purchase it, renovate it, and they’d have a new neighbor. Electrical repairs and renovations were necessary.\n\nHaving known Jeff Kyle for a number of years—over 23 years—\n\n**Judge:** How’d you know him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I knew him from work where I worked.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, he conducted work on the condo for me. Kyle Electric stated that all the work was completed, and we did a room addition—a sunroom addition—to the rear of the location. We wanted to put an air conditioning unit in that location. To do that, we had an air conditioning man come out. He took a look at the ducts to make sure that they were functioning properly. He gave us an estimate, and it was good to go. He ordered the air conditioning unit and came back two weeks later to install it.\n\nThe air conditioning man came and said there was a problem with the ducts.\n\n**Judge:** That was two weeks after he had looked at the ducts, correct? So, what’s the date he looks at the ducts?\n\n**Plaintiff:** December 1st.\n\n**Judge:** And then the date he goes to install the new AC, or that section of the AC, is what date?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s December 19th.\n\n**Judge:** And who was in the attic between December 1st and December 19th?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The only people working in the attic at the time were Jeff Kyle’s two employees. They were working there unsupervised and finishing electrical work.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have pictures of how it was crushed?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Now they’re literally pulled away. Correct? If you look at—how is it sliced? What business would the electrical guy have to slice in the middle of the duct? Or is that just—\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, if you look at that photo, you’ll see the yellow electrical wire going around where that duct originally was connected.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, I see it. That’s yellow wire going around the duct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** That’s electrical wire?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Why is it hanging like that in the wind?\n\n**Defendant:** I’m going to have to ask you that question. That’s going over where the air unit is. There’s no reason—\n\n**Judge:** Why is it just hanging? Why is it like that instead of neatly against a surface or something?\n\n**Defendant:** She had had somebody else come in after I did.\n\n**Judge:** Did you guys do that? Yes or no?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Are you saying another electrician did that?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes. She did have some—\n\n**Judge:** But these are when the pictures were taken, when they found out there was damage. Why did she hire another electrician according to you?\n\n**Defendant:** Because we had a falling out.\n\n**Judge:** What was the falling out about?\n\n**Defendant:** About getting paid, and then finding out that—\n\n**Judge:** Wait, hold on. Why would she not pay you? What did she say?\n\n**Defendant:** It’s not that she wasn’t going to pay me. She just kept dragging it on and dragging it on.\n\n**Judge:** Did you two date?\n\n**Defendant:** We went out once or twice.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so did you stay friends after that?\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah.\n\n**Judge:** She doesn’t pay you, and she tells you the reason she’s not paying you is what?\n\n**Defendant:** Just because she wants to make sure everything works. And it’s like, okay, that’s fine. And then it got to be like 30 days.\n\n**Judge:** When was the last day you worked there?\n\n**Defendant:** I believe it was about December 5th.\n\n**Judge:** Did any employee of any kind go up into that attic between December 1st and December whatever?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Only two, and they were Kyle Electric employees.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Now we know the HVAC guy pops his head in and sees this?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And then he tells you, “We have a problem”?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** You want them to pay what you paid for the new air ducts, which was $700?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** I’m convinced it happened during the time that we’re saying it happened.

{"id": "111", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, George Cali and Elizabeth Samantha Conan, you’re representing her—she is your daughter?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she is.\n\nJudge: And you’re representing both of you?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: You are suing Sharky’s Pool Service, represented here by Matthew, you've asked us not to use your last name, for $4,500 because according to you they damaged your pool liner. You are counter-claiming against them $328.71 in charges that they have apparently stopped on their credit card.\n\nPlaintiff: Let me hear from you first, Mr. Callie. What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, excuse me, we’ve had Sharky’s for 2 years. They closed the pool in September of last year.\n\nJudge: Hold on one second. What's involved in closing a pool?\n\nPlaintiff: Blowing out the lines underground, removing the equipment, and then putting the cover on. Put the chemicals in, remove the ladder, diving board, etc., get paid, and leave.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you clean the pool?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, part of closing the pool is to vacuum the pool at the same time. They’ve done it.\n\nJudge: Part of closing the pool to vacuum the pool?\n\nDefendant: No, you're wrong.\n\nJudge: And of course, that becomes very relevant because as it turns out when you open your pool, how many months later?\n\nPlaintiff: Six months later.\n\nJudge: It turns out that somebody left a frisbee in the pool.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay, whose frisbee is that?\n\nPlaintiff: I have the frisbee here.\n\nJudge: Who’s is it?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s not really a frisbee.\n\nJudge: Yes, it's one of my kids’—one of my grandchildren.\n\nPlaintiff: One of your grandchildren?\n\nPlaintiff: So it's a rusty—some kind of like—not really a frisbee but sort of a toy. Oh, it’s actually—it has a wire in it, it’s otherwise pure nylon, it's just that it has this one wire in it.\n\nPlaintiff: So one of the kids left a toy in the pool, and I guess nobody saw that. It's just that when the pool is closed, they usually vacuum the pool, make sure there’s no foreign objects.\n\nJudge: According to you, vacuuming the pool is not part of the...\n\nDefendant: I’ve never vacuumed anyone’s pool ever in 20 years before closing it. It’s not part of the deal unless they specifically ask. They’d have to pay extra for it.\n\nJudge: And the pool cover, is it solid or not solid?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s a mesh, so sunlight gets through.\n\nJudge: Right, that means that because algae will grow, then you had to do chlorine treatments throughout the year, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and when you put chlorine in this pool, what form do you put it in?\n\nPlaintiff: Liquid.\n\nJudge: One gallon in each corner?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, always liquid.\n\nJudge: Yes, to avoid staining.\n\nPlaintiff: All right. So, you first realize something is wrong when the pool gets uncovered. Your daughter notices what?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, she notices this stain on the bottom of the pool. There were a couple of...\n\nJudge: Why isn’t your daughter here?\n\nPlaintiff: She works at the New York Botanical Gardens, and she couldn’t be here today.\n\nPlaintiff: And we noticed that the frisbee was at the bottom. I removed the frisbee, and that’s what the liner looked like.\n\nPlaintiff: And the same talking, it was all too—I'm sorry, hold on...\n\nJudge: Oh no, that’s the drain.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, is this the discoloration we’re talking about, or is that just a reflection?\n\nPlaintiff: The whole deep part is white right by where the main drain is. Like there.\n\nJudge: Okay, if they’re pouring the chlorine in the four corners, because that’s clearly the easiest and path of least resistance, which, so I believe that’s how they’re doing it, then what’s the theory that it settles to the bottom to the deep end of the pool and that’s why it’s discolored? The rest of the pool is fine.\n\nPlaintiff: How old is the liner?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s five years old.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipt from the original purchase of the liner?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh. I have the company who installed the liner; he gave me an estimate, is really what it is.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, that’s a new liner. My question is, I want to know about this liner, so do you have any proof of how long you’ve had this liner?\n\nPlaintiff: I do not have that with me now.\n\nJudge: Okay, well, that would be a good time to have it, since this is a trial, but all right. So, Mr. Sharky?\n\nDefendant: Yes?\n\nJudge: Matthew, yes. You’re being sued for $4,500.\n\nDefendant: That’s what you have in your hand, right, the estimate for a new liner?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see that?\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: You’re being sued for $4,500 because the theory goes, if not you, then who? Why is his pool liner discoloring?\n\nDefendant: Well, now that you saw that, can I see that also, or no? Is that allowed?\n\nJudge: Of course.\n\nDefendant: Now that you see that, I have even better evidence for myself now. If it’s only in the spot he’s saying, which is around the bottom of the main drain, not the rest of the pool, I think over time, by not using a chlorine feeder, and possibly this object that I just saw today, when chlorine re-discolors the bottom of the pool...\n\nJudge: Nothing to do with this tiny little frisbee. That’s silly.\n\nDefendant: You know, but iron, just bring up one more point. The chlorine can react with many different products, especially leaves or metal, depending on what’s in the pool. What kind of water is there? Phosphates? There are many different things that can attribute to this.\n\nPlaintiff: What I did...\n\nDefendant: But it can only happen based on the chlorine, right? No sunlight, rain, snow—all the things you just listed just mean algae grows more, so you have to put more chlorine to keep it shocked, properly.\n\nPlaintiff: I usually go once a month in the winter. I only went twice this year. I have receipts to prove it. I only put in eight gallons.\n\nJudge: Can I just make a statement?\n\nPlaintiff: We paid for four treatments for the winter. That’s the normal treatment—the four treatment for the winter.\n\nDefendant: Hey, does he really pay for four during the winter, and you only did two?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t know where you got that from.\n\nDefendant: Where did you get that from?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s been always four. The year before, it’s been always four.\n\nDefendant: No, we just came for the year before. There was no protocol.\n\nJudge: Right now, your counterclaim is because when you opened the pool and you cleaned the pool, and you got paid for it with a credit card, that ended up getting reversed after I got the court papers.\n\nDefendant: Yes, I received that afterwards. I didn’t even realize.\n\nJudge: Okay, and...\n\nDefendant: Who reversed that?\n\nPlaintiff: You called the credit card company?\n\nPlaintiff: My daughter did.\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: He left the frisbee in there, which ate into the liner. I felt that he had some liability for that. Nobody sees the darn frisbee in the pool.\n\nJudge: Absolutely. I am astounded from both sides.\n\nJudge: With you know, in the Northeast, in order to make any money, you’ve got to hustle. And we don’t look at the pool. We see a big rust of something, we’ll get it out. We’re running around closing pools, 15 a day per truck. We’re not, you know, \"Wow, let me get that frisbee.\" We didn’t even see it. And it wasn’t intentional.\n\nJudge: I would imagine that if you had seen it, you wouldn’t have worked, especially if there’s metal in it.\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: I take it you’re no longer cleaning the pool. You have a new pool service?\n\nPlaintiff: Right, yeah.\n\nJudge: I was going to say, why didn’t you get—why didn’t you get a letter from that? But that explains that.\n\nJudge: All right, let me tell you, this case is a little bit disturbing to me in many regards because I don’t know what else could possibly stain the bottom other than chlorine, but there are so many proof problems. Because it’s not everyone knows he’s putting chlorine in there. The question is, did he put too much or in a form he shouldn’t have, because he should have known it would eat the liner or something like that.\n\nJudge: The best proof of that would be evidence by another pool company that says this wouldn’t have happened if that would have happened. Aside from that, you have additional proof problems, which is this: You don’t have the liner, you don’t have the receipt from the old liner. I don’t know what quality that liner is. How long that liner should have been expected to hold up under normal circumstances, and barring some evidence by another pool company that this can only happen through negligence of them, which I don’t think you have, I’m just not comfortable ordering them to pay you $4,500.\n\nJudge: And on the frisbee thing, you know, as aghast as I am that neither side saw it, the question becomes, were they paid to see it and clean it and remove kids’ toys that your kids left in there? And unless you paid for a cleaning just beforehand, which I don’t see on that bill, I don’t think it’s their job to take that out.\n\nJudge: Which means then that the reversing of the charges on that last opening and cleaning were inappropriately reversed.\n\nJudge: I am awarding on the counterclaim the $328.71, and on the plaintiff’s claim, zero.

{"id": "350", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Michelle. She says she purchased a car from the defendant’s dealership. She sold her a piece of junk. She said she’d take it back and then sent her a check, which bounced. This lady’s as sneaky as they come. She’s been playing games with her for months, and there’s no way she’s going to be taken advantage of by the likes of her. She’s suing for $3,000 for all she’s owed.\n\nThis is Ann Lillian Shaw. She says she sold a car to the plaintiff, who came back three days later, saying it wouldn’t pass the state inspection. She got that information from a private inspection center, and they’re just looking to make money regardless. For good customer service, she told her she would take the car back, sent her a check which she cashed, and now she’s coming after her for an additional $3,000. Nice try. She’s accused of selling a clunker.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff bought a car from the defendant, and it was a piece of junk. But the defendant says the plaintiff got swindled by a private inspection center and that the car wouldn’t pass inspection. Baloney!\n\nIt’s the case of Junker? He hardly knew her!\n\nThank you, Douglas.\n\nOkay, Michelle, you’ve asked us not to use your last name. You are suing SNA Auto Sales LLC, represented here by Lillian Shaw. You have power of attorney from the owner, correct?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: What’s your role there?\n\nDefendant: I’m the manager.\n\nJudge: Okay. You’re suing them for $3,000 because, according to you, they are unlawfully withholding a deposit from you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, talk to me, Michelle. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, that’s my first time buying a car. I don’t know anything about a car, and she sold me the car. She helped me do everything. So it’s a Honda Pilot. And I call Honda. I said I want to give the car a check—where to go?\n\nJudge: This is after you buy the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Not before you buy the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Not before. Okay. But because she told me everything is fine and stuff like that—\n\nJudge: Do you have the paperwork from the sale?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Let me see.\n\nPlaintiff: (Hands over paperwork)\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: So I called Honda, and when I went there and then they did an inspection on the car, they said the car had so much problem. The car had trans flush, coolant flush, front trucks, ball joint, a bunch of stuff, timing—That’s my first time buying a car. I don’t know those things, and they make me scared. I could have an accident, and I could put other people in danger by driving a car like that.\n\nSo I go back there, and I explain to her. She said, “Well, those places always tell you the car has a million issues because they want you to come back and fix it.”\n\nJudge: Was there a warranty? Did you sell her a warranty with this car?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor. There was a six-month warranty, plus we gave her a free five-year maintenance contract.\n\nJudge: So why didn’t you just bring the car back to them and say, “You’ve got to fix this, this, and this” because you had a warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: But she didn’t want to do it at all. I said, “Well, let’s go and do it.” And stuff like that. She said she didn’t even have to do it. The reason why is that she knew there was nothing wrong with the car.\n\nJudge: Okay, tell me about when she brings the car back to you. When does she bring it back?\n\nDefendant: Three days later.\n\nJudge: Okay. What does she say?\n\nDefendant: She says that there’s all this wrong with the car. She showed us an inspection report from another dealer, just like us. We can do the same thing. It’s not the inspection report from motor vehicles. We are obligated to fix anything that motor vehicle says. But in spite of that, we told her that we would fix whatever needed to be fixed once she had the inspection done at motor vehicle, which she still had time to do while waiting for her plates.\n\nJudge: Okay, so now you bring the car back to them, and you, according to you, say to them, “I’d like you to fix it.” And they say no?\n\nPlaintiff: Because she said she’s not going to fix it because she knows that there’s nothing wrong and the car already passed inspection in New Jersey state.\n\nJudge: Can you stand up if you’re going to talk? Who’s this person?\n\nDefendant: Oh, uh, Lea. She’s the owner of the dealership.\n\nJudge: Come on up. Why isn’t she standing here?\n\nDefendant: Because, um, she speaks—She’s more comfortable in Spanish. That’s her first language.\n\nJudge: Okay, but she either doesn’t speak, or she stands up and speaks. She can whisper in your ear, but she can’t shout from her seat.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Had that car passed inspection beforehand?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. So she comes in, and she says, “I don’t want the car” at some point?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: You say, “I’m not going to fix that because that’s not really wrong because we looked at the car before we gave it to you, so that stuff isn’t wrong”?\n\nDefendant: No, that’s not what we said. What we said was, “These things we don’t believe to be wrong. When you take it to motor vehicle for an authorized motor vehicle inspection, if it fails, that kicks in your warranty. It’s anything that fails motor vehicle inspection.” She took it to a mechanic who says, “Hey, these things are wrong.”\n\nJudge: How do you justify not at least having your mechanic look at it and see if any of them are wrong?\n\nDefendant: We had looked at the car originally. We don’t put a car out for sale if there’s anything like that wrong with it.

{"id": "951", "dialogue": "Judge:\nOkay, Azariah Campbell, you are suing Robert. You’ve asked us not to mention your last name for $5,000. According to you, you’re actually out more than that for lost wages and legal fees for malicious prosecution because, according to you, he had you arrested for something that you shouldn’t have been arrested for. So, talk to me, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nYes, Your Honor. On March 3rd, I was at the taxi stand in White Plains, and while sitting on the stand, I saw two people come to my car and ask me if I could take them to Yonkers. I drove them. Nobody discussed how much it would be. Both of them came into the car. I drove them to their address. I didn’t even know how long it took, approximately 25 or 30 minutes. I drove them to their address, and the gentleman gave me $28. I said to him, \"It’s $34 for the fare.\" And he was getting out of the car, grabbing his bags, and to take out the car. So I decided to get the rest of the remaining money.\n\nJudge:\nHow? You’re sitting in the front seat and your arm goes back there?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nWe both got out of the car, and I grabbed onto the bags and said to him, “You’re going to pay me my money.”\n\nJudge:\nYou grabbed the bags that were in his hand?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo did you successfully rip them out of his hand?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nNo, we were struggling over the bag, and he said, “Let go of my bag,” and he used a profane word.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the word?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nHe said, “Get off my bag.”\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So I did not let go, then he punched me in my stomach.\n\nJudge:\nWait, so you didn’t let go, and then he punched you in your stomach? Punched like this?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nYes, punched me in my stomach.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nI staggered back, and right on my side of my door, there was a Coppertone spray, which I had in my car. A Coppertone... what?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nSpray, suntan lotion.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, suntan lotion. That’s what you keep for protection?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nNo, I use it for my hands in the summer.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nI sprayed him with it in the eyes.\n\nJudge:\nYes. Okay, and then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nHe was advancing back to me, so I jumped in my car, closed the door, and took off.\n\nJudge:\nHow advancing back? He’s right on you, and how are you getting in your car if he’s right there?\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nNo, I grabbed the spray, then ran back to my car, closed the door, and took off.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go ahead and go back. What happened?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nI got into the cab at White Plains Galleria with my daughter, took a cab.\n\nJudge:\nHow old is your daughter?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\n18.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, come on up. So go on.\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nWe took the cab from the White Plains Galleria to my place of residence. Upon arrival, how much did you usually pay for that ride?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\n$28, $30 tops.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so if that’s what it cost, why were you handing the guy $28? Don’t you tip your cab drivers after a 25-minute ride?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nOccasionally, I do.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nSo I told him it was $34. I gave him $30, and then he told me it was $34.\n\nJudge:\nYou got out of the car?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes, I got out of the car, and he jumped out of the car like a madman, and he’s saying, “Give me my money,” over and over again. Repeatedly, over and over again. Until the point he chased me on my property.\n\nJudge:\nAccording to you, is there a struggle for the bags or no?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes, there was.\n\nJudge:\nWas the struggle for the bags close to the car?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes, he was grabbing my jacket and kept grabbing the bag off my jacket, and I told him, “Get off me, don’t touch me, you’re on my property, I’m calling the police.”\n\nJudge:\nWait, wait. You’re not on your property. Come over here. I need everybody to be very specific. I need to understand how this happened. So here you are, and he’s…?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nI got out of the car, and he comes around to me, and we’re arguing here. I told him I’m not giving him any more money, and I proceeded to go to my property.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, how far is your property?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nIt’s right at the curb.\n\nJudge:\nGo ahead.\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nI told him, “Get off my property. You’re harassing me.”\n\nJudge:\nDid you call the police?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes, I called the police, and I told them I’m having a problem. The cab driver is harassing me. I gave him $30, I paid my fare, and he’s not leaving me alone. There was snow on the side when he grabbed me, and I somehow slipped. It happened very fast. When I got back up, I felt a chemical burn on my face. He must have sprayed me 12 to 14 times in my face, eyes, ears, neck, everything. I was burning.\n\nJudge:\nYou don’t think it was Coppertone?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nNo, it was pepper spray.\n\nJudge:\nDo you know what the arresting officer says it was?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes, they said it was pepper spray.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So they arrived a couple of minutes later. What happens then?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nThey questioned me, and I went to the hospital. They continued to flush my eyes until the pain went away.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you went home?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So, you go home, and the police do their investigation, and he ends up getting arrested. The case gets continued five times. Who drops the charges?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nI dropped them. Why? Every time he went to court, his attorney wasn’t ready.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you just wait and see the thing through?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nI didn’t want to deal with it. I didn’t want to see him again.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t expect him to sue you right afterward, did you?\n\nDefendant (Robert):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Go ahead.\n\nDefendant’s Daughter:\nI’m 18 years old. I remember this night. We took the cab from White Plains Galleria to our place. The cab driver was being aggressive about $4. My dad got out of the car, and the driver jumped out of the car with his hand in his pocket. My dad yelled for me to get out, and then he started cursing at him. The driver was yelling, “Give me my money.” We kept telling him to leave us alone.\n\nJudge:\nDid the driver grab your father?\n\nDefendant’s Daughter:\nYes, he grabbed his jacket.\n\nJudge:\nSo, where does the spraying happen?\n\nDefendant’s Daughter:\nIt happened about 2 or 3 feet away from our house.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So the police came, and he got arrested. You end up paying a lawyer.\n\nDefendant’s Daughter:\nYes, we paid $1,500 for the lawyer and $3,800 for lost time and court appearances.\n\nJudge:\nAccording to you, the case never went to trial because the attorney wasn’t ready, right?\n\nDefendant’s Daughter:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff (Azariah Campbell):\nYour Honor, why would we have to be living in a world where you could get mad at someone, turn around, grab something to spray them with, run after them, and spray them, and that you wouldn’t be arrested? That sounds like anger instead of self-defense. Even according to your own story, when you told me what happened, he was right there when you sprayed him, which means you had to grab something and come after him several steps in order to spray him. Why wouldn’t you be arrested for it?\n\nJudge:\nIt’s not reasonable to reach in, grab something, and walk to spray a guy in the face. I find it is not reasonable. It wasn’t self-defense. I find in favor of the defendant in this case. You do not have to pay him anything.\n\nJudge:\nThat is my verdict.

Learning a new skill, something I can contribute by helping other people who don't know the skill, would be rewarding for me.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nSo, you started taking lessons with her?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nAnd how long were you doing that?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nWell, the first two Sundays were in my apartment. We started at the end of May, and the relationship quickly deteriorated. The last contact I had with her was, I think, in August or September.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nOkay, let's get to that middle part, though. So, she's in your apartment giving you sewing lessons. You're paying how much an hour or how much per session?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nI can't really say because she charged me **$145** for the sewing machine.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nOkay, how much was she charging you per lesson?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \n**$15 an hour.**\n\n**[Judge]**  \nSo, you're learning, you're liking it, you're enjoying it. And at some point, the two of you discuss no longer doing it at people's homes but instead from a location. Correct?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nWe had a discussion during the time we were having classes. I said, \"Oh, I wish I could have my own shop; then I could have people coming and going like I want.\" And she said, \"Well, why don't you get it?\" And I said, \"Well, I can't afford it.\" And she said, \"Well, I could help you. I'd be interested in helping you.\" And that's kind of how everything escalated.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nSo, you tell her that you're interested in helping her. And what is it you do?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nWell, she comes to me for the security deposit. She said she found a place, she had to get it really fast, and she gave me instructions on what to do—to get the money, get it to the landlord, get the lease there, don't ask questions, don't answer questions, give her the cash.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nI'm sorry—don't ask questions of whom?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nOf the landlord.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nOkay. Were you signing the lease, or was she?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nShe was signing the lease.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nSo, you got the money to the landlord?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nHow much money was it?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \n**$1,400.**\n\n**[Judge]**  \nAll right. And what was your understanding of your role in all of this? What were you thinking that **$1,400** was?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nThat was my advance payment on the classes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nOkay. So, you expected to get that money back in actual class time?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nAnd now, according to you, what is that money?\n\n**[Defendant]**  \nThat money was shared rent on a workspace that we could have together so I could teach her more, and we could have other people come for classes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nAnd in return, were you supposed to give her classes?\n\n**[Defendant]**  \nBecause of her gift that I was grateful for, I wanted to make sure she had formal class time in the amount that she would pay for rent in return for her gift that she gave me.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nI thought you said that she was getting access and stuff like that?\n\n**[Defendant]**  \nRight, she was sharing rent with me, and I was grateful.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nHow is that a gift?\n\n**[Defendant]**  \nWell, I looked at it—I was grateful for it. I was grateful for her wanting to come in.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nSo, she gives you something, and you give her something in return?\n\n**[Defendant]**  \nYes.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nYeah, we call that a **contract.**\n\n---\n\n**[Judge's Ruling]**  \n\"This is a contract case. You paid in advance for something, and now you want to get out of it? I'm not going to let you. You agreed to give lessons, and I’m not going to call this a gift that you don’t have to do anything for. These are lessons that are paid for, and they are going to be given. What we are going to do is try to work out a schedule before you two leave this building.\" \n\n**Verdict:** The contract must be enforced.

{"id": "38", "dialogue": "Judge: Alysa, you are suing Carl Kik for $5,000 in medical bills, surgery, and future medical expenses for your dog because, according to you, he viciously attacked him. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Okay, so on May 11th, 2014, I had some friends over. We were all in my backyard, which was fenced in. My small dog, Sasha, was outside with us, and she saw someone going by with another dog. She ran and snuck through a little hole in the fence.\n\nJudge: How was the hole there?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): It didn’t really look like a dog would actually fit through there. We were renting the house.\n\nJudge: How many dogs did you have there?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): My friend had her dog there as well, a Beagle.\n\nJudge: How many dogs would normally live there?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Just my dog, one, Sasha.\n\nJudge: Had Sasha ever gotten out before?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): No.\n\nJudge: So Sasha gets out, out into the open, to the street?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Right, to where they were.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you're walking your— and Sasha's what kind of dog?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Pomeranian.\n\nJudge: How big is Sasha? Show me with your hands.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Okay.\n\nJudge: What kind of dog do you have?\n\nDefendant (Carl): A Border Collie mix.\n\nJudge: How big is your dog? Show me with your hands.\n\nDefendant (Carl): Probably about 55 lbs.\n\nJudge: And had you walked your dog in that area before?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yes, we don’t live too far apart, or we didn’t.\n\nJudge: Was your dog on a leash?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yes.\n\nJudge: Right. So go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): I got up to get Sasha, but she had run, and then all of a sudden I hear a yelp, and I ran faster to get her. I picked her up on the little grass outside, which is technically my lawn, but outside of the fence, and I just picked her up, and her eye started filling up. He— you didn’t see him and his dog on...?\n\nJudge: Wait. I haven’t asked my question yet. You didn’t see him and his dog on your lawn, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): No.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): So you see him when Sasha’s on your lawn. You see him doing what?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): He was walking away, and then he swung his cane at the fence where the other dog was barking—the Beagle, my friend's dog. She was running along the fence barking, and I saw him swinging the cane. And he swung his cane up against the fence, but I was like pretty hysterical and just kind of— my dog's eye was filling up with blood, so...\n\nJudge: So what’d you do?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Luckily, I had friends over. They drove me to the emergency vet because I was shaking, and the dog went into shock. She looked like she was basically having a seizure. We went to the emergency vet, and she had gotten a proptosed globe, which means that her eye fell out of the socket, and they had to surgically repair that.\n\nJudge: Do you have a picture of the dog?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Yeah, I have before, before and after.\n\nJudge: How did you find who the defendant was, since he was walking away? I mean, didn’t you— nobody ran after him when he was walking away and said, “Hey, what happened here?”\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Nobody. I was concerned with my animal.\n\nJudge: No, I know, but you had a bunch of other people there. One of them could have run over.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Right, but just...\n\nJudge: Okay. So this is the puppy. This is Sasha before.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Right.\n\nJudge: Poor Sasha.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): And this is Sasha now. This is how the— that’s the best they could do.\n\nJudge: Yeah. So you have to think about this every time you look at her, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Okay.\n\nJudge: So how did you find him?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): I just asked around the neighborhood, and anybody know an older gentleman that walks around with a cane banging fences, and everybody knew exactly who you meant?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yeah, actually.\n\nJudge: All right, so what did you do?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Well, I didn’t really—I didn’t see it, so I didn’t completely know what happened. All I know is I saw him walking away swinging the cane, and I saw my dog with an eye filling up with blood. So I just went to his house to kind of try to figure out what happened, you know? Because if it was the dog that hurt Sasha or something and it was an accident, then that’s one thing. You know, but if it’s actually done by a human being that deliberately swung a cane at my animal, then I want to know about it. So I went to his house. The daughter—his daughter answered the door, and I said, you know, there was an event. My dog may lose her eye. I just want to know what happened, and she said, “Yes, my father came home, and he told me the story and everything, and he said that your dog was attacking and he hit her with the cane as protection,” and she said, “He carries the cane around to protect himself against the animals in the neighborhood.”\n\nJudge: Are there a lot of loose animals in the neighborhood?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): There was one dog, a larger dog, that the owners would leave in the front yard, but it didn’t really... It was... When you say the front yard, you mean that the dog was roaming free?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Sometimes.\n\nJudge: So did you ever talk to him, or no?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): No, I never did.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): If I were to have hurt someone else’s kid or animal, I would have offered to pay or at least apologized.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nDefendant (Carl): I’m taking my dog for a walk. Sasha jumped up in the air, bounced off the fence, and wiggled through the little opening in the fence, and then right away, like a speeding bullet, came out and she didn’t do what most dogs do. In fact, I used this defense against their Beagle very successfully. What I do...\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Wait, what are you saying?\n\nDefendant (Carl): They had the other dog—he got out through the back gate.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Oh, oh, because two—wait a second, wait a second, two dogs got out?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay. So go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Carl): So you... This defense being what? I’m sorry.\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): When you say I used this defense on the Beagle successfully, you tapped on the ground, on the ground, and put it right against...\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yep. Okay.\n\nDefendant (Carl): I think you got a little too close to this one because I didn’t have a choice. This is what ended up happening is I was bringing my cane down in order to try and get some distance, but the little Pomeranian just kept attacking at my dog’s throat.\n\nJudge: Okay, when you say attacking at your dog’s throat, did the Pomeranian actually make contact with your dog, or didn’t it get to?\n\nDefendant (Carl): No. What ended up happening is when I first— when the dog first came out...\n\nJudge: So basically the dog is rushing towards you and your dog?\n\nDefendant (Carl): I yanked my dog back.\n\nJudge: You yanked your dog back?\n\nDefendant (Carl): My dog flew by, landed on the ground, jumped right back at my dog’s throat, and that’s when— you say jumped at your dog’s throat. How?\n\nDefendant (Carl): The dog didn’t make contact with your dog’s throat, so I’m trying to figure out where is the dog when your cane flies. Where’s the Pomeranian when your cane flies?\n\nDefendant (Carl): About that far away from my dog’s neck. In the air.\n\nJudge: So you literally swatted it off with the cane?\n\nDefendant (Carl): I was trying to... come back down to try and get it to stop.\n\nJudge: Yes. Wow, what a disaster, huh?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Yep.\n\nJudge: So why didn’t you ever go apologize and explain all this? You know, she came to your house, she talked to your daughter, she was distraught. Why wouldn’t you just make contact? You know, and do kind of the human thing and say, “I’m sorry, there’s so many loose animals here. It was self-defense, whatever.” Why wouldn’t you just talk to her?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Because it’s not my responsibility to do that. My responsibility is to make sure my dog doesn’t attack other...\n\nJudge: Why don’t you let me handle the legal parts of this? I’ll handle the legal parts. I’m talking about the human part. I’m talking about the moral part. I still don’t... you don’t understand what I’m saying. My first responsibility is to take care of my dog.\n\nJudge: When you ended up leaving a puppy, a dog, looking like this for the rest of its life, that she has to look at it, all that... Don’t you think it would be a humane thing to do to go and speak with her and tell her it couldn’t be helped, this is what happened, so that she doesn’t have to hate the world?\n\nDefendant (Carl): I don’t know.\n\nJudge: I mean, it doesn’t matter to you that what she suffered. She didn’t do anything wrong other than that there’s a hole and the dog got out. That’s not an intentional act. So I understand your conduct when it happened. I don’t understand you or your conduct after it happened. I don’t know why, even while I’m standing here, when I’m suggesting to you that maybe you should feel a little bad that this happened, that you don’t turn around and tell her, “I’m sorry.” Like, aren’t you sorry a little?\n\nDefendant (Carl): Of course.\n\nJudge: Tell her that.\n\nDefendant (Carl): I really am.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to the People's Court. Har 11 here. You know, Pomeranian dogs, little tiny dogs, are they aggressive by nature?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Not really. Just a little bit yappy, but usually they’re really just really cute.\n\nJudge: Are you suggesting small dogs are not aggressive?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): Um, I think it depends on their owner.\n\nJudge: Small dogs like Pomeranians aggressive by nature?\n\nPlaintiff (Alysa): I think it’s definitely the owner. Napoleon complex, maybe, perhaps?\n\nJudge: There you go.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom. He’s walking around with a weapon. Here’s the thing, and here’s the thing that’s, you know, the issue here. You say, “Well, he shouldn’t be walking around with a weapon because he may use it in self-defense.” And that’s not the issue. The issue is, was it self-defense?\n\nJudge: Was it self-defense? Did you hit the dog in self-defense? You say yes. And now we go to his claim, the $1,500 for pain and suffering.

Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says the defendant sold hair extensions for her, rang up a sale improperly, and cost her thousands.

Okay, Tequila Fletcher and Roots to Ends Hair Studio, you are suing your former employee, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: For $3,227 in fraudulent transactions where she sold extensions to people, and all those charges were reversed, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Because it was a stolen card, correct.\n\nJudge: Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it starts out that November 2011 was the very first credit card transaction, which happened in the amount of $336.\n\nJudge: Now, she's your employee?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: You own a salon?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, and you have these products. What are the products?\n\nPlaintiff: They're hair extensions.\n\nJudge: All right, so go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: From my understanding, from what she told me, she was purchasing some hair for a coworker from her second job, which is at Verizon.\n\nJudge: With whose credit card?\n\nDefendant: I'm assuming that it was the person who was purchasing the hair.\n\nJudge: Whose credit card was it?\n\nDefendant: It was her card.\n\nJudge: Whose card?\n\nDefendant: My ex-coworker, because I no longer work there.\n\nJudge: From some other place?\n\nDefendant: From my second job.\n\nJudge: And why was it fraud then?\n\nDefendant: It turned out that it wasn’t her card. I asked her about it.\n\nJudge: Didn’t you see the name on the card? Did you have the card with you?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I had the card.\n\nJudge: You didn’t just punch in a number she gave you?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So you had physically a card with you, and you swiped it?\n\nDefendant: No, the back was scratched, magnetic strip wasn’t working, so I punched it in.\n\nJudge: And then as it turns out, the card number you punched in belonged to another human, not the person—\n\nDefendant: I didn’t realize that until after merchant services contacted me.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t bother to read the card?\n\nDefendant: It turned out to be stolen.\n\nJudge: Did you match the name with the ID?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you still didn’t catch it?\n\nDefendant: She was just a coworker I said hi to.\n\nJudge: So you don’t even know your friend’s real name?\n\nDefendant: She’s not my friend. She was my coworker.\n\nJudge: So she was going by a certain name, and then the name on the card matched, and as it turns out, you get informed by the credit card company that the transaction is being challenged because the real owner of the card says, \"I did not make that purchase.\"\n\nJudge: So now, December 10th—there are two fraudulent transactions according to your lawsuit, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Show me those transactions.\n\n(Defendant hands over paperwork.)\n\nJudge: And both are on the 10th?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So as it turns out, a week or two later, you find out these charges are reversed as fraudulent transactions?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Do you know whether she typed the numbers in?\n\nPlaintiff: It was manually done, no card swipe.\n\nJudge: Now we have December 12th. Two more fraudulent charges. One for $660, the other for $465. Again, numbers were typed in, not swiped?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And the cardholder was not present?\n\nDefendant: The cards they showed me matched the name of the person speaking.\n\nJudge: But the same card was used for multiple transactions by different people?\n\nDefendant: I was busy that day. I didn't check thoroughly.\n\nJudge: Then we move to December 26th. Three more fraudulent transactions. $670, $428, and $214. Who were these purchases for?\n\nDefendant: I don't remember the names.\n\nPlaintiff: One was M. Clarissa. Another was Nikki for $428. And the third—\n\nJudge: The third one was for you.\n\nDefendant: I explained that to Tequila Fletcher. I never personally used the credit card machine for my own purchase. It was a mistake.\n\nJudge: A mistake?\n\nDefendant: I paid in cash later.\n\nJudge: You expect me to ignore the fact that you yourself used the stolen credit card?\n\nDefendant: It was a mix-up.\n\nJudge: No, what I see is a pattern.

They send you either to school or to a job program.\n\nJudge: Okay, and that's what you were in the middle of?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I had.\n\nJudge: Or you were supposed to be in the middle of?\n\nPlaintiff: I was supposed to be in the middle of.\n\nJudge: You didn't show up?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did show up.\n\nJudge: So then you had another childcare provider who couldn’t provide the proper timing for you, so you had to find someone else that was responsible?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, and then you found her?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and for X number of days, it was working?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant: And then, the X number of days are?\n\nPlaintiff: 11 days.\n\nJudge: And then what happens after 11 days?\n\nPlaintiff: I was feeding them, you know, out of my pocket and taking them on trips out of my pocket, and I was explaining to her for the past two weeks I was doing that. But on the third week, I was running out of funds of my own and I couldn’t provide her kids with, you know, food every day because I did it for two weeks and I’m using, you know, my food for my kids. And I just told her that all she had to do is feed them breakfast and just bring, you know, lunch and a snack because that’s all they need at my house.\n\nDefendant: And she said every provider that she had fed her kids and I said, well, I can’t because I’m not on no food program. I’m using my own funds.\n\nJudge: I’m confused because during this time you still have benefits, and the other person’s not getting paid because you’ve stopped with the other person. So how are you paying for her before the benefits are in place? In other words, why is she going to not only take care of your kids for free but also feed your kids?\n\nDefendant: So it wasn’t for free. When I first bought the application to HRA, a red flag came up. They said they have to do a background checkup on her because she had a history of something she did in the past.\n\nJudge: You had a prior for worthless checks 40 years ago?\n\nDefendant: 40 years ago.\n\nJudge: Okay, but that’s still a red flag for them and so it took a little longer.\n\nDefendant: I got that.\n\nJudge: They have to do a background check up over it. It’s going to take from one to 45 days, and I explained this to her, and she said she was fine with that, but it didn’t because in the end, they approved her, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and they approved her after what?\n\nPlaintiff: After a couple of weeks, they approved her pretty much right away. I didn’t get that, but by then, you had already told the caseworker, ‘I no longer need her.’\n\nJudge: I’m looking at the paperwork. I don’t want her.\n\nDefendant: I no longer need her because on several occasions, my children came to me stating that, you know, she wasn’t feeding them, she was putting her hands on them.\n\nPlaintiff: Never happened.\n\nDefendant: She was no longer... Put her hands on them? Mean, my 5-year-old—she’s now five—she came to me, she said, “Mommy, Miss Cleo keeps popping me.”\n\nJudge: What does popping mean?\n\nDefendant: She kept slapping her on the leg. I went to her on the first occasion to talk to her because I gave her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nDefendant: I went to her and I spoke to her about it. I said, \"Listen, you know, this is not acceptable. I understand you have to discipline children verbally or put them in the corner, but popping is unacceptable.” She assured me that it would never happen again, but it did. She kept putting her hands on my 5-year-old.\n\nPlaintiff: That story’s not true. Never happened. I pop— I mean, I pop, I didn’t pop her. I just tapped her on her legs one time. We were in a sneaker store, and she’s laying down on the, you know, the things you sit on with her legs wide open, so all I did is tapped her on her legs. I mean, if you want to call it a pop, it wasn’t hard enough for her to cry or, you know, complain about it. I just popped her on the leg and just said, “You gotta close your legs.” That’s not how young ladies sit. That’s why I just popped her. I just popped her that one time.

Next case: The plaintiff says the defendant’s dog attacked his cat and killed it, then put the cat in the trash. But the defendant says the dog was on his own property. It’s the case of \"dog got your cat.\" Thank you, Douglas. Lenny Rivera, you are suing Alan Esterine for $5,000—$375 for the cost of three cats and $4,000 something for emotional distress. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, um, I was actually at the Mets baseball game. I received a phone call from my wife and my brother indicating that the dog next door had eaten my cat.\n\nJudge: Okay. Is this the brother?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, my brother and my daughter, because they were both at home when this happened.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can I see the brother? Can you come up to the microphone? Did you actually see what happened?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: No, I heard the cat screaming.\n\nJudge: And where was—did you run out when you heard the cat scream?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: I ran out, but the cat, um, already was—the pit was already on her stomach.\n\nJudge: Was it in your yard, or was it in their yard?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: It happened—the cat was in our yard, and the dog put his head out and took the cat.\n\nJudge: Put his head out of what?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: The fence. It pulled the cat.\n\nJudge: Through the fence? What kind of fence is it?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: It’s like, um—my brother has pictures.\n\nJudge: Yeah, let me see it.\n\nPlaintiff: I have numerous pictures that I want to show.\n\nJudge: What kind of dog is it?\n\nPlaintiff: A pit bull.\n\nJudge: What is the fence that we’re talking about? This iron one?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, that one.\n\nJudge: When you see it, where’s the dog, and where’s the cat?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: The cat was already in his gate.\n\nJudge: When you first see it, the cat is in his gate?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: Yes.\n\nJudge: How do you know the cat didn’t just jump in?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: I don’t know that.\n\nJudge: Oh, well, that’s important, though.\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: But that dog—you can’t even go through the gate or anything because that dog wants to attack you.\n\nJudge: Are you supposed to go through the gate?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: No.\n\nJudge: So just for the record, this dog’s very vicious?\n\nPlaintiff’s Brother: This dog—my kids can’t even come outside to play because his dog is constantly in the gate, sticking his face out, attempting to bite my children. I have three children—an eight-year-old, a six-year-old, and a four-year-old. They can’t even play on my premises due to this dog.\n\nPlaintiff: This dog actually, over the summertime, bit a crossing guard and required 18 stitches.\n\nJudge: Did the crossing guard report it?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because she said they’re friends, so she didn’t want to.\n\nJudge: Have you filed a vicious dog report?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What happened? Were you there?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I was at work at the time.\n\nJudge: How about you? Were you there? Come on up. Who are you to him?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: Girlfriend.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: The cat—from what we saw, the dog was chasing the cat around the yard and caught the cat in the front of the yard.\n\nJudge: Did you actually see it happen?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: I got it on video.\n\nJudge: You got what happened on video? Why were you taking a video instead of solving the problem?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: Well, I mean, I just got it off the video, you know, for what was going on.\n\nJudge: Why are you taking video with your camera instead of running out there and calling the dog?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: This is after—this is off my surveillance camera.\n\nJudge: You should’ve just said that. So, you were videoing—it was on your surveillance camera, and you brought it into your phone?\n\nPlaintiff’s Girlfriend: Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see it. (Reviewing footage) Okay, I see. The cat is running around, and the dog is chasing it. That means the cat was already inside the yard. You have no evidence that the dog dragged the cat in.\n\n\nJudge: After reviewing all testimonies and evidence, the law does not punish animals for acting like animals. The law punishes irresponsible behavior on the part of owners. You own a cat. You can't stop cats from jumping around into other people’s yards. You have no evidence that the defendant’s dog pulled the cat into the yard.

{"id": "394", "dialogue": "**Judge:** All parties, please raise your right hand. You may be seated. Come to order.\n\n**Judge:** Litigants have been sworn. Your honor, thank you, Douglas. Miss Kolaric, you are suing Danny for $1,500. $550 of it you want returned from your salon services, $100 to have the extensions removed, a co-pay for the doctor, and $800 in pain and suffering. What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff (Jennifer Kolaric):** So it was Mother's Day, and my mom and I went to the salon. I had an appointment. He did my hair, he cut it.\n\n**Judge:** Who’s “he”?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh, I’m sorry, Danny.\n\n**Judge:** That’s fine, I just want to clarify.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I was complaining that it was thin and, you know, what’s going on? It’s thin, and it just doesn’t grow. It takes a very long time to grow. So that’s when Danny suggested hair extensions.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And I was concerned because I’ve heard other stories about them breaking your hair, and he had promised that the ones that he was putting in—where he was having one of the girls at the salon put them in—she’s a specialist, and it’s all about how they’re put in. And that they’re tape extensions and will not break your hair.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so tell me about the extensions and how they work.\n\n**Defendant (Danny):** These are tape-in extensions. How it works is you take a thin slice of hair—\n\n**Judge:** When you say “thin slice,” you mean just a small section of hair?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, we section off a little piece of hair.\n\n**Judge:** You don’t actually cut the hair or anything?\n\n**Defendant:** No, not at all.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** There are two extensions, both of which have tape on them, and we pretty much sandwich the real hair between the two extensions.\n\n**Judge:** What product do you use?\n\n**Defendant:** We get our hair from a wholesale company.\n\n**Judge:** How long have you been using that company?\n\n**Defendant:** Since we opened, so about a year.\n\n**Judge:** How close do you put it to the scalp?\n\n**Defendant:** It’s supposed to be an inch away from the scalp.\n\n**Judge:** And why is it supposed to be an inch away?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s just the proper way to install them.\n\n**Judge:** Do you know why?\n\n**Defendant:** I personally don’t do hair extensions, but it’s because you don’t want it too close to the scalp. Jennifer actually had it done twice. It wasn’t the first time she got it done, and from my knowledge, she was very happy the first time, so she got it done again.\n\n**Judge:** How many times did you get the extensions done?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I had it done the first time on May 18th.\n\n**Judge:** And then you had it done a second time?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, that’s how I was told it works. You have them put in—\n\n**Judge:** When was the second time you went in?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I believe it was June 26th.\n\n**Judge:** Six weeks later?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, around June 27th.\n\n**Judge:** And then what happens on the second date? You have them taken out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, all of them. I had ten extensions in.\n\n**Judge:** And then you have fresh ones put in?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I was told that they could only be used twice. So, the second time, they take them out and put them back in, and then I can’t use them anymore.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. When did you first notice a problem?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Two weeks after that.\n\n**Judge:** And what was the problem?\n\n**Plaintiff:** My friend and coworker Lisa noticed something.\n\n**Judge:** Lisa, go ahead.\n\n**Lisa:** We were at work, and she was showing me her extensions. She was very proud of them. But when she turned her head, I noticed a bald spot. I could see her scalp, and I had never seen that before. We’ve worked together for over ten years, and I had never seen that spot before.\n\n**Judge:** The day you noticed this was about mid-July?\n\n**Lisa:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** How big was the bald spot? Is it still there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have a picture.\n\n**Judge:** Let me see it.\n\n(Examines photos)\n\n**Judge:** The bald spot is gone now?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s still there, but less noticeable.\n\n**Judge:** You have a doctor’s note?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, it says I had traction alopecia due to the extensions rubbing against my scalp.\n\n**Judge:** Extensions don’t rub, people rub. Did you feel it happening?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, but that’s what the doctor said.\n\n**Judge:** Did you take this issue to another salon?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I had someone else remove them.\n\n**Judge:** Did they tell you anything was wrong?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She said they were close to the scalp.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have any documentation of that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Your theory, Danny, is that she left the salon happy and whatever happened later isn’t your fault?\n\n**Defendant:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** How could something like this happen?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t know what happened after she left. When she returned, all ten extensions were still in place.\n\n**Judge:** That’s a strong point—if all the hair that was attached to the extensions was intact, then something else likely caused the bald spot.\n\n**Judge:** Based on what I’m hearing, these cases are tough to prove. Typically, the way to prove them is by getting a second opinion from a professional, stating what was done wrong. The issue here is that she had no issues until two months later, and the evidence doesn’t support that the salon was negligent.\n\n**Judge:** I don’t see that you have proven that the salon did anything wrong. I am ruling in favor of the salon.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I’m disappointed, but that’s life.\n\n**Defendant:** I wasn’t sure I would win, but I am happy with the outcome.\n\n**Judge:** Case dismissed.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "appeal to emotionExaggeration"}

You've asked us not to mention the company you work for. For $950 in damages to your mirror and the driver's side of your car because according to you, he sideswiped you. Tell me what happened on the morning of Monday, August 1st.\n\nPlaintiff: Your Honor, I was driving my car to Upper West Side to help my friend Tim. He had just moved into his new apartment, and we were taking some items to the Goodwill store. So we went upstairs to Tim's apartment and we helped pack.\n\nJudge: Is this Tim?\n\nPlaintiff: This is Dan. He's my friend who was with me, who helped me and Tim.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. So he was there.\n\nPlaintiff: He was there. He came with me and he was in the car. We parked it, and we went upstairs to help Tim. So we came down with some bags to take into the car. Then we were gonna wait, double parked, while we waited for Tim to bring the rest of the stuff down.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: While we came down around 8:20, we saw the truck drive by driven by Mr. Lucas. We saw him sideswipe. Actually, I heard the sound. I didn't see it as much as I heard it. Then I looked up, and I saw his truck driving. It hit my car and took my mirror off my side view on the driver's side. I saw the side of my car had been hit.\n\nJudge: Can I see a picture of the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, absolutely.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: Upon realizing that my car had been hit, I kind of chased after the car a little bit on foot. I tried to chase after, but it just kept going. I caught most of the license plates. Then we kind of gathered and wrote down some notes on my phone. We had a license plate number and whatever we could recall. We came back to the car, and I actually found on the windshield a note from a Good Samaritan.\n\nJudge: Who ran after the truck?\n\nPlaintiff: We both did, but Dan was fast enough.\n\nJudge: Sorry, where am I going with that?\n\nPlaintiff: Right there.\n\nJudge: Yes. Sit on my lap, little boy, and tell me what you want for Christmas. No, you don't come up here. Have you never watched court before?\n\nPlaintiff: That was such a beautiful judge.\n\nJudge: All right. What did you see?\n\nPlaintiff's Friend (Dan): Well, we were walking out of the apartment, and that's when we saw the truck go by and we heard the noise. Then we basically started running. I'm pretty quick.\n\nPlaintiff: He's fast. I used to run cross country.\n\nDan: He's way faster than I am.\n\nJudge: But you couldn't catch up with it?\n\nDan: Correct. But he got some of the license plate and I got some of it, so we put it together.\n\nJudge: Then when you guys came back to the car, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: When we came back to the car, we put the bags in the trunk. Then I realized someone had left a note. A Good Samaritan left a note with the information.\n\nJudge: You have the actual note?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I do.\n\nJudge: May I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: Thank you. The Good Samaritan didn't leave his or her name and number?\n\nPlaintiff: Nope. They actually got the name of the company wrong, but they got most of the plates. That was good. It helped us.\n\nJudge: All right. What happened next?\n\nDefendant: Well, my dispatcher called me around 9:30 on the radio and said Mr. Javier said one of our trucks side swiped his mirror coming down 85th Street. I told him I have no recollection of ever coming down 85th Street. Then he said I have Mr. Javier's number. So I called Mr. Javier.\n\nDefendant: As soon as I talked to Mr. Javier, he tells me, \"I'm a lawyer. This is a hit and run. I have witnesses.\"\n\nJudge: Are you a lawyer?\n\nPlaintiff: Law school.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, are you a lawyer?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.

A suspect wearing a dark hoodie and jeans was reported fleeing westbound. When I turned onto Maple Avenue, I saw Mr. Thompson matching the description.\n\nDefendant: Officer, is it possible that other individuals in the area also matched that description?\n\nOfficer Martinez: It is possible, but when I approached Mr. Thompson, he immediately ran. I pursued and detained him. In his possession was a black duffel bag containing various pieces of jewelry, which were later identified as stolen from the store.\n\nPlaintiff: Was the defendant able to provide an explanation for possessing the jewelry?\n\nOfficer Martinez: No, he refused to answer my questions.\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I move to exclude the defendant’s silence as evidence of guilt.\n\nJudge: Granted. The jury will disregard the defendant’s silence. Continue, Plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor. Officer, did you conduct any forensic analysis on the items recovered?\n\nOfficer Martinez: Yes, we processed the bag and found Mr. Thompson’s fingerprints on both the bag and the jewelry inside.\n\nDefendant: Officer, could these fingerprints have been placed on the items prior to the alleged robbery?\n\nOfficer Martinez: That is possible, but highly unlikely given the timeline and circumstances.\n\nJudge: I’m finding in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,800 in rent as well as the car damage.

{"id": "912", "dialogue": "Judge:\nThe plaintiff Rachel Bremol is suing the defendants, Carol and Shawn Davenport, for $600. She claims that they owe her money for flowers provided at their wedding. She argues that no matter what she does, she can't get them to pay. She says the defendants went on vacation and spent money all over town but refuse to pay her for the services she provided. She is suing for $600—$400 for the flowers and $200 for aggravation.\n\nPlaintiff (Rachel Bremol):\nWell, um, in a thousand words or less, I worked with Carol at a plant job company. We take care of interior plants, and she got engaged to Shawn in January of that year, 2013. She knew my flower background—I worked at a flower shop—and she liked my work I was doing with her at the company. So, she asked me to be their florist. She ended up leaving that company, and I was still working there. But we met a couple of times to discuss her flowers. We met for lunch at a brewery. She invited me out to the warehouse of the company she went to work for to get silk flowers from her company, and I did several arrangements for her.\n\nJudge:\nWas there a contract between you two?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, it was all verbal.\n\nJudge:\nSo, what was the agreement?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe kept talking, and she kept saying, \"I want this, I want that,\" then things would change. She wanted personal flowers—fresh flowers like the bouquet, the bridesmaid flowers, flowers for the men, and a big, huge mantle piece over the fireplace of fresh flowers. She provided the silk flowers, the artificial ones from her company, to go into arrangements for things like lining the walkway for the Justice of the Peace. But I went to a wholesaler to get fresh flowers for all the personal things—like the bouquet.\n\nJudge:\nHow much were you supposed to get paid?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, we never really discussed it.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t discuss it? You’re just going to do business like that? And now, you come crying to me?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, that’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was very trusting.\n\nJudge:\nNo, no, no. You have a big \"S\" on your forehead. You're a sucker. You're doing a job you expect to get paid for, but you didn’t agree on a price.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I admit it.\n\nJudge:\nSo, why would you do that as a business?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, we were friends.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you’re saying because you were friends, you didn’t want to bring up money?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWell, let me tell you, you need to have a figure in your head, especially if you want to spend $1,200 on flowers. Did you ever bring up the price?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt came up the day of the wedding. She said she spent too much on other things and asked if she could pay me later in installments.\n\nJudge:\nDid you agree to that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, because I thought she was going to be my boss, and I trusted her.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever ask her what she owed?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I did.\n\nJudge:\nYou never mentioned how much was owed?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nSo, when you decided to sue, how much did you think you were owed?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI thought I was owed $600, $400 for the flowers and $200 for aggravation.\n\nJudge:\nSo, why did you wait until three years after the wedding?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI was patient, but after a while, I got tired of waiting.\n\nJudge:\nSo, when you quit, that’s when you decided to file the lawsuit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how much have you been paid?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey paid me $100 in September 2013, $100 in February 2014, and $100 again.\n\nJudge:\nSo, $300 in total.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou have no proof of these payments.\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, it was in cash.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you never gave her a receipt?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I didn’t.\n\nJudge:\nWhat about the invoice?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI gave her a handwritten invoice.\n\nJudge:\nSo you were paid $300, but you say you’re owed $600.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nThis case has become quite complicated. The defendant says you paid them more, but there’s no proof, and the contract was unclear. You’ve done a lot of things informally, and it's hard to figure out exactly how much was agreed upon.\n\nDefendant (Carol Davenport):\nWe didn’t have a written contract. We were friends, and she said she’d charge us for materials plus labor.\n\nJudge:\nDid she ever mention a specific price?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, but she did tell us it would be around $300 at one point.\n\nJudge:\nDid she ever give you an invoice?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, I don’t recall receiving an invoice.\n\nJudge:\nBut you kept paying her money. Why?\n\nDefendant:\nWe thought we owed her, but we didn’t know how much.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you paid her $300, $150, and $250?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but we never got a clear invoice, and it was hard to track how much was actually owed.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you have no receipts for these payments?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you’re both claiming you don’t know what’s owed. This is where things get confusing. You didn’t have a contract, you didn’t discuss a price, and now you’re both here arguing about what’s owed.\n\nDefendant (Shawn Davenport):\nYes, it’s been a mess.\n\nJudge:\nIn this case, the plaintiff has the burden of proof, but there’s no solid evidence for what was agreed upon. It’s very difficult to determine what’s owed or if anything is owed at all.\n\nJudge (to Plaintiff):\nYou’re the one suing, so it’s up to you to prove that the defendants owe you money. However, you’ve failed to provide proof that they owe you more than what they’ve already paid.\n\nJudge (to Defendant):\nYou’ve also failed to prove that you paid the full amount. You can’t just hand over cash without a receipt or documentation.\n\nJudge:\nThe lack of documentation and the informal nature of your agreement makes this case very difficult to resolve.

{"id": "340", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant gave away her expensive pottery equipment without her authorization. But the defendant says the plaintiff gave her orders to 86 it. It’s the case of \"You're Kiln-ing Me.\"\n\nJudge: Lisa Lynn Berra, you’re suing Nicole and Christopher Domini for $3,975.40 in pottery equipment—a kiln, pottery wheels, toolkits, etc.—that you had in their possession and that they, according to you, inappropriately disposed of. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, actually, in 2008, when I was pregnant, the father of my son and I were moving out of a storage unit. He went ahead and took that equipment over to their house without my knowledge.\n\nJudge: Without your knowledge?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. He thought it would be—I mean, this was my most valuable equipment—and he took it over to their house. I’m not sure why he did that.\n\nJudge: Did you ask him?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked him, and he just kind of took liberties like that. That’s why he’s not in our life anymore.\n\nJudge: All right, but when you asked him, what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"Oh, I took it over to Chris and Nikki’s house.\"\n\nJudge: In order to do what with it at Chris and Nikki’s?\n\nPlaintiff: In order to store it there. Apparently, he had sought permission from Chris and Nikki to leave it at their house for storage.\n\nJudge: Is that what you were saying?\n\nDefendant Christopher: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: All right, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to talk to them after I found out. This was around November 2008.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: They agreed that it would be okay—a verbal agreement—that it would be okay to keep it there.\n\nJudge: Tell me about what both sides discussed.\n\nPlaintiff: It was kind of—you know, it was a verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: No, I don’t want any more conclusions. I want to know what you said and what they said. If you don’t remember, just give me the gist of it.\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t remember exactly, but it seemed to be okay to have it there.\n\nJudge: What did you guys discuss about when you would take your stuff out of their storage?\n\nPlaintiff: It was kind of a loose verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: A verbal agreement to what? That you’d leave your stuff there for free? For how long?\n\nPlaintiff: Until I could come and get it or until they could bring it to me.\n\nJudge: And when did you finally get around to coming and getting it?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I tried to get it in 2010. Then I had an altercation with Nikki, and it was right around then that I was ready to have it because I had moved a couple of times and had a little baby on my own. Then, I finally bought a house and had a place for it. I called them. I called Chris right after we had our altercation, and I told him on the phone that I wanted to make a plan to get my belongings back.\n\nJudge: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said that they were in Florida.\n\nJudge: When was that? What month and year?\n\nPlaintiff: That was July 2010.\n\nJudge: So what does Chris say to you?\n\nPlaintiff: He said that he would be happy to do that. They were really busy because they were on a trip in Florida, and when he got back from his trip, he would help me take care of it.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Then Nikki called right away from his phone.\n\nJudge: And she started yelling at you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant Nicole: Actually, we weren’t in Florida; we were in New Jersey burying Christopher’s grandmother.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry to hear that. So you called her back?\n\nDefendant Nicole: I asked her not to call us back because we were in New Jersey burying his grandmother.\n\nJudge: So what happened? Did you ever get the stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: And how long did it stay in their shop?\n\nDefendant Christopher: From December 2008 until June 2011, when I donated it to the school district.\n\nJudge: What did you do between July 2010 and June 2011?\n\nDefendant Christopher: I had a lot of personal things going on.\n\nJudge: Okay. But then you finally got rid of her stuff in June 2011. And now she’s suing you for $4,000. Why didn’t you just go get it?\n\nPlaintiff: I tried.\n\nJudge: Not hard enough. You left your stuff there for years. How long do you think you have free storage?\n\nPlaintiff: I had a lot of personal things going on, and my child was in the hospital.\n\nJudge: And I’m sorry for that, but it doesn’t change your obligations.

She was outraged, demanded a refund, and is suing for the return of her $500.\nANNOUNCER: This is the defendant.

The defendant says it was an imitation Tiffany lamp, and she knew it.\nIt’s the case of You Don’t Light Up My Life.\nThank you, Douglas.\nChrista Burkhart Vigil?\nPLAINTIFF: Yes.\nJUDGE: You are suing the defendant’s store. You've asked us not to mention your last name or the store’s name, so we will refer to you as \"\"plaintiff\"\" and \"\"defendant.\"\" You are suing for $500, a deposit you put down on a lamp that you no longer want to buy.\nTell me what happened.\nPLAINTIFF: I went by the store and saw a lamp I liked very much. I went in a couple of days later and wanted to buy it. The lamp I originally saw was too tall for our apartment, so I saw another one that was just perfect. The salesperson showed it to me, and I said I’d take it.\nI came back the next day—it was pouring rain, and my husband couldn’t really find a parking spot on Austin Street in Kew Gardens. So, I went in, gave them a $500 deposit—\nJUDGE: Because you wanted to make sure they didn’t sell the lamp?\nPLAINTIFF: Right. And then, I said I’d come back the next day. Now, I work as a tour guide in the city, and I have a crazy schedule, so I couldn’t come back the next day. I came back a couple of days later, and the salesperson I had spoken to wasn’t there. Richie, another salesperson, was also not in.\nSo, I did not want to buy the lamp that day because nobody could really help me with it. We came back on the 4th of January—\nJUDGE: Okay, just a few days after you put the deposit down.\nPLAINTIFF: Yes. I had the money in my pocket to pay the difference, but I had been thinking about it. There was no evidence on the lamp—like where it was manufactured or where it came from—so I asked.\nThey told me, \"\"We never do that.\"\" Then, they put the owner of the store on the phone. I asked him about the lamp’s history, and he said, \"\"I’ll write you down anything you want,\"\" but there was no printed evidence.\nSo I said, \"\"I’m not spending $900 on something I have no background on.\"\"\nJUDGE: Well, it sounds like you had already decided to spend $900 on something you didn’t know the background of because you had already paid a $500 deposit.\nPLAINTIFF: I did, but I was a little impulsive. I get carried away very easily.\nJUDGE: So, she wants to invoke the \"\"carried away\"\" exception to deposits at your store.\nTell me what your store policy is.\nDEFENDANT: My store policy—can I show you?\nJUDGE: Sure, approach.\nDEFENDANT: Thank you.\nWe have a lot of impulse buyers—\nJUDGE: What kind of store is this?\nDEFENDANT: It started as a gift shop, but I expanded into furniture and clothing. We sell all kinds of art and new stuff.\nJUDGE: New stuff? No used?\nDEFENDANT: No, it’s all new. Once in a while, I get a vintage piece of furniture I love, but everything is new.\nJUDGE: Okay.\nDEFENDANT: She came in and fell in love with the lamp.\nJUDGE: Was that lamp something you came into, or something you bought from a vendor?\nDEFENDANT: We purchased a whole lot of lamps from a vendor who was manufacturing them in Mexico. The first day she came in, I explained to her that the glass is from Germany, and it’s manufactured in Mexico.\nOriginally, the price was $1,800. But since I figured she was an impulse buyer, I said, \"\"$800 takes it.\"\"\nShe was shaking for it, but her husband said, \"\"Let’s go have dinner first.\"\" Then, when she came back, I wasn’t there. Later, she called and my manager said she was upset and wanted a warranty.\nSo I said, \"\"I’ll give you any warranty you want—it’s a lamp, what can go wrong with it?\"\"\nShe asked, \"\"How much warranty?\"\" I said, \"\"Is one year good enough?\"\"\nThen, she changed the subject. She wanted to know where it was made and asked for a printed story. I told her, \"\"It’s not a real Tiffany lamp.\"\"\nJUDGE: Did she think it was a Tiffany lamp?\nDEFENDANT: You can ask her.\nJUDGE: Did you think it was a Tiffany lamp?\nPLAINTIFF: No.\nJUDGE: Well, now what?\nPLAINTIFF: I would like my money back.\nJUDGE: Of course you would, honey, but you don’t get your money back because the receipt where you put your deposit specifically says \"\"no refunds.\"\"\nPLAINTIFF: But this is not a layaway. This was a deposit.\nJUDGE: I don’t care. What do you think a deposit means?\nA deposit means you’re paying him $500 so that he doesn’t sell the lamp to anybody else. And he didn’t. He did his part. Why should you just be able to take it back?\nPLAINTIFF: I don’t know if the lamp is still there.\nJUDGE: Is the lamp still there?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, it’s still there.\nJUDGE: Okay, go visit it—it’s your lamp.\nCan she use the $500 to buy something different?\nDEFENDANT: Your Honor, we are a neighborhood store, and I love my customers. I want them to be happy, especially her—she’s very dramatic, like an actress.\nJUDGE: He says he loves his customers. You have a $500 credit there. You can either buy the lamp or use the $500 to buy something else.\nBut he has no legal obligation to give you back the cash. Your deposit is non-refundable, as your receipt clearly says.\nNext time, don’t be an impulse buyer.\nPLAINTIFF: Okay.\nJUDGE: Verdict for the defendant.

Um, and you think she did that because... Oh, you—you can stand up front and center, honey. Because you are—you’re dating him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And he used to live with you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** And how long did he live with you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** From July 2017 until March 2018.\n\n**Judge:** So how did the breakup happen? How did you—\n\n**Plaintiff:** Um, I called the police after he assaulted me.\n\n**Judge:** How did he assault you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He was moving things in my house. He hit me in my left eye—\n\n**Judge:** Punched you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am. Well, slapped me in my left eye. And when, um, the police arrived—we waited a while for the police to arrive—and when they did, before they did, he cut his own arm and told me that he was going to tell the police when they arrived that I did that.\n\n**Judge:** Did the police arrest anybody?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Did you get a restraining order?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Um, did you expect him to move in with the lady next door?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I did not.\n\n**Judge:** So now, how is it that the fellow living with your neighbor ends up being your boy—is there an age difference here?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** What's the age difference?\n\n**Plaintiff:** 25 years.\n\n**Judge:** And how does he end up living with you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He had come to my gate one time asking me if there was any work that he could do for me where he could make some money. And I said, \"Well, yes, there are some things that you could do for me,\" and I hired him to do some work.\n\n**Judge:** What kind of work?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Cutting down a tree.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, I got it.\n\n**Plaintiff:** He mowed the grass. Just anything I needed doing, he would do.\n\n**Judge:** And then how did the romance happen?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, just—you know, we were just good friends.\n\n**Judge:** So how did the romance start?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The romance started after he had moved into my camper. I let him rent my camper, and he lived there for a while.\n\n**Judge:** Is he living in the camper now, or is he living in the house?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He's in the house.\n\n**Judge:** He has his own room in the house?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And how long has he been there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A year.\n\n**Judge:** A year?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A year.\n\n**Judge:** All right.

Well, according to you, he does, right?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** Who’s he seeing?\n\n**Defendant:** Uh, well, he saw me until I found out about her, which was August 2018.\n\n**Judge:** How did you—when you say \"until you found out about it,\" you knew he was living there?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** But you didn't think it was romantic?\n\n**Defendant:** No, ma'am. Why would I?\n\n**Judge:** So I take it you're not particularly close to your neighbor?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** You didn't know the living situation?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n(continues with extensive questioning and responses...)\n\n**Judge:** The bottom line is, after all of this, what do you think is going to happen now?\n\n**Defendant:** I mean, I am moving. My mother’s purchased a new home, and I will be moving. I do not have a desire to see Don. I don’t turn down that street to avoid him.

I bought the property in April of last year. The easement is shared, which is the driveway, a shared driveway.\nPlaintiff: Picture of the house? Yes, that's what I'm asking.\nJudge: Okay, so which one is this? Is your house the one on the left?\nPlaintiff: Yes, that's his house, and that's the one we're talking about. So a car can get through here and park in the back of each place, right?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay, but apparently, we have a problem because he lets his dogs roam loose. Is it one dog or more than one dog?\nPlaintiff: He had one dog at first, and I talked to him about the problem, and then he went and got a second dog.\nJudge: Okay, and what's the problem?\nPlaintiff: We cannot use the property that I paid for, for my family, because of his menacing dogs.\nJudge: Are the dogs aggressive? Is that what you're trying to say?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: How are the dogs aggressive?\nPlaintiff: You know, if you go to talk to me, you gotta come on up—who are you?\nPlaintiff's Wife (Janice): I'm Janice, his wife.\nJudge: Okay, so these are your children we're talking about?\nPlaintiff's Wife: Yes.\nJudge: Let me just ask you, is there an additional fence in the back to separate your two properties or no?\nPlaintiff's Wife: No, recently, we did that.\nPlaintiff: But at the time that we're talking about this, there was no additional fence. So if your daughters want to use their own backyard, what you're saying is, you can't because the dogs are roaming everywhere?\nPlaintiff's Wife: They can't.\nJudge: Is that true?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay.\nJudge: What right do you have to have the dogs roaming free in a way that they can actually get on his property too?\nDefendant (Marcelo Miranda): First of all, I've been there 20 years.\nJudge: I don't care if you've been there for 20 years.\nDefendant: I'm just explaining.\nJudge: You can explain all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that the issue is these dogs.\nDefendant: When Christopher Columbus came, the first time he came to see the house, he met me with a shovel in my hand, and I was picking up the dog poop.\nDefendant: I asked him if it was going to be a problem. He told me the dog was fine. He petted the dog, his wife petted the dog. The dogs are not aggressive.\nJudge: Listen to me, you can't have dogs roaming loose in an area that you share with another person that is not exclusively your property. If that's the case, you can't have the dogs outside. Lots of people have their dogs inside and walk them many times a day. The fact that your property is set up this way, it would be really inconvenient to pen my side in. Think about that before you bought two boxers. It's a problem.\nDefendant: I don't care what you're talking about.\nJudge: How can you not know this is a problem? Are you surprised by what I'm saying?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: What efforts did you make to try to resolve this before it got here?\nDefendant: To me, the complaints that he gave me were the dog droppings. The other thing is he doesn't live on the property. He only uses it as what?\nPlaintiff: I don't live there full time.\nDefendant: He made single occupancy rooms in the house, and he wants to do the same thing in the basement.

I said, \"Why haven’t you done that before we got here?\"\nPlaintiff: He’s suing you.\nDefendant: I asked him where he came up with these numbers. Before he bought the house, he thought you'd be better about picking up the poop.\nJudge: You’re suing for the defendant’s dogs pooping on your lawn. You had to hire a professional to clean it up. Why are you suing for $1,400 for poo pickup?\nPlaintiff: In June, I had to hire a neighbor to do the cleanup, which I paid, roughly $100 a month.\nJudge: So you're paying a neighbor $100 a month to pick up a few logs of poop in a yard that is how big?\nPlaintiff: In the driveway.\nJudge: Okay, so a few yards.\nDefendant: Did he do it for $100 a month?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: How big is the yard?\nDefendant: Is that the guy you paid $100 bucks?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Come on up, everyone wants to meet you.\nPlaintiff’s Hired Helper (BR Medina): Yes, I got paid $100 a month.\nJudge: Did you get paid $1,400 to pick up dog feces?\nHelper: No, I was paid $100 a month from June 2011 to August.\nJudge: Did you do anything else besides pick up the poop?\nHelper: Yes, I had to clear the drain when it was clogged. The dog poop went down there.\nJudge: Why aren't they citing him? Why isn't the city citing him?\nPlaintiff: They said it’s a private property issue.\nJudge: So you need to pursue this with the city. If it becomes a nuisance, that’s where you need to go.\nJudge: Are you satisfied with your claim of $1,400?\nPlaintiff: I believe it’s justified.\nJudge: Let me see the pictures of the door.\nPlaintiff: Here's the door that got ruined.\nJudge: Wait, wait. Let me go ahead and talk to you.\nDefendant: The fence was built after the fact.\nJudge: I understand that, but the fact remains, you can’t continue to let your dogs run loose on a shared property.\nPlaintiff: That’s a problem, Your Honor.\nJudge: I am finding in favor of the plaintiff. The amount won’t be the full amount they’re suing for, but I am awarding $2,000 to the plaintiff for the dog cleanup and other issues.\nJudge: The dogs may not be vicious, but they are a nuisance.

She asked me if she could come and stay at my place.\n\nJudge: Had you talked to each other in all that time?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh yeah, we had talked to each other. Like I said, she was a friend.\n\nSo I allowed her to come to my place, where she stayed, and it was like a living hell.\n\nJudge: Who lived with you?\n\nPlaintiff: I live alone.\n\nJudge: Alone? Okay, so she comes alone?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, at the time. But a couple of days later, I ended up in the hospital.\n\nJudge: What necessitated the double mastectomy? Did you have cancer?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I went to Tijuana and had some silicone injected into my breasts, and it gave me issues. So they had to remove it, put implants and stuff like that.\n\nSo I came home. I was fine. She was there; she did help me out a lot, seeing as I just had those surgeries.\n\nBut she started all these live videos—she wants to be Facebook famous—and she does a lot of live videos where she's screaming and hollering, playing these songs just all day, all night.\n\nBoys in and out of my place. In and out. Different boys all the time.\n\nJudge: How long was this arrangement going to last?\n\nPlaintiff: She was only supposed to be there two months. She came in November.\n\nJudge: Was she helping out with the rent?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, she tried to. I wouldn’t accept it. So I said, \"You keep that for yourself, put it up—that way you can move next month like you're supposed to.\"\n\nSo she left, went to a nephew—a friend of ours. She said she wasn’t coming back to my home. She was like, \"I'm gone, I'm going to give you your space,\" blah blah blah.\n\nSo she was gone about a week.\n\nThen she came back. She just popped up at my house one day while I was getting dressed.\n\nPlaintiff Describes Altercation\nPlaintiff: So I said, \"When we leave, you have to leave.\" That’s what I told her.\n\nI said, \"I don't want anyone in my house. I cleaned my house spotless because it was horrible—I had to bleach it and do all the things, honey.\"\n\nSo I said, \"I don't want nobody in my house. My house is clean, and when I leave and come back, I want it to stay that way.\"\n\nSo she—she—that didn’t sit well with her. She got irate. She got up in my face, told me to \"put my dukes up,\" she was going to beat my ass.\n\nJudge: Connie, were you there when that happened?\n\nConnie: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you tell me what happened?\n\nConnie: Well, we came back. Christina got mad, and she said, \"We could fight, I want to beat your ass anyway. I’ve been wanting to beat your ass for many years,\" and whoop whoop and whoop whoop.\n\nThey was arguing and all that.\n\nJudge: Did they actually hit each other?\n\nConnie: No, not at that point.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, what happened was I had to call the police because she told me, \"Well, B, I'm not going nowhere.\"\n\nSo she told the police, \"Look, I got my ID here. You need to bobblehead.\"\n\nThe police told me, \"Well, she's a resident there, nothing we can do.\"\n\nPlaintiff’s Restraining Order\nPlaintiff: So I left.\n\nThe very next morning, 7:00 AM, I went to court and got a restraining order.\n\nJudge: And the restraining order was based on what?\n\nPlaintiff: Based on the battery—because she had, at one point, pushed me. She didn’t hit me; she pushed my head. I hit the door seal, and I had a lump.\n\nJudge: When had she done that, supposedly?\n\nPlaintiff: The second time when I came, 'cause I left and came back.\n\nSo I had somebody serve her that very same day.\n\nJudge: So once she was served the restraining order, she left your house?\n\nPlaintiff: She didn’t leave immediately. I didn’t have a sheriff give the restraining order. I had my next-door neighbor serve her the restraining order.\n\nSo he gave her the restraining order.\n\nJudge: The broken car windows—$450.\n\nThe wig—$641.74.\n\nThe jacket—we’re going to make arrangements for that.\n\nThe cable bill—$327.57—subtracted from the total leaves a net judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $316.71.\n\nJudge: Let’s not put ourselves in a situation again where all kinds of bad things happen that we can't prove one way or the other.\n\nFinal Comments\nDefendant: If I see her again, I’m going to beat her down.\n\nPlaintiff: I have a restraining order. She will go to jail.\n\nJudge: That will do it for this case. Litigants for the next case on the way into the courtroom right now.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "character attack, playing the victim, gaslighting, dismissal, deflection"}

August 24th, I was in my car, parked. Keys on the dash, car shut off, windows down.\n\n**[Judge]**  \nYeah.\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nBecause I have a smart car, and if you have the windows down, you have to turn the car off, or the car will go *ding ding ding ding*.

I want to see—I hope he didn’t damage my car. We look down. We see that it’s scraped the front bumper. So I said to him, “What’s wrong with you?!” I probably cursed. I don’t—\n\n**[Judge]**  \nWho cursed?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**  \nI probably cursed. I was upset. And I said, “Look!

Mr. Whitman, you are representing Southshore Power Squadron as command and suing Ilana Vasquez for $180 for four persons' admissions to a Halloween party back in 2015. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, actually, 2014 was the Halloween party, and we did the Halloween party in conjunction with the local yacht club.\n\nJudge:\nWhat is Southshore Power Squadron?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe are an educational organization teaching safe boating through education. We’ve been in existence since November 10, 1928—just celebrated our 90th anniversary.\n\nJudge:\nOh, good for you guys. All right, so you had this Halloween party in 2014.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I stand corrected.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, the treasury collected money from the participants, which included the defendant as well as other members of the squadron. They paid the fee via check to our treasurer. He, in turn, I in turn, turned over a check for the amount of money collected to the yacht club.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nUnfortunately, this involved an evening of open bar, 15-16 dishes of food—\n\nJudge:\nWas everybody in costume?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, in costume. Prizes for best costumes.\n\nJudge:\nDid everybody participate, or did some people come not in costume?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, everybody participated.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have pictures of your costume?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you go as?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOh boy, it was so long ago I don’t remember.\n\nJudge:\nCome on, you dress up every Halloween. You remember.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI think it was a doctor’s uniform.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So, they paid, and then what happened with your treasurer?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, what he did is he put the checks in a folder, similar to what these are, put it away, and forgot about it. It wasn’t until April or May of 2016 that he realized the checks were never deposited.\n\nJudge:\nBy this time, the checks had gone dead?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, they’re stale.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did he not deposit them? You mean none of the checks or just some of them?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNone.\n\nJudge:\nIs he still your treasurer?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWas he still treasurer after this debacle?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nHow much longer?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, I’ll explain that. Everyone gave replacement checks.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe did the same thing again.\n\nJudge:\nAre you kidding me?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I’m being very honest.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did the accountant get fired?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe only resigned about three months ago.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you keep him for so long?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe’re a volunteer organization. Nobody is paid.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI took over again in 2017. In July 2017, we realized two checks were still outstanding, one of which was the defendant’s.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Ms. Vasquez, you went to the party, had fun, and wrote a check. Then they asked you for a replacement check, and you gave them one. Then they asked for another, and you gave them another. And now they want another one.\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy won’t you pay again?\n\nDefendant:\nIf I give you a check and you forget to cash it, do I still owe you the money? I don’t think so.\n\nJudge:\nGoing inside the courtroom...\n\nDefendant:\nIt’s not a matter of not paying. Each of us gave them a check of $90 the night of the party. Then we also paid a second time. Now they’re asking for a fourth check.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, I don’t blame you for being frustrated. Did you quit the organization?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, in 2018.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you got a letter from Mr. Whitman?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, and it was insulting.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nIt was aggressive.

Yes, I’ll order that too.\n\nJudge:\nBut here’s a word of advice: I tell my children, “Say it, forget it; write it, regret it.” Assume that what you write will be interpreted in the worst way possible.

{"id": "747", "dialogue": "Judge:\nThis is the plaintiff, Aila Brebnor. She says she was driving down the street one day and she saw the defendant drop his wallet out of his car on the next block. She caught up with him and informed him where he dropped his wallet. The guy opened his car door, striking her side view mirror, and he knocked the thing clean off her car. The defendant now refuses to repair her car. Her good deed’s not going to cost her the $500 she’s owed, so she’s suing.\n\nJudge:\nThis is the defendant, Deid. He says the plaintiff got all crazy because the mirror fell off her car and he said he’d have it fixed if she sent him an invoice from a reputable repair shop. She told him it was going to cost 160 bucks. Then, next thing he knows, her father calls him, ranting and raving, demanding $500 from him. He feels as though he’s being conned. He didn’t even touch the girl’s mirror, and he wants to let the judge decide what’s right. He’s accused of sideswiping a girl.\n\nJudge:\nAll parties, please use your seats.\n\nClerk:\nThis litigant has been affirmed.\n\nJudge:\nThank you. You’re welcome. Okay, Akila Brebnor, correct? You are suing Deid for $500, $152 of it to repair a damaged mirror and $348 for missed work. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nOkay, so we were driving down the street on the North Conduit. At that time, he’s sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle. He opens the door—\n\nJudge:\nWhile he’s driving?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nWhile he was sitting. He was at a red light.\n\nJudge:\nOh, he’s at a red light. Correct.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nThe door opens, his wallet falls out to the floor. The light turns green, I’m not able to step out to get it, so I continue to drive. I match up to like the passenger back door, and I’m like waving them down. His son opens the window and I said, \"Your wallet, your wallet!\" I drive up, I state to him, \"I said your wallet fell back there.\" He steps out.\n\nJudge:\nWho’s he? I’m sorry.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nThe defendant steps out.\n\nJudge:\nIs he the passenger or the driver?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nHe’s the passenger.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nHe steps out. Our car is like about this leveling, and that’s how close you are. As close as your hands are. He opens the door and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nIt taps my car mirror on the driver’s side. I say to him, \"Don’t open it, the light just turned green.\" Wait, so as my car rolls a little bit, he pushes it more, slides out from the car, and the mirror on my driver’s side just falls off.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, what happens then?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nHe starts running down North Conduit. His son screams “Pop” or “Dad” in their language, runs out the car with him. They’re running down to North Conduit. I stay to the driver, \"Do you have insurance? You have registration, something?\" He states, \"No, it’s not my car, it belongs to the defendant.\" I said, \"Okay, so we pull over to the side. I’m waiting for him to come back.\" He says he comes back and he states, \"I’m going to exchange my information with you.\" I said, \"Okay, well, do you have any insurance?\"\n\nJudge:\nNo insurance?\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nNo, I don’t have insurance. I’m like, \"Well, how don’t you have insurance?\"\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nWell, because the car belongs to the Air Force. I work for the Air Force. I’m a chaplain in the Air Force, and the car doesn’t belong to me.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nWho does the car belong to?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nMy ex-girlfriend.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nIs she in the Air Force?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nNo, I am.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nDid you tell her?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nWell then, why did you tell them the car belonged to the Air Force?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nI never told her that. It has Air Force plates.\n\nJudge:\nShe asked.\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nOkay, can I speak? First of all, I want to thank her for telling me about the wallet.\n\nJudge:\nDo you?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nYes. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Because we’re going to get there in a minute. She tells you about the wallet, you open the door, and you knock her mirror off. If it was me, if anybody did it, it was me.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So you exchange information, did you have insurance on the car?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nSure, your own. Has it. I gave it to the—\n\nJudge:\nOkay, did you give it to her?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nNo, why not?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nI didn’t have it on me.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, so now you are what to her?\n\nJudge:\nI’m her father.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, and you get involved when what happens?\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nWhen she called me and she told me that she had an accident, I drove to where she was. I was expecting to see him there, but she told me he left. I called him when I got there. I said, “Why did you leave?” He said, “I’m going to a wedding.” My response was, \"You had an accident. Did you exchange information?\" He said, \"No.\"\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nI said, \"What happened to the insurance?\"\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nI do not have insurance on the car.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nI said, \"So you’re driving in New York state without insurance?\" He says, \"Well, I don’t want to give you the insurance because it’s going to mess up my friend’s driving license. He wants to take care of it on his own.\"\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, this is what he said to me.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nAll right, and so then what happens? He decides he’s going to take care of it himself and he gives you some information to go to a place of his choosing. What happens when you get there?\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nSo after we’re having a conversation on the phone, he states that the person can put the mirror on for $40, and if that doesn’t work out, after going to the individual twice, because he says sometimes you have to go back twice to get the job done properly, he can silicone the mirror on himself because he’s a contractor engineer.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nSo he went from a chaplain to a contracting engineer now?\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nAre you a chaplain or a contracting engineer?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nBoth.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, I’m a licensed New York State engineer. He said he’s done them for 15 years and that he can silicone it himself, which I didn’t want to happen because the mirror works with air.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nYou need to give me a reason why you don’t want the guy who hit your car, who was careless enough to hit your car and knock your mirror off, to put your mirror back on. You don’t need to give me a reason why you don’t want to.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nSo I go to the individual he suggested. I went with my father. I did. I went with my father.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nThe individual did not have the mirror for my car. He tried to put a four-door mirror on my car. It wouldn’t work out, and it was black.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nSo we’re like, well, if you get the mirror for us, will you paint it?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nNo, I don’t paint. I just put it on and that’s it.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nSo he said, \"Give me about an hour and I’ll see if I can find somebody that has a two-door silver one or a black one, and if not, then there’s nothing I can do.\" We waited an hour. We waited longer than an hour. He never called us back.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nI went to my regular mechanic, who called within 5 minutes and was able to locate a mirror for my vehicle and also stated he can get it painted and put on without a problem.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, and he got it done for how much?\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\n$152.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, do you have the bill?\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nI do.\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nOkay, then now who contacts him to tell him, \"Hey, we’re going to do it our way and it’s $152.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nI spoke with him, and I stated that, you know, I got the car fixed. I’m able to send you the bill. Can I have your information? He goes, \"Well, first before I give it to you, how much does it cost?\" So I didn’t want to give him the approximate because I wanted to see what he was going to do. I said, \"Approximately $160.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Aila Brebnor):\nAnd he’s like, \"Okay, well I told you where to go, that’s too much money,\" and he starts yelling at me. Is when—and that’s when I hand the phone to my father to have the conversation with him.\n\nPlaintiff’s Father:\nOkay, so let’s put a pin in it and let me hear from you.\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nI have, by the way, I have some recordings of this whole conversation, with the father, with the thing, even with the $160.\n\nJudge:\nCan I just ask you a question? How much money was in your wallet?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nIn my wallet? No money. Actually, it was my ID cards and my credit cards.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s your time worth? Getting ID cards, cards, and credit cards again. I’m just kind of curious how it is that the young lady, who is the reason why you didn’t lose your wallet, has to go through all these hoops. Why is that? Over $10 and something bucks?\n\nDefendant (Deid):\nNo, no. I told her, and I have a conversation of that, too, that, \"I’m going to take care of it.\"\n\nJudge:\nThe court has heard everything. Here’s what I’m ruling. You’ve knocked her mirror off. You didn’t do anything to fix the mirror, to try to come to terms with fixing it. It’s your responsibility. I’m awarding the plaintiff $500 for the damage, and you’ll make sure the mirror gets repaired.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Evasion & Deflection,Gaslighting,Playing the Victim"}

And the police officer had his car, and he had his lights flashing.\n\nJudge: So?\n\nPlaintiff: And he was—\n\nJudge: What? In the intersection?\n\nPlaintiff: He’s in front of me.\n\nJudge: Trying to cut in front of you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: So I come to a stop because that’s the right thing to do.\n\nJudge: His lights are on?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Oh. Oh. Okay. Was the siren on?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh-huh.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So about five to ten seconds later, um, I just get hit from the—from behind. The same police officer stops to see that everything is okay with us. And, uh, what he told—what the police officer told me himself is that he saw my car stopped, and then it got launched forward, like it got hit.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did the police officer write a report?\n\nPlaintiff: The police officer said it was optional to write a report, um, just because it’s just whether—how we want to settle it. So we just made an agreement. Well, we got out of the cars, we inspected the damage, and I saw that my car had, uh—the bumper was cracked, the paint was chipped, and my muffler was broken. It was swaying left and right.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happened?\n\nDefendant: Well, that’s incorrect. What actually happened was, uh, Mr. Alan was driving in front of me, and the police car was coming perpendicular to him with the lights. The lights had just turned on, and there was no siren. So they slowed down almost to a stop, and Alan slowed down, so they were letting Alan go forward. But Alan hesitated, and the police officers—they had already stopped. So when he hesitated, I had to press on my brakes—\n\nJudge: Wait, wait. I don’t understand. If you saw everything you just said, why do you hit him? If you see everything you just said, you shouldn’t be hitting him, ‘cause your car shouldn’t be in motion.\n\nDefendant: I was moving approximately 3 mph.\n\nJudge: Even more reason that you could stop. If his car stopped, why wouldn’t you have time to stop before hitting him?\n\nDefendant: Because I pressed the brakes, and the water main that was broken—my vehicle, I was driving a Mercedes, and the ABS kicked in, and the vehicle just slid and just tapped him.\n\nJudge: Oh. So love tap?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it was a little love tap.\n\nJudge: Exactly what he called it in the answer—the little tap. I don’t know what you think love is, my friend. I’m going to tell you right now: you hit me with a car, it’s not love.\n\nDefendant: [Laughs]\n\nJudge: All right. So it’s your fault. It’s obviously your fault. What is it, his fault? Uh, how is it his fault?\n\nJudge (to audience member): So if the plaintiff stops abruptly because he hears a siren, and the defendant hits him, is the defendant responsible for the accident?\n\nAudience Member: Yes. Most—most definitely.\n\nJudge: Even if it’s an abrupt stop?\n\nAudience Member: Abrupt stop, sure, yes.\n\nJudge: There was sirens, so—\n\nAudience Member: Yeah, he’d be at fault. Um, and you’re supposed to have a length, you know, there—\n\nJudge: There you go! Ding! Going inside the courtroom.\n\nDefendant: It—it’s—it’s the city’s fault, it’s Alan’s fault, and it’s the police’s fault.\n\nJudge: I want to know how it’s Alan’s fault.\n\nDefendant: It’s Alan’s fault because he had the right—right of way. There was no emergency, there was—\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, are you telepathic? There’s a cop with the lights—\n\nDefendant: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —and it doesn’t matter. I know what you’re talking about. They were late for lunch. I know what you mean. But when a police officer has the sirens or the lights on, you, by law, have to give it passage. Why do you think they put it on?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: All right. So—so what did he do wrong?\n\nDefendant: He should have kept going when they stopped because the lights will flash.\n\nJudge: If he had kept going, they’d be giving him a ticket for not stopping for a sirening car!\n\nDefendant: How are they going to give him a ticket if they’re on their way to a supposedly emergency?\n\nJudge: Oh, so you think he might get away with it?\n\nDefendant: He should have taken the chance.\n\nJudge: Okay. Just stop. All right. So what happens out there? You guys strike a deal?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. So we got out of the car, we saw the damage, and he apologized to me for hitting the car.\n\nJudge: And you saw the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: He said it’s not that severe, but I told him that it needs to be reworked—the body part, uh, the bumper, and it has to be repainted.\n\nJudge: So you guys actually—what kind of car was this?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s a BMW 328.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so you guys actually come up with a figure. I said $250. Did you agree to pay him $250?\n\nDefendant: No. Actually, I agreed to pay him $200.\n\nJudge: Have you paid it?\n\nDefendant: I gave him $41.\n\nJudge: Did he give you $41?\n\nPlaintiff: He gave me $31.\n\nJudge: $31. And according to you, you agreed to pay what?\n\nDefendant: Uh, the balance due for—on—\n\nJudge: You agreed to pay the balance of—\n\nDefendant: $200—\n\nJudge: —you minus the $31. And have you paid it?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Why haven’t you paid it?\n\nDefendant: Because after I reflected on the situation and thought about—you know, Alan, very nice guy.\n\nJudge: Boy Next Door!\n\nDefendant: Boy Next Door.\n\nJudge: He called you—he looks like—exact—hold on, I’m going to read your exact words. \"The plaintiff is a nice guy. He looks like Tom Cruise in Risky Business.\"\n\nDefendant: That’s what I—\n\nJudge: The accident’s not my fault. You’re dating Tom Cruise! You should be very happy.\n\nDefendant: [Laughs]\n\nJudge: All right, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: I have a video of the agreement.\n\nJudge: Let’s play it.\n\n(Video plays, confirming $250 agreement.)\n\nJudge: Verdict for the plaintiff. $219.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, deflection, persuasion, emotional appeal"}
{"id": "5", "dialogue": "[Judge]: Thank you, Douglas. Alright, you want to be called just Gina?\n\n[Plaintiff]: Yes, ma’am.\n\n[Judge]: Gina, you are suing Alex Babayev and Metro Jewelers, that’s your company, correct, for $385, the amount you had to pay to fix a Bulgari watch when a screw went missing at his place. Tell me what happened.\n\n[Plaintiff]: Correct. On June 15th of 2015, I passed by Mr. Babayev’s store. I had passed it many times in the past, and at this particular time, my Bulgari watch needed a battery. So, I went inside, and the young lady, I told her it’s a Bulgari watch, and she said, “Oh, that's fine, we service Rolexes, we do all that.” So, that made me feel confident enough to take my watch off, give it to her, and she put it right in front of me on a little pad. She started taking apart the casing and doing whatever you need to do to change the battery. And, in the course of that moment, just sort of in front of all of us, this tiny little screw just went flying somewhere behind the counter. And everyone winds up on their knees, her other employees, looking for this little tiny screw.\n\n[Plaintiff]: Did you actually see it fly, because you were watching, or no?\n\n[Plaintiff]: Well, actually, I was just standing there, but didn’t quite see the moment when it—yes.\n\n[Plaintiff]: Okay. They were all looking for the screw, couldn’t find it. They took from a little broom out, started sweeping the floor and to no avail. So, I said, “What do you do now?” She says, “Oh, I’m sure we could find another screw to put in there.” So, I waited for a few moments. They looked in drawers and other places and couldn’t find another screw. They said, “Uh, I’m not going to leave the watch here.” I said, “Why? I speak to the boss, you lost my screw to the watch.” The boss came back, and he said, “Oh yeah, we can get it fixed for you. Just leave the watch.” At that point, I really didn’t feel very comfortable about leaving the watch. They Scotch taped my watch back together because it wouldn’t shut, so I was afraid of other pieces falling out of the watch. They Scotch taped it back, put it in a plastic bag. About two hours later, I get a call, “We found your screw.”\n\n[Plaintiff]: Oh, so I very excitedly ran back to the store with my Scotch taped watch, and it was the wrong screw. They started messing with it and playing with it, and the screw did not fit.\n\n[Judge]: Wait, where did we find that screw? Did we actually find that screw, or we found a screw we could use?\n\n[Defendant]: It was a screw that we found that we could use.\n\n[Plaintiff]: So she paid $385 for the screw?\n\n[Defendant]: Absolutely. She paid a lot of money for a screw. She brought it in for a battery. He lost the screw. He’s responsible. It’s a lot of money.\n\n[Judge]: Yeah, does she get the $385?\n\n[Defendant]: Yes, really?\n\n[Judge]: Does she get the $385 if she paid that much to get the exact same screw back? But is it reasonable to pay $385 to this guy for losing the screw?\n\n[Defendant]: Uh, depends on what kind of contract they have.\n\n[Judge]: Nobody wants to say yes here. Nobody wants to say yes. Going inside the courtroom, we have a lot of screws. So, you lost a screw. Nobody found the screw that popped out. In order to find the right screw, she would have had to leave the watch because the threads are all different, right?\n\n[Defendant]: Right.\n\n[Judge]: But nobody found the screw that actually popped out?\n\n[Defendant]: No, even to this day, nobody’s found it. It is so tiny. It’s unbelievable.\n\n[Judge]: How much did your Bulgari watch cost?\n\n[Plaintiff]: This watch was in the thousands. It was a gift to me, and it was in the thousands, and I’ve had it for many years.\n\n[Judge]: Are you an authorized Bulgari watch repair place?\n\n[Defendant]: No.\n\n[Judge]: Why were you taking your several thousand dollar watch to an unauthorized dealer that wasn’t authorized?\n\n[Plaintiff]: Over the years, changing the battery was just something very basic that, and why are you opening up an incredibly expensive watch? You’re not—I mean, maybe that's like a function of that watch where you have to be very careful with it. Maybe you should have a sneeze guard, you know, so that if something goes flying, we can stop it. I don’t know.\n\n[Defendant]: No, we fix all kinds of watches, Rolexes, Breitlings. I mean, some of them are easy, some of them are technical.\n\n[Judge]: Okay, so at this point, you have no faith, and so you take the watch to Bulgari?\n\n[Plaintiff]: I asked the employee to please sign something, and she wrote, “Screw lost in store by me,” because I’m sure she felt awful. I’m sure she did. And then I took the watch to Bulgari, and they looked it over, and it took several weeks.\n\n[Defendant]: I don’t think you’ll pay if you’re taking it there. It’s not going to be a $20 screw, right?\n\n[Plaintiff]: Well, that’s what Mr. Babayev believed, that he could just send it to whoever, and they were just going to fix it. I didn’t know whether they would put in the right parts or approved parts for that watch, seeing as what happened at the store. So, that was where they charged you then $385 because you can’t just buy a screw according to you?\n\n[Defendant]: That’s what I said. Can you give me a screw? I asked them because he asked me to ask the Bulgari store, and they said they cannot.\n\n[Judge]: Okay. And did you ever call the Bulgari store once you realized you were being sued to see if it was possible to just buy the screw?\n\n[Defendant]: No, basically, they usually charge you more just to get—they charge you more for the maintenance. They’re in the business of making the $385 for the battery change. They change your gaskets. They—but that’s the only way to get the part that they lost back in there.\n\n[Defendant]: Exactly. They needed to do their thing before they could give me back the watch whole.\n\n[Judge]: Okay. What is your defense?\n\n[Defendant]: Yes, we lost a screw, but it’s not a $385 screw. It doesn’t—you know, I don’t deny it. I told her I would replace it. I do have a watchmaker on the premises. He comes in Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I would have charged nothing for it because I know it’s my fault. To compensate for her loss and everything, I’ll take care of it, not even charging for the battery. She said, “No, I don’t trust you. I don’t want to do that.” So, I really signed saying that, you know, if you could bring me the screw, I’ll put it in. Not the $385.\n\n[Judge]: Honestly speaking, right?\n\n[Defendant]: Sensible.\n\n[Judge]: So, how much does changing a battery cost? If everything had gone well, what would that cost?\n\n[Defendant]: On her watch, it’s basically around $10-$15 depending on the size of the battery.\n\n[Judge]: Right, but what about the fact that this is a really expensive watch, and that she has no idea what’s going to happen a year from now with the wrong screw in there? What about the fact that none of it is her fault?\n\n[Defendant]: I mean, there are screws, and then there are screws, I guess. Yeah.\n\n[Judge]: And that’s kind of the risk you run when you open up a several thousand-dollar watch and lose the screw. Only one screw would fit that; otherwise, the whole mechanism is gone. That’s why I have a watch guy on the premises. He fixes all kinds of watches, certified watch technician. I don’t have him on a daily basis because he has other jobs that he does Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is the only time I have him.\n\n[Defendant]: I hear you, and I understand what you’re saying, and it seems kind of harsh. But by the same token, I hear her, and she’s blameless. And she lost faith, you know, and she doesn’t want you to compensate her by paying her $10 because she was only able to put the watch back together by taking it to Bulgari. But you’re saying, “Well, no, judge, she would have been able to put the watch together again. She just needed to leave it with me and give me a chance.”\n\n[Judge]: And that’s where the rub is. Does she have to leave it with you? Because that’s reasonable, and that’s the only thing she should be able to do, and that’s the only thing you should be held accountable for.\n\n[Judge]: Does she have to leave her several thousand-dollar watch with you guys when she’s already brought it there once, you lost a screw, you made her come back, and then it turns out it was the wrong screw, and she’s done with you? And I don’t think she does.\n\n[Judge]: I don’t think she does. I’m going to deduct $15, which is what she would have paid at your place, and I’m going to order you to pay her $370.

{"id": "505", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff Dawn Harper. She says she rented an apartment from the slumlord defendant who didn't tell her the house was in foreclosure. When the new owners came in, they told her they were going to kick her out. The unscrupulous defendant hasn't returned her security deposit. She's not going to let this guy get away with stealing her money and is suing him today in this court for the $1,600 she's owed.\n\n**Judge:** This is the defendant DeMarco. He says he sold the place the plaintiff lived in and let her live out the last month of rent with her security deposit, which she did. How she thinks she’s still owed this money is comical, he thinks, and soon the judge will think the same. He’s accused of trying to rip off a tenant.\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says her landlord secretly sold the house she was renting, and the new landlord won't give her security deposit back. But the defendant says they're even. It’s the case of insecurity deposit.\n\n**Judge:** Ms. Harper, you are suing your former landlord, Mr. DeMarco, for $1,600 in a security deposit that he refuses to return. What's going on?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, he says that I lived out my security, and I didn’t.\n\n**Judge:** Let’s back up. You rented a place from him for how long?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Two years.\n\n**Judge:** And you lived where?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Upstairs on the second floor, and he lived underneath on the first floor.\n\n**Judge:** And when was the first time you realized something had gone terribly wrong?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I was notified in the mail by the new owners of the property. They told me I needed to contact them for any further information.\n\n**Judge:** So what happened, Mr. DeMarco?\n\n**Defendant:** I sold the property.\n\n**Judge:** You sold it, or you got foreclosed on?\n\n**Defendant:** I sold the property.\n\n**Judge:** A short sale?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** If it was a short sale, you were already in foreclosure proceedings with the bank, right?\n\n**Defendant:** That’s correct.\n\n**Judge:** Did you ever let her know about that?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Did he ever let you know about that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** Did you have a lease?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** When did you do the short sale?\n\n**Defendant:** June 20th, 2018.\n\n**Judge:** So she says you owe her. You’re no longer living there, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** So she wants her security deposit back. What’s your defense?\n\n**Defendant:** On May 1st, I explained to her that she no longer has to pay rent. I was going to sell the property in June, and when that happens, she should start packing her things and find a new place.\n\n**Judge:** So did she pay June rent?\n\n**Defendant:** She only paid for May.\n\n**Judge:** So you’re saying you didn’t accept June rent?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** You told her she didn’t have to pay June rent?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, she didn’t have to pay June rent. She had to find a place to move.\n\n**Judge:** Ms. Harper, did you pay June rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I paid up until the day I left. When I got the notice in July, I paid him July rent. They asked me if I paid the rent, and I said yes.\n\n**Judge:** So you paid him June and July rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Are the new owners coming after you for July rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** What did the property manager say to you? Are they going after him for the July rent?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, they went after him for it.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. DeMarco, did the new owners ask you for July rent?\n\n**Defendant:** No, ma’am.\n\n**Judge:** So is it your position that you didn’t take July rent from her?\n\n**Defendant:** I did not.\n\n**Judge:** How do you pay your rent, Ms. Harper? Cash or some other way?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Money order.\n\n**Judge:** So you have proof?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I have proof of my security deposit and rent payments.\n\n**Judge:** Fabulous. So why aren’t you paying her back her security deposit?\n\n**Defendant:** As I said before, on May 1st, I agreed with her that she didn’t have to pay June rent or any rent as of June 20th.\n\n**Judge:** But you hadn’t sold the place yet.\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n**Judge:** So how would you know to say June 20th?\n\n**Defendant:** I told her in advance that I was selling the property in June.\n\n**Judge:** But you didn’t know it would be June 20th, right?\n\n**Defendant:** No, but—\n\n**Judge:** So how could you possibly say that to her on May 1st?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t know.\n\n**Judge:** How much was your rent, Ms. Harper?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $1,611.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. DeMarco, you collected her rent not once, but twice when you had no right to. Actually, you might have had a right to June rent, but you collected in July as well. Every answer you give me is evasive. You can’t answer directly because you have no defense.

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant stole his roofing tools, but the defendant says he gave the plaintiff a place to live and now the guy’s scamming him. It’s the case of \"It’s a Roof Life.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Welcome. Kevin Mazon, you are suing Tony Wall for $800 that you say he stole from you in cash and tools and refuses to return. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I think it was the morning of October 26. It’s about 7:30 in the morning.\n\nJudge: Mhm.\n\nPlaintiff: I was lying in bed. He came into my apartment.\n\nJudge: Okay, back it up and tell me how you ended up in that bed. How do you two know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: I was a tenant of his.\n\nJudge: Okay. You had struck a deal with him where you would be like the handyman and you would pay a reduced rent, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And what apartment did you move into when you first got there? And were you going to be the handyman and pay reduced rent?\n\nPlaintiff: The upstairs apartment.\n\nJudge: The upstairs apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Interesting, because in your own notes you say that you moved into the upstairs apartment later.\n\nPlaintiff: No, that was the only apartment I moved into.\n\nJudge: Okay. How much rent were you paying or supposed to pay?\n\nPlaintiff: 400.\n\nJudge: 400 or 450? He told me 400. In your notes, you say 450. In your complaint, you say 450. On the landlord statement, he put 450.\n\nJudge: No, no. This is your statement that you signed that is in my hands, and it says the rent was $450. \"I paid a total of $700 when I first moved in for two months.\"\n\nJudge: Okay, well, not if the rent's 450, you didn't. And even if the rent’s 400, you didn’t either. Either way, that doesn’t add up to two months’ rent.\n\nPlaintiff: It was a thing where he needed money. He said just give him what I had and I could move in.\n\nJudge: So let’s move on. So then what happens? You are there from when to when?\n\nPlaintiff: October till December.\n\nJudge: All right. So then on October 26th, there’s banging on your door?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. And who is it?\n\nPlaintiff: Him.\n\nJudge: And what’s he say?\n\nPlaintiff: I had to go.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you said?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I paid rent.\n\nJudge: Right. All right. And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He was moving my stuff physically.\n\nJudge: Right. With someone else’s help?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you call the police, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He came back with the officer, and they told him that he couldn’t do that because, you know, I had to get evicted legally.\n\nJudge: Right. He couldn’t self-help like that. So they made him put all the stuff back?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: I left because I didn’t want to be there with him and his buddy there, because of the way they were talking.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I left while he was there. When I came back, my stuff was back in the house, but as I was going through my stuff, that’s when I noticed my tools and my cash were missing.\n\nJudge: How much cash was missing?\n\nPlaintiff: 500.\n\nJudge: Okay. And what tools were missing?\n\nPlaintiff: Two shingle removers and some roofing jacks.\n\nJudge: Do you have a receipt for those tools?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so did you call the police?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And did you file a police report?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see the police report?\n\n(Plaintiff looks for the report.)\n\nJudge: While you’re looking for that, may I hear from you? What is your response?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor. I was trying to help Kevin from day one. I knew Kevin for about four or five years. He moved to Georgia and came back. The first thing I tried to help him with—I gave him a job. Then, the second thing I did for Kevin—I gave him an apartment.\n\n\nJudge: He was working, why were you helping him so much?\n\nDefendant: Because I knew Kevin, his parents, and a lot of people. You don't see me doing all this stuff for others, so why him? Well, I was helping Kevin because he used to help me when he was here before as a handyman. I used to pay him.\n\nJudge: Okay, so he was constantly helping you?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So when he came back this time, you tried to help him again?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and so I let him move into the downstairs apartment. He wasn’t doing anything he was supposed to. But he knew the people upstairs were getting evicted, so as soon as they left, he moved upstairs.\n\nJudge: What was the difference between the two apartments?\n\nDefendant: The upstairs was a full apartment, a better apartment. He was supposed to stay in the downstairs room and fix it up, which he never did.\n\nJudge: So that morning, you came there and knocked on the door?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I told him, \"Kevin, you have to move back downstairs.\" He refused. So me and another guy started moving his stuff downstairs. He called the police.\n\nJudge: And what happened when the police came?\n\nDefendant: They told me I had to move his stuff back upstairs and evict him the legal way.\n\nJudge: But did you tell them he was renting the downstairs, not the upstairs?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but they didn’t want to hear it. So I moved all his stuff back upstairs.\n\nJudge: Did you take the $500 and the tools?\n\nDefendant: If you saw his room, you’d understand. I can show you pictures.\n\nJudge: Okay, let me see the pictures.\n\nDefendant: This is his bedroom, this is how he was living. You can see the condition of the place.\n\nJudge: (Looking at photos) This is how the room looked?\n\nDefendant: Yes, he lived like an animal.\n\nJudge: After the police made you put the stuff back, what happened next?\n\nDefendant: I went downstairs to work on the downstairs apartment. Three hours later, the police showed up again and said Kevin claimed I pulled a gun on him and stole $1,000 and a ring.\n\nJudge: He said you armed-robbed him?\n\nDefendant: No, he said after the police left, I pulled a gun on him.\n\nJudge: That’s still armed robbery. What did the police do?\n\nDefendant: They asked me about it, but I showed them my gun permit. They didn’t arrest me.\n\nJudge: (Looking at the police report) The police report says $1,000 was missing. Did you tell them that’s how much was taken?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I said my stuff was missing.\n\nJudge: Why would the police write down exactly $1,000 in cash was missing, and nothing about tools?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Did the police ever mention tools to you?\n\nDefendant: No, they only mentioned $1,000 and a ring.\n\nJudge: So where is Kevin now? Is he still living there?\n\nDefendant: No, I had to evict him. He didn’t pay December rent, so I took him to court. He never showed up, so I won the eviction.\n\nJudge: So you’re done with him. Then you get sued for $500 and tools.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: (To Plaintiff) You have no proof you ever had tools or $500 there, or $1,000.\n\nPlaintiff: (Silence)\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the Defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization"}

much\nJudge: So what do you think of [Applause] that\nDefendant: Hey it's it's a madeup letter what was\nJudge: According to you you did pay the other guys\nDefendant: Yes I did\nJudge: And how much did you pay them\nDefendant: I paid them $50 I don't pay him $200 a man okay\nJudge: So if you paid them $50 a man why were you deciding to spend $200 in order for the privilege to be one of the bands that played there that day because you just love performing so much\nDefendant: I I don't I don't pay no one $200 a man\nJudge: I didn't ask that I asked I'm going by what you say which is I paid $50 a man so if you were what so my question to you is if you're not getting paid why are you paying $200 in order to just because you really want to play there\nDefendant: Because I know because my my family does put up put put the show on from from the city you know put put the big picnic on for the city it's a free well\nJudge: Explain explain that to me your family is behind putting the the the picnic on to raise the money\nDefendant: Yes\nJudge: Where does the money go\nDefendant: They don't raise money oh it's a it's a free well picnic it's just for bands to play for nothing I just hire\nJudge: Because you want to play and your family's there and you want a chance to play\nDefendant: Yeah\nJudge: All right now so again why he doesn't get because you just let him he just walked up and started playing the harmonica unbeknown to anybody\nDefendant: I didn't I didn't promise him no money\nJudge: So how did it work out tell me how he ends up playing in a band that you you know\nDefendant: He he he goes to all these dipping jams thinking he can he can be get paid like like just that's a very strange thing to do like he's one of the windshield wipers in in downtown Miami clean your windshield and then go like this I mean that's you know that's a strange thing for musician to do I never spoke to him he never come you know to to even work with us you know cuz we we had a re\nJudge: So here he is suing you cuz he's still mad that he didn't get paid for something he wasn't supposed to get paid for why is he chasing you now\nDefendant: I don't know\nJudge: Maybe it's because he's really angry because you owe him money\nDefendant: I don't owe him money\nJudge: Because this guy says you owe him money\nDefendant: I never promis him\nJudge: I think you ow money the question is how much according to you your friend here doesn't say how much he got paid so how could somebody afford to pay each and every band member 200 he's going to pay $1,000 for the privilege of playing at a picnic that sounds a little high your suit for $200 rather than $50 Mr Shanks here uh was it $50 and you're just mad that it's taken this long so you feel like you should get collection cost too\nPlaintiff: You he gave he gave all of us the Runar around\nJudge: I understand that but was the agree original agreement 50 bucks and then you feel that because you've had to chase him that's worth something\nPlaintiff: Yes because he led me on\nJudge: What was the original agreement was for what for 50 bucks\nPlaintiff: The original agreement was $50 okay\nJudge: I would like to know why it is that in your lawsuit you say under oath that the that he agreed to pay you $200 if the original agreement was for $50\nPlaintiff: Because I had I had to uh go out of my way to receive $50 which no\nJudge: That would be why you're suing for $200 but why you make a false statement is not\nPlaintiff: I'm suing for $200 because of\nJudge: Yeah I understand that but why do you make the statement Michael was to pay me 200 for my performance\nPlaintiff: That's a lie that's for the gas that that that I I burned when I was supposed to meet\nJudge: But you didn't say that what you said was Michael was to pay me $200 for so see he's a jerk because he didn't pay you and I know he was supposed to pay then you're a jerk because you're suing for more than what it is four times what you're entitled to and you're lying about whether that was the original agreement do you understand so I can never have just one right party why is that I just want one one night and shining armor one one person to be totally right and righteous can't can't do it can't seem to find them why can't I do that\nDefendant: I don't think it's you\nJudge: It's not me I think it's happening out there so you're entitled to get paid money and the other person won't pay you and you have to go through the whole hassle of going to court filing in court missing work the whole thing can you legitimately ask for additional money for the hassle time is money and\nPlaintiff: Punitive damages should be award\nJudge: Not punitive damages I'm not talking about where somebody was evil I'm just saying the hassle of all that you have to go through to sue\nPlaintiff: I agree with him okay\nJudge: After I explained\nPlaintiff: No you agree with him what do you think\nDefendant: Yes you need to pay me for my time if I have to go to court and I have to miss work then absolutely you will uh learn a sore bitter lesson here\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom Mr Shanks I believe you were supposed to pay him and you're just trying to keep the money in your pocket I think that you owe him $50 you owe him his court costs in filing this case and you owe him prejudgment statutory interest on the $50 since the day that it was owed back in Memorial Day of 2010 that's my judgment thank you", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Exaggeration ,Deflection ,

{"id": "218", "dialogue": "Judge: Samuel Rodriguez, you are suing Mike Karu and Captain Mike’s Diving Services, hello Captain Mike, represented by Mike, the owner, for $1,773.53—the amount that you paid him for scuba certification classes plus your cost of a trip that you consider wasted because you were not able to dive.\n\nJudge: All right, and you have a counterclaim against him for fraud and defamation. Let me hear from you first.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, this is the line of the week. Every year I go on vacation with my family, and every year I come back more tired than I was before the trip.\n\nJudge: I feel your pain. So tell me about it.\n\nPlaintiff: So, um, May 4, I went to see Mr. Karu, and I told him that I was going to Mexico just to scuba. Even though I was going with my family, I was going to take four days just to scuba dive. Told him how hard I work for this vacation—overtimes and all these things.\n\nJudge: When was this? You went to see him when?\n\nPlaintiff: On, uh, March 4th, sorry.\n\nJudge: March 4th. And when was your trip?\n\nPlaintiff: May 13th.\n\nJudge: Okay, almost two months apart.\n\nPlaintiff: So he told me, \"Okay, so do $450, you take some classes online, and then everything goes well. In two weeks, you have your certification.\"\n\nJudge: Great.\n\nPlaintiff: So I got my online classes—\n\nJudge: So the part that he does—are the online classes free?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no, it’s part of the $450.\n\nJudge: How’s the online part work?\n\nDefendant: I, uh, purchase them from PADI, which is the Professional Association of Diving Instructors—that’s the organization we teach for. I, uh, send the link to him.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you send the link—that’s the only way he can do it, right?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: And that’s part of the $450. And then what do you actually do?\n\nDefendant: You have to take them on two dives in a pool.\n\nJudge: So you take them in a pool—\n\nDefendant: Usually, it’s two-hour sessions, and there’ll be a number of skills that they have to perform before we can take them out in the open water.\n\nJudge: And then they—so it’s two times in a pool and one time in the open water?\n\nDefendant: There’s four dives they will do in the open water, and they’ll do the same skills in the open water as they did in the pool.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what went wrong in this case? You didn’t get to the dives?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I got my two pool sections.\n\nJudge: Good.\n\nPlaintiff: You know, I was very happy. And the last one, I asked him, \"What’s next?\" He said, \"Okay, the open water.\" I asked him when. He said, \"I’ll give you a call.\"\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: After a few calls, we make an appointment for April 28th.\n\nJudge: That’s cutting it close. When was your trip? May 13th, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. I go to the—I take my day off, went to the store, Mike wasn’t there.\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nPlaintiff: Next weekend—\n\nJudge: Wait, wait. You go to the store, Mike’s not there. Do you tell them, \"Get Mike on the phone, I’m supposed to go on a—\"\n\nPlaintiff: I call him in the week, and we make another appointment for the 3rd—next Saturday.\n\nJudge: Wow, you’re very relaxed. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I—I trust him.\n\nJudge: What’s to trust him about? You’re cutting it too close. You’re skipping too much.\n\nJudge: What happened? When did you call him, and when you got him, what did he say about not showing up?\n\nPlaintiff: He said something about hitting his head.\n\nJudge: You—hitting his head? Yes. What happened?\n\nDefendant: No, I—I banged my head March 3rd, prior to his last lesson. So, yes, I was out of the pool for the first two pool sessions. I was present at the pool session, had another instructor do his work with him in a pool.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you fail to appear at your dive shop on the day that he was supposed to do an ocean session? Did he ever schedule the ocean sessions?\n\nDefendant: The open water training dives did not happen because the days he was off and he wanted to go, weather did not permit, and it was not safe to do the dives.\n\nJudge: Okay. How many times did he schedule ocean—the ocean part that weather didn’t permit?\n\nDefendant: Twice.\n\nJudge: Okay. So the last time—\n\nJudge: And both times, were you present?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you said, \"We can’t go out in this weather?\"\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. And was he disappointed?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And how—what were the days that we’re talking about? Do you know the days? Does anybody write anything down?\n\nPlaintiff: The 28th, then the 3rd.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. Went back to the store. Mike wasn’t there. They told me his wife was sick.\n\nJudge: Back to the same thing—phone calls.\n\nPlaintiff: I went to the store.\n\nJudge: So are you telling me that you had ocean dives scheduled, and that you would show up for them, and Mike just wouldn’t show up, wouldn’t call you, wouldn’t cancel?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Do you have any proof of that?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, no.\n\nJudge: Okay, because he runs a dive shop, and I assume you are not the only diver there, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Are there any ocean dives that you just didn’t show up for?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Now, it becomes obvious that before his trip—when was the last ocean dive appointment?\n\nDefendant: Uh, the 3rd.\n\nJudge: What did you do between the 3rd and the—you went to Mexico when?\n\nPlaintiff: The 13th of May.\n\nJudge: Okay, that’s ten more days. You can do an ocean dive. Why didn’t you schedule it?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, when I went back to the store on the 10th, I told him, \"Mike, I’m leaving the 13th. Whatever’s got to happen from today to Saturday can—\"\n\nJudge: And today is what? What day do you call?\n\nPlaintiff: Thursday.\n\nJudge: You tell him on Thursday, \"We need to have two dives between today and Saturday.\" And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s when he pulls out these papers. \"With this, you go to Mexico, and with, uh, this other proof of your classes, you will have no problem.\"\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "framing the narrative, dismissal, persuasion, evasion"}
{"id": "977", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Bob Perry. He says he built a countertop and a stage at the defendant's performance space, and the woman flipped out after the job was completed and refuses to pay him for the materials he purchased for her. He did a great job, gave her free labor, and he's rip-roaring mad that he can't get her to pay him the $800 she owes him. So he's suing her.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Adrien. She says the plaintiff led her to believe he was going to be renting her space, and that's why she allowed him to make some renovations. She let him paint the place black for his biker club meetings. He moved the stage to the other side of the room, and he built a new countertop. Then, the guy did an about-face, told her he wasn't going to rent the space after all, and demanded she pay him. No way! She's accused of billing a biker.\n\n(All parties raise their right hands.)\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff built a countertop and stage at the defendant’s dance performance place and got stiffed. But the defendant says the plaintiff suckered her and made it seem he was renting the space for his biker club meetings. It’s the case of the gnarly Harley deal. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mr. Perry, you were part of a motorcycle club, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Tell me about your motorcycle club.\n\nPlaintiff: We—we’ve been a motorcycle club for 42 years. Uh, I’ve been in the club about that length of time.\n\nJudge: Really?\n\nPlaintiff: So, you know, we’re not young anymore. (Laughs) We ride, we do events, and, uh, we travel.\n\nJudge: Okay. So your club was looking for a place to meet up?\n\nPlaintiff: We were looking for a place to call our clubhouse.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Because we lost our clubhouse about three years ago.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so you find her place?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you don’t own it. You were going to sublet it, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: That was the idea.\n\nJudge: So you two talk, and you like the place?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. But in order to rent the place, you have to have the approval of the whole club?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How’d that work?\n\nPlaintiff: So I spoke to her about sharing space, okay, and we were willing to take three days a week and pay her $1,200 a month.\n\nJudge: And she was fine with it?\n\nPlaintiff: Seemed like it—until the last minute. And then she and her boyfriend told us that we have to pay, uh, by the hour.\n\nJudge: So?\n\nPlaintiff: We didn’t want it.\n\nJudge: But I don’t understand. See, because part of your lawsuit is for improvements you made on the place. Why would you be making improvements before having a lease in place?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no, no. I wasn’t making improvements for my club, so to speak. I was actually making improvements for her.\n\nJudge: Was he making improvements for you?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ask him to make the improvements?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: What improvements did he make?\n\nDefendant: He painted the studio black.\n\nJudge: And what color was the studio before that?\n\nDefendant: White.\n\nJudge: Okay. Why did you let him make improvements before you two had, like, a sublet lease in place?\n\nDefendant: Because we are an art studio. We do have live performances. And if he’s renting for $1,200, which would substantially help out on the rent—\n\nJudge: Except that you didn’t have a lease yet.\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: When you say he’s gonna—he’s gonna—but he didn’t, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So why—I’m just so confused—why you let him make improvements and why you make improvements when apparently it hadn’t been voted on yet and there was no sublet in place?\n\nDefendant: He explained that in order for his club to approve, they would make minor adjustments, and I did feel it would be a bit of a benefit. Not so much the black walls.\n\nJudge: Okay. So black walls and what else?\n\nDefendant: He put in a very large counter. We call it a paint bar because we do a lot of sip-and-paint parties. We have a refrigerator there and a coffee pot.\n\nJudge: Okay. So he put in a counter. And what else did he do?\n\nDefendant: We already had a stage. The stage was actually built last March. He decided he didn’t like the stage and wanted to rebuild it.\n\nJudge: Okay. So if you want to put in your money to rebuild something—\n\nDefendant: Well, he’s now suing me for all that.\n\nJudge: Yes, ma’am. Okay. Did you ever agree with him that if they didn’t rent it, you would pay for these improvements?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say you would pay for the materials for these improvements?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so you are suing her for the materials that you put in for those improvements, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Do you have any proof that she—are you saying she agreed?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. My first, uh, conversation with her was that, uh, I’m—I’m not sure my club members would want to be here, but I can tell you, you do need to improve the place and make it—\n\nJudge: Now, she said, \"Well, go ahead and do whatever you like\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then show me how you sent her immediately, since she’s supposed to pay for it, how you sent her the receipt to get reimbursed.\n\n(Defendant shows text messages.)\n\nJudge: What am I going to see?\n\nDefendant: You’re going to see where he sent me an original text saying his brother died, he hurt his leg, so on and so forth. I said, \"I can help you out. You can throw a party there. You can do whatever.\"\n\nJudge: What—what are we talking about? I thought these guys were just going to rent by the month?\n\n(Conversation continues with Judge asking for proof, and neither party being able to provide it.)\n\nJudge: Okay, really simple. It is insane to go in and make adjustments to a place before you sign the lease.\n\nJudge: My verdict—zero for both parties, with the exception that Mr. Perry is entitled to retrieve his framed wall hangings.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nDefendant: Okay.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, guilt-tripping"}

When he came back—I have a sectional couch—you sleep on one, and I sleep on the other. So I was sleeping, and when I woke up, this man was staring at me.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: So I’m like, \"Okay, something’s wrong.\" So then he says, \"Well, I don’t sleep. I don’t sleep that much.\" So I was like, \"Okay.\" So I got up, I made us something to eat. So he says, \"Well, do you like me? Do I look like my pictures?\" I said, \"You okay, you alright.

The store that we went to first didn’t have it, so then when he arrived at this place, he did park alone.\n\nJudge:\nYes, okay, because he had dropped you guys off in the other pharmacy, and then we... me and my sister proceeded to walk towards Driftway to see if Driftway had the medicine and the soup for my niece and nephew.\n\nJudge:\nSo, let me see if I got this straight: Based on what you're saying, here's what happens: He drops you off at the first pharmacy, then he keeps driving and he goes to the parking lot of where the second pharmacy that you're going to go to is. But these guys don't know that you're going there. The owner of the lot doesn't know that you're going there. And, in fact, what the owner of the lot sees is just this: Him parking the car and walking across the street to H&R Block.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nWe had went to Thriftway right after.\n\nJudge:\nNo, that's what I'm saying: They didn’t see you there. You weren’t in the car. You’re not a guy in the car. We wasn’t in the car. Also, see us, so... uh, do you have a receipt, by the way, from the place that you went to afterwards?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nMy sister has the receipt. I wasn’t...\n\nJudge:\nLet me just ask you a question. Did you... when did you find out the car had been towed?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nMe and my sister had walked back because my uncle was still in H&R Block, and we didn't understand what time did you guys walk back?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nAll I could tell you was nighttime.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you could say it’s like after 6:00? So 7:30, 7:00ish?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nRight, he's still in H&R Block. His car is still there.\n\nJudge:\nI’m not too sure if his car was there.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nYou don’t know?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nNo, it wasn’t.\n\nJudge:\nSo you guys didn’t stick around? You had nothing to do with the car, so the fact that you're at that place buying medicine doesn't mean anything because you're not there when it's parked, and you're not going home in it?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so let me hear from you. You are who?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nI’m Brian Shinen, the defendant.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nIt wasn’t at 10:00 because I’m the one that paid the money.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nIt wasn’t nowhere near 10:00 at night.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nBecause what time did you guys call him?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nDempsey’s timing may be off, but it was around 7:00. They left around... I would say a little after 6:00. It happened maybe 7, 7:15. When I came out, my daughter came up. She said to me that, you know, that they were back but Dempsey had got his car. Something had happened to his car because they were back a couple of minutes. I heard them downstairs. She came up and mentioned that.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nSo when do you place the call? What time do you place the call?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nHe placed... he was on the phone when I came down the steps.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nOkay, so did you grab the phone?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nBy that time, she was... she got off. I let him handle it, and I said to him, \"Let’s hurry up. Let’s go down there because you don’t want to have a problem and have to... storage fees and all that.\"\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nSo you go down there with the 180. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nI went down there with my credit card. He told me he needed cash only, so I ran to a store and came back.\n\nJudge:\nRight. Was it him who was waiting or somebody else?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nI don’t recall. That was my driver. I don’t recall him.\n\nJudge:\nSo he was out there waiting or whatever.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nSo I gave him the money, and then he didn’t want it. He said I need 236. Why did that happen?\n\nJudge:\nSo, so if you park in a mall and then you walk across the street, how quickly can they tow your car?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nI mean, 1 hour.\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\n1 hour?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nReally?\n\nJudge:\nWho says immediately?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nAnybody?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nNo, not me.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nReally?\n\nPlaintiff's companion (James):\nHalf an hour minimum?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nLike, you got a rude awakening coming. Going inside the courtroom. What happened was, when they called for the car after hours, the driver was already home. So, not... they’re not supposed to release the car after hours.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s after hours?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\n5:00, no. After 4:00, an hour after call hours, after 4:00.\n\nJudge:\nSo if it’s towed at 6:00, after hours would be 7:00.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nI need you to not talk. Okay, go ahead.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nOkay, the agreed price that the driver and Mr. Dempsey or the woman... I don't know, I was not there... came up with was 210.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nHow do you know?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nBecause this is what my driver told me the next morning when he first came in and told me this whole ordeal.\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nOkay. He said that she went, and she came back with 180. He did not want to argue with her anymore. She had told my driver how dare he tow a car with a mentally challenged person. And the driver asked, \"How are we supposed to know?\"\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nWhy didn’t you handle this if Mr. Dempsey is mentally challenged?\n\nDefendant (Brian Shinen):\nSo they got into an argument. He did not want to argue anymore, so he took the 180 and said, \"You know what? Forget it.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let me have Mr. Reigns back up. I’m sorry. Okay, Mr. Reigns admits that he parked the car and then he walked to H&R Block. Tell me what they did wrong or what the owner did wrong.\n\nPlaintiff (Dempsey Reigns):\nMy daughter and son went into the Fifth. That’s where they show the car from Thriftway. That’s what the lot is.\n\nJudge:\nI’m sorry. Your daughter and son did not get out of his car at the Thriftway. Your daughter and son, according to your son, had gotten out of the car in another pharmacy going to...\n\nPlaintiff (Dempsey Reigns):\nThat’s great. I might be going somewhere, but unless I was getting out of the car, I don’t have a right to park there.\n\nJudge:\nSo, he parks there and clearly walks across the street, according to his own testimony. And they're not in the car, according to his own testimony. The person who called him and said, \"Hey, tow this car. He parked here and he went there.\" That’s the idea behind these shopping centers is they need to keep that open so they can make money, so they can eat and pay their kids' tuition. They don’t want you parking there taking up their slots for customers to go across the street to H&R Block. They don’t want that, even if it’s for a minute. They don’t want that.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so no. The answer to my question is really a rhetorical question. They did nothing wrong. And my verdict is for the defendant.

{"id": "578", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Kurt Moer. He says he was stopped at a red light with his wife and two kids in the car, and out of nowhere—Boom! The defendant rear-ended him and claimed he dozed off at the wheel. He didn't want to go through insurance, he didn't want to call the cops, and now he doesn't want to pay for the damage he caused. Well, today is judgment day because he's suing him here and now for every penny of the $1,943 he's owed.\n\n**Judge:** This is the defendant, Oomi Atiti. He says he may have dozed off for a minute, took his foot off the brake, and tapped the plaintiff's car with his. The plaintiff's car has a spare tire on the back. There was no scratch, no dent, no damage to the car. The opportunist is just trying to get a payday over a little mishap. He's accused of napping and tapping his way into court.\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please step forward.\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant dozed off at the wheel and rear-ended him, but the defendant says it was a tap and there was no damage. It’s the case of \"Tap That.\"\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Moer, you brought your brother, your brother-in-law, and your son-in-law. Were you in the car too?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He wasn’t in the car. I was in the car. He wasn’t in the car. He owns the car.\n\n**Judge:** Got it. You are suing Oomi Atiti for $1,943 in damages to the rear end of the vehicle. What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It's pretty simple, Your Honor. We were at a stoplight on our way home, and we got rear-ended by Mr. Atiti and his vehicle. After checking and making sure my girls in the back were okay—\n\n**Judge:** How old are they?\n\n**Plaintiff:** They are fine. There were no injuries.\n\n**Judge:** How old were they?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Uh, two and four.\n\n**Judge:** Were they crying?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, no.\n\n**Judge:** So it wasn't a particularly hard hit?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It wasn't a hard hit, no. I had a little neck soreness, but it wasn't anything that made me want to go to the hospital. I didn’t want to escalate it to that. So, we made sure everybody was okay, got out of the car, and I said, \"Oh, you hit my car.\" He said, \"Oh, I’m sorry. I fell asleep momentarily and I apologize. Is everyone okay?\" I said, \"Yeah, everyone’s okay, but let’s pull off to the side.\" And he’s like, \"Well, let's not call the police because I just got insurance. I don’t want my insurance to go up.\" He said, \"I’ll take care of whatever damage is there. I have no problem doing it.\" He was very nice.\n\n**Judge:** Was it a good idea or a bad idea not to call the police?\n\n**Plaintiff:** In hindsight, it was a bad idea.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, that hindsight is where we are, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** Because as it turns out, you have since learned several things: One, he won’t pay for the damage. Two, he didn’t even have insurance according to you.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct. Well, he said he did at the time. I found out later he didn’t.\n\n**Judge:** And you trusted him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. It’s a risk when you don’t call the police that exactly this is going to happen. So what happens? You take a picture of his license?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I took a picture of his license, I took a picture of his car, and a picture of the registration sticker.\n\n**Judge:** Whose car is this?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That’s his.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Is there any damage to his?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah. I can see the bent plate a little bit. I think that’s a bent plate right there. The hood, I think, has a crack.\n\n**Judge:** All right. And then you also took a picture of the damage to your car, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct. The damage actually is underneath. I had two estimates done. There’s a reinforcement bar underneath that was bent.\n\n**Judge:** Mr. Atiti, what happened?\n\n**Defendant:** I did not know actually what happened. All I heard was a bump, you know, on the car.\n\n**Judge:** What happened? You took your foot off the brake? What happened?\n\n**Defendant:** I did not even recollect because I was asleep. We were by the red light, and all I heard was the bump.\n\n**Judge:** Had you fallen asleep?\n\n**Defendant:** I’m not sure. I don’t even know.\n\n**Judge:** Did you tell him you thought you fell asleep?\n\n**Defendant:** Well, I did not. I didn’t know what I said at that time. And as soon as the thing happened, he came down and said, \"What happened?\" I came out too to find out what happened, and I saw that there was really no problem. Whatever.\n\n**Judge:** So did you have insurance when this accident occurred?\n\n**Defendant:** I had insurance. What happened was they were about to terminate my insurance.\n\n**Judge:** So did you have insurance that would cover this?\n\n**Defendant:** I had insurance.\n\n**Judge:** So why didn’t you just have your insurance pay?\n\n**Defendant:** At that time, since we both checked our cars and did not find anything, he was ready to let go.\n\n**Judge:** Then he calls you and tells you he has $1,943 worth of damages. What was your response?\n\n**Defendant:** Less than an hour later, he called and said a shop checked his car and found something was rattling under the trunk. He needed to fix it, and it was going to cost $900. I said, \"What? Now we just left the scene, and there was nothing.\"\n\n**Judge:** All right. I’m ruling in the plaintiff’s favor but not in the amount he is asking for. I’m awarding $500 in damages. That is my judgment.\n\n**Defendant:** I think it’s fair enough. I didn’t really think there was much damage, but he just wanted to get some money.\n\n**Plaintiff:** How do you believe someone that lies about insurance? I came in good faith with proper estimates, and I think she ruled incorrectly.\n\n**Judge:** The judgment stands.

{"id": "432", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nBailiff: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff hired the defendant to provide a DJ for a party, but the DJ got into an accident, and now the defendant refuses to refund her money. The defendant claims the plaintiff canceled at the last minute. It’s the case of Can’t Stop the Music.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Annette Dunlap, you are suing John M., the owner of a DJ company, for $1,500. You claim that you paid $300 for DJ services that were never provided, and you're also seeking additional costs, including bank fees and pain and suffering. Let’s start from the beginning.\n\nPlaintiff's Side\nJudge: Ms. Dunlap, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Annette Dunlap): I hired the DJ company to provide music for my New Year's Eve party. I found them online because they had good reviews and offered a reasonable price compared to others. They quoted me $349, and I paid a $300 deposit in advance.\n\nJudge: Had you used their services before?\n\nPlaintiff: No, this was my first time. I spoke to a woman named Amanda V., who was my primary contact throughout.\n\nJudge: Did you ever speak to the defendant, Mr. John M.?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I only spoke to Amanda V. I was told to contact Mr. M. when I started asking for my refund, but he never responded to my calls.\n\nJudge: What happened the day before the event?\n\nPlaintiff: I received a call from Amanda. She told me that the DJ assigned to my event had been in a car accident and could not make it.\n\nJudge: What solution did they offer?\n\nPlaintiff: Amanda said I had two options:\n\nGet a refund, or\nHire a different DJ through another company, but that would cost $500 instead of $300.\nJudge: Did you ask why you had to pay an extra $200?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I asked why they wouldn't cover the difference, since it was their DJ who couldn’t make it. Amanda didn’t give me a clear answer. At that point, I told her I would take the refund instead.\n\nJudge: Did you get anything in writing about the refund?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I asked for an email confirmation, and she sent one. But it wasn’t from Amanda—it was from someone named Roxanne Simonetti.\n\nJudge: Who is Roxanne Simonetti?\n\nDefendant's Side\nDefendant (John M.): She’s a secretary at my company.\n\nJudge: Mr. M., can you explain why Ms. Dunlap was told the DJ was in a car accident?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know anything about that.\n\nJudge: You don’t? Because I have an email here, sent from your secretary, which clearly states, \"The DJ that was scheduled to do your event was unfortunately in an accident and won't be able to attend.\" Did your secretary make that up?\n\nDefendant: I have no idea why she would say that.\n\nJudge: So you're saying there was no car accident?\n\nDefendant: No, not that I know of.\n\nJudge: Then why did your secretary lie to your customer?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: That’s interesting because you originally claimed that the plaintiff canceled on you.\n\nDefendant: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: So which is it? Did she cancel, or did your DJ back out because of a supposed accident?\n\nDefendant: She canceled.\n\nJudge: So if she canceled, why would your secretary send an email saying your DJ was in an accident?\n\n(Pause. The defendant appears visibly nervous.)\n\nDefendant: I don’t have an answer for that.\n\nJudge's Analysis\nJudge: Here’s what I think happened: You overbooked yourself for New Year’s Eve. You had multiple events going on, and you didn’t have enough DJs. When you realized that you couldn’t fulfill all the contracts, you started choosing which clients to keep—probably the ones who were paying the most. Then, rather than being honest, you lied to Ms. Dunlap and tried to push the extra cost onto her by suggesting a $500 alternative.\n\nDefendant: That’s not true.\n\nJudge: It is true, and you know how I know? Because if Ms. Dunlap had canceled on you, there would be no need to mention a car accident at all! The fact that your secretary sent that email proves that you canceled on her.\n\n(The defendant remains silent.)\n\nPlaintiff’s Additional Costs\nJudge: Ms. Dunlap, you’re also suing for $400 in bank fees and $500 in pain and suffering. Explain.\n\nPlaintiff: I had to make multiple bank transfers and cover extra fees while trying to sort this out.\n\nJudge: What about the pain and suffering?\n\nPlaintiff: I went through a lot of stress trying to find a last-minute replacement. My boyfriend helped me find someone, but I had to negotiate, and it was a hassle.\n\nJudge: How much did you pay for the replacement DJ?\n\nPlaintiff: Another $300.\n\nJudge: So, in reality, you’re only out $300, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, yes, but I also had to—\n\nJudge: I understand it was stressful, but pain and suffering is not something I typically award in small claims court for a business contract issue.\n\nFinal Verdict\nJudge: Here’s what I’m going to do. I am ordering the defendant to refund the original $300 deposit. You don’t get an additional $300 because that would mean you get a free DJ. Your bank fees are not directly tied to the defendant’s actions, so I will not award those. Pain and suffering is also denied.\n\nMy judgment is for the plaintiff in the amount of $300.\n\nClosing Remarks\n(Gavel bangs.)\n\nBailiff: The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff for $300. Court is adjourned.\n\n(Outside the courtroom, the plaintiff smiles while the defendant shakes his head.)\n\nPlaintiff: I’m happy I at least got my money back. They should have just been honest from the beginning.\n\nDefendant: I still don’t think I did anything wrong. It’s just business.\n\nBailiff: That’s it for The People’s Court.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, persuasion"}

{"id": "685", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff is a big-time car collector and says the defendant is holding his whips hostage. But the defendant says the plaintiff hasn’t paid for storage in eight months. It’s the case of no cash, no carry.\n\nJudge: Dennis DeFranco?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, good morning.\n\nJudge: You are suing Dominic Laiso?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: For $5,000, the amount you say you’re out is actually $15,000 for cars of yours that you've stored with him that he refuses to release to you. You have a counterclaim against him for $3,800 for storage charges that you say he hasn't paid. What's going on?\n\nPlaintiff: I was desperate for storage. I needed a place to store my cars. A friend of mine told me—\n\nJudge: How many cars?\n\nPlaintiff: It was 14 total at the initial time.\n\nJudge: And why were you desperate for storage?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I had a shop in Long Island, but I was moving to North Carolina, so I needed to find a place to store them. I had a transport scheduled. When I met with this gentleman, we worked out an arrangement for storage.\n\nJudge: The arrangement?\n\nPlaintiff: I believe it was $200 a month for 14 cars as long as 14 cars remained. I had the 14 cars there. I got a transporter to get them—the first run came through.\n\nJudge: What kind of cars are we talking about?\n\nPlaintiff: Two 1967 big-block Camaros SSs, I think five IROC-Z Camaros, a Daytona 500 Pace Car Trans Am, two special edition GTA Trans Ams, and two Mustangs. Not all cars were in good shape. Some were rough, some were in good shape, and two were just recently painted.\n\nJudge: Okay. I have all the photos of the cars before they went to his shop and at his shop. So the agreement is you bring him the cars—when?\n\nPlaintiff: I brought the cars to him in August, I believe towards the end of August or September.\n\nJudge: Of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: Last year, ma’am. I’m sorry—August 2011.\n\nJudge: And then you’re supposed to pay him $200 a month. When you dropped the cars off, did you pay the $200?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him $400 down—$200 for the first month and $200 security as we agreed.\n\nJudge: Is there any argument about that? Did you get that?\n\nDefendant: No, ma’am. Complete opposite.\n\nJudge: How much did he give you?\n\nDefendant: The deal started in July. He only gave me $200 and didn’t pay me a dime thereafter.\n\nJudge: Do you have a receipt?\n\nPlaintiff: He refused to give me any paperwork.\n\nJudge: Then why did you give him cash?\n\nPlaintiff: I was desperate for storage at the time.\n\nJudge: Why would he refuse to give you any paper? Why not write down on a piece of paper, “I, hereby acknowledge receiving $400,” and then you’d have a receipt?\n\nPlaintiff: There’s no written agreement whatsoever.\n\nJudge: Even worse. I'll get to that in a second. But you're paying him cash and you have no way to prove how much you paid?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: That’s crazy, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your honor.\n\nJudge: So now you don’t have actual paperwork about the storage to begin with?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: And according to you, it happens in August. According to him, it happens in July. So then what happens? You arrange for transport for the majority of the cars?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I moved nine the first time. About a month and a half, two months later, I came back to New York, spoke with Dominic—\n\nJudge: But even by your math, a month and a half, two months later, you're already owing more storage fees and you're not paying.\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him the money when I picked up the second batch.\n\nJudge: But you're behind on storage fees, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but we had—\n\nJudge: How much behind were you?\n\nPlaintiff: One month.\n\nJudge: So now you owe another two months?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because when they took the first nine cars, we renegotiated our deal. There were no longer 14 cars, only five.\n\nJudge: And what did you renegotiate it to?\n\nPlaintiff: $100 a month.\n\nJudge: Is there a dispute about that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am. It was $400 a month.\n\nJudge: According to you, the charges are $400 a month?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And you have nothing in writing?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: I hate flapping gums. I’m setting the storage fees at $300 a month as an appropriate value. I’m deducting from that the amount he agrees that he got. You don’t have proof of having paid him more. That leaves us with $2,800. By the way, you said July, and then in your lawsuit and counterclaim, you said August, not July. So just a moment—tell the truth there.\n\nJudge: That makes the verdict for the defendant on the storage fees—$2,500. Upon payment of that, you are releasing those cars. You have to have a place to take them. I’m going to give you two weeks of free storage. After two weeks, if you haven’t picked them up, you’ll have a problem because under New York law, he will take your stuff if you don’t pay.

That week was good for me at work, so I felt I could afford to help her.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI’m an auto mechanic for the Post Office.\n\nJudge:\nWas she working at the time?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI assumed she was. I think she was working, but I wasn’t 100% sure.\n\nJudge:\nWere you two close?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNot really. I had moved to Florida about eight months prior, and we had just reconnected. We grew up together about 30 years ago in Michigan, but we hadn’t seen each other in a long time.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI thought about it overnight, then called her the next day and told her I’d help. When she asked me, she said, \"I'm getting my tax return back in a few weeks. I get about $10,000 back a year, so it’ll only be a temporary loan.\"\n\nSince she said she’d pay me back in a few weeks, I agreed.\n\nThat Friday, I got paid and gave her some cash. I also took out a small loan from my retirement account to cover the rest. That’s where the $50 withdrawal fee came in.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have proof of the $50 fee?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, Your Honor. I brought it with me.\n\nJudge:\nHow much did you take out in total?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$2,100.\n\nJudge (to Defendant):\nDo you dispute that he gave you $2,100?\n\nDefendant (Chris):\nNo, that’s correct.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI gave her the money and waited.\n\nApril ended. No tax return.\n\nMay came. Still nothing.\n\nI started texting her:\n\"Hey cuz, what's going on?\"\n\nNo response.\n\nI left messages and texts—still no reply.\n\nEventually, she texted me back saying: \"What do you mean? I thought that was a gift. We’re family.\"\n\nI told her, \"No, Chrissy. I had to take a loan out to help you.\"\n\n[Defendant's Statement]\nJudge (to Defendant):\nAlright, Chris. Let’s hear from you.\n\nDefendant (Chris):\nI’ve been struggling. My husband passed away six years ago, and I’ve had a tough time financially.\n\nJudge:\nI’m sorry to hear that.\n\nDefendant:\nThank you.\n\nI didn’t ask for the money just because—I really needed it for my rent.\n\nJudge:\nHow much was your rent?\n\nDefendant:\n$1,100.\n\nJudge:\nWhere do you live?\n\nDefendant:\nPinellas, Florida.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Were you working at the time?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, I worked two jobs, but it still wasn’t enough.\n\nSo, I asked Henry if he could help me.\n\nJudge:\nDid he ever tell you that you didn’t have to pay him back?\n\nDefendant:\nHe never said it explicitly, but I assumed because we’re family. We do things for family.\n\n[Courtroom Debate]\nJudge:\nWelcome back to The People's Court.\n\nIs it a good or bad idea to loan money to family?\n\nCourtroom Spectator #1:\nBad idea. If they don’t pay you back, it can ruin the relationship.\n\nCourtroom Spectator #2:\nIt can cause conflict, but you want to help family when they need it.\n\nCourtroom Spectator #1:\nIf they make it rich, they’ll pay you back. If not, you’re a sucker.\n\n[Final Ruling]\nJudge (to Defendant):\nHave you ever loaned anyone in your family $2,000 before?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nIf you did, would you expect them to pay you back?\n\nDefendant:\nIt depends on the situation. I probably wouldn’t expect it.\n\nJudge:\nReally? But you never loaned that much before.\n\nHere’s the problem—this isn’t $20. If it were, I could understand someone saying, \"It’s family. Are you really suing me for $20?\"\n\nBut $2,100?\n\nDid you know he had to take money out of his 401(k)?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, he mentioned it.\n\nJudge:\nSo, it’s not like he just had the money lying around. He had to go through a process to get it for you.\n\nAnd you’re telling me that you thought you didn’t have to pay it back?\n\nI don’t buy it.\n\nIt sounds like you just don’t want to pay your bills. You were on the eviction process before, and now you're doing the same thing to your cousin.\n\nDefendant:\nBut—\n\nJudge:\nNo \"but.\"\n\nNow, your whole family knows.\n\nHow’s the family reacting?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI kept it quiet because I didn’t want to embarrass her.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I hate to break it to you, but you're on national television right now.\n\nSo, I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff for $2,100, plus prejudgment statutory interest in the State of Florida.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting, framing the narrative, emotional appeal, evasion"}

{"id": "738", "dialogue": "\"Judge:\nOkay, John and Laura Narowski. Yes, you are suing the moving company. You've asked to not mention the company by name and to call you Eugene by your first name and we'll respect that, for $5,000, the value of items that you say have been damaged by them in the move and that they refused to pay you. Tell me what happened.\nPlaintiff (John):\nUm, I hired the moving company in May to do two moves at the same time. We just bought a house in Georgia and so I had to move my stuff down to Georgia. My wife was staying in New York for a little while longer because she was having work done on her teeth and all that and it wasn't finished, so we had to get her an apartment so she can move there. So, that was around the corner, less than a quarter mile from where we lived.\nThey sent in on May 30th, I think it was 12, 13 guys moving stuff all over the place. It was hectic, chaotic. They finally got... I don't know too many moves that are calm while you're drinking, yeah, people running all over the house, packing boxes, moving stuff, asking questions.\nJudge:\nOkay, wait, wait. So they were packing you too? Were you packing both at the same time?\nPlaintiff (John):\nI really didn’t want that, but they were... I’ve always found that to be such a luxury. What are you charged to pack somebody?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nIt depends. It goes by the carton. We give an estimate of how many cartons they want us to pack, and based on how many cartons they want to pack, it goes by a carton.\nJudge:\nBut you literally take every single item in their house and box it?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nYes.\nJudge:\nI’m not too much of a control freak. I could just never let that kind of mode of control. Where then you're trying to figure out where everything is later and if it made it there... I just can't do it.\nJudge:\nAll right, so anyway, go ahead.\nPlaintiff (John):\nSo anyway, they did the move. They moved her to the apartment right around the corner, and the first thing they noticed was they broke a pedestal that was my mother’s. They recognized that on the... a broken pedestal?\nPlaintiff (John):\nYeah, that was noted quickly on the sheet from the...\nJudge:\nOkay, so it’s made out of what?\nPlaintiff (John):\nPlaster, I guess it was.\nJudge:\nOkay, all right. It's, I take it, you don't have a receipt or anything for it?\nPlaintiff (John):\nNo, that was my mother’s.\nJudge:\nOkay, so go on.\nPlaintiff (John):\nDuring the move, they put a rip in the back of the love seat.\nJudge:\nWhen did you purchase that love seat?\nPlaintiff (John):\nAbout six years ago.\nJudge:\nDo you have a receipt for the love seat?\nPlaintiff (John):\nNo, I don’t.\nJudge:\nHow much did you pay for the love seat?\nPlaintiff (John):\nWe paid a little over $3,000 for this love seat couch.\nJudge:\nSo how is it you’re suing for $2,000 for this? It can’t be replaced?\nPlaintiff (John):\nI went to an upholsterer in Georgia, right, and he says you can't replace it. You can barely fix it. He can fix it but...\nJudge:\nWhy can't you reupholster the couch?\nPlaintiff (John):\nThey can’t get the material.\nJudge:\nNo, that was the same material, with a different material. Then it wouldn't match anything.\nJudge:\nRight, because it has other stuff that... Okay.\nPlaintiff (John):\nI have a picture of the couch. Is this where you have the couch?\nPlaintiff (John):\nYeah, this is the couch. The couch is against the wall.\nPlaintiff (John):\nYep, the couch is against the wall. The love seat was blocking the living room-dining room area, and we had to switch that around now because of the tear. We have to put it in front of a window, which we really didn’t want to do.\nJudge:\nSo you paid $3,000 for this couch and this love seat, and you’re suing for $2,000 to replace the love seat?\nPlaintiff (John):\nYeah, it can't be replaced. Even the repair’s not going to replace all of it.\nJudge:\nAll right, so go on.\nPlaintiff (John):\nThey lost... Well, during... There's three more things in your lawsuit. One of them is a scratched coffee table. Can I see the... and are you noticing, is this in Georgia or in the apartment?\nPlaintiff (John):\nThis is in the apartment.\nJudge:\nHow did things go in Georgia?\nPlaintiff (John):\nWe don’t know yet. We know... We had some damage. I had an adjuster... well, I’m going to step back...\nPlaintiff (John):\nYou don’t have anything from Georgia in this lawsuit?\nPlaintiff (John):\nNope.\nJudge:\nBecause you’re suing in Georgia?\nPlaintiff (John):\nYes.\nJudge:\nDo they know that?\nPlaintiff (John):\nYes.\nPlaintiff (John):\nNot until now.\nJudge:\nAll right. Now, you don’t deny... do you deny that...\nDefendant (Eugene):\nNo.\nJudge:\nNo. The question is not of liability but of damages because you believe that they’re inflating this.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nThat’s correct. I had an adjuster look at the pictures and he wanted to go to the home, and when we called, they said Mrs. Narowski said she was moving again and she didn’t have time for him to come over.\nJudge:\nWhy wouldn’t he... you have time for him to come over?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nSo the love seat and the couch cost $3,000 new. Now they’re used. They’re used items, and the plaintiffs want $2,000 for the love seat. Is that greedy?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nThat is extremely greedy. You can’t expect $2,000 for a used couch, repair... use love seat.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nEven if you’re just... what’s it worth? I mean, what’s a used love seat?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nWhen the whole thing was $3,000 new, at least a third, I would think.\nJudge:\nMaybe $1,500 at most?\nDefendant (Eugene):\nYeah, but that’s almost like giving him the cost of a new love seat.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nYeah, just a couple hundred for repairs, probably.\nJudge:\nOkay, fair enough. Going inside the courtroom.\nPlaintiff (John):\nI told him I was moving, but he would have to come before the date I was moving to.\nJudge:\nWhen were you moving?\nPlaintiff (John):\nI moved to Georgia in... no, no. How long after that phone conversation were you moving?\nPlaintiff (John):\nThe last... go ahead.\nPlaintiff (John):\nThe last call I got from Mr. M was July.\nJudge:\nI’m not asking about a call you got. I’m asking about your wife.\nPlaintiff (John):\nI get a call from him.\nJudge:\nWait, who did you talk to, her or...\nPlaintiff (John):\nHe came to my apartment.\nPlaintiff (John):\nHer in person or on the phone?\nPlaintiff (John):\nOn the phone.\nPlaintiff (John):\nNo, after I came through, I went to her apartment to take pictures of the items. And after I left her house, I went over to the adjuster to have him take a look at the items to get a cost estimate.\nJudge:\nBottom line is your adjuster was never able to go and see them in person, but he was able to look at pictures. But in any event, why wasn’t your insurance company more speedy?\nPlaintiff (John):\nThey have up to 90 days to settle a claim, and it does say that. It says it right on the bottom of the form, it says 90 days.\nJudge:\nSo why didn’t you wait the 90 days?\nPlaintiff (John):\nBecause I got four different stories from him on how we’re going to do the claim. First, they were going to come to the house, to my apartment, and fix it. Then it was, we’re going to send somebody there to pick it up, to send it out. Then it was, we’re going to send an adjuster...\nJudge:\nShow me the wood wall plaque that you say is missing.\nPlaintiff (John):\nNot missing, it was... I’m sorry, that you say is damaged.\nJudge:\nI’ve seen the pictures of the coffee table. I’ve seen the pictures of the sofa and the pedestal. There was also after the fact... after this thing... It’s a pedestal?\nPlaintiff (John):\nIt hangs on the wall.\nJudge:\nIt's Spanish behind it. You’ll see the whole picture. Okay, with all due respect, both the coffee table and this wood... has a solution. A repair is a solution.\nJudge:\nOkay, I think that the... the pedestal, I don’t know that it has a solution. I don’t know how much it’s worth. But the sofa is probably the biggest problem.\nJudge:\nWhat’s this a picture of?\nPlaintiff (John):\nIt’s a portable air conditioner vent.\nPlaintiff (John):\nMy wife noticed later on after we filed the...\nJudge:\nI want you to use it.\nPlaintiff (John):\nThere are four missing coats. I don’t know where they are.\nJudge:\nDidn’t go to Georgia because when I moved, they packed some of the stuff that was in the closet. When I unpacked my stuff in New York, there’s no inventory of the stuff that got packed?\nPlaintiff (John):\nJust the stuff that went to Georgia.\nPlaintiff (John):\nThere's an inventory, there’s no inventory for the Yonkers stuff.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nNo, because it’s not what we call an “on and off.” We loaded it in the morning and delivered it in the afternoon. So everything that was loaded in the morning, went in the truck and unloaded.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nSo if it went on the truck, it went off the truck. We didn’t just stop on the side of the road and sell stuff.\nPlaintiff (John):\nYeah, but sometimes movers lose things.\nDefendant (Eugene):\nI don’t know.\nJudge:\nThis is going to be one of those cases where I do what?\nJudge:\nDouglas looks like some really rough justice, really rough justice.\nJudge:\nWhich is for me to look at the damage and assess what I believe the damage is worth. I believe the damage is worth $1,000, and I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,000.

She started just acting, you know, just outrageous with me.\n\nJudge:\nHow so?\n\nDefendant:\nJust like questioning me, and I'm like, \"Look, I don't want nothing serious. I just want, you know, I'll go out.\" We only saw each other like once a month. She lived an hour and 20 minutes away from me, so it wasn’t like a serious relationship, and I stated that from the beginning that I didn’t want nothing serious.\n\nJudge:\nSo you only saw her once a month?\n\nDefendant:\nAbout, yeah.\n\nJudge:\nIs that accurate?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nHow often did you see him?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAt least three times a month. He would have to come and get me, and I would stay there from anywhere from three to four to five days.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. When you say once a month, do you mean five days worth in that one time, or—\n\nDefendant:\nNo, maybe like a weekend out of the month. I would pick her up from the house she was renting a room at, and I’d bring her to my house. And then, uh, when we got done hanging out for the night or the day, I would return her back to where she was. And it was an hour and a half away.\n\nJudge:\nAbout an hour and 20 minutes.

Because I won’t give him $800 for nothing.\n\nJudge:\nSo you were loaning him $800, and he was supposed to pay you back $1,800?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nIs that accurate?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, it’s not, your honor.\n\nJudge:\nSo how long once you start dating somebody before you loan them money?\n\nDefendant:\nA year for me. I mean, I have to know the person, minimum a year to a year and a half, then I'm like, we’ll talk, and it depends on what it’s for.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so it does depend on what it’s for?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nShe never loaned you any money?\n\nDefendant:\nNever. I never asked her for money.\n\nJudge:\nAccording to her, she loaned you $800. She texted you many times about \"Give me my money.\"\n\nDefendant:\nYes, and I ignored all her texts.

{"id": "294", "dialogue": "Judge: Yes, you are suing Jerry Key for $1,500 in pain and suffering because his dog attacked you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Um, I was doing my daily walk. I have a beagle, and I usually walk him morning, afternoon, and night. My gosh, can you go to my place?\n\nJudge: Morning, afternoon, and night?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I walk him like about 8:00 in the morning. Then I'll walk him in the afternoon, and then I do his last walk in the evening.\n\nJudge: Okay, that's not for Rex, it's actually because the dog you live in an apartment so you're getting the dog out of the apartment for him to do his business.\n\nPlaintiff: Just to do what he has to do. And then in between times, I'll let him in the backyard. I guess this was like in the afternoon. I was taking him for an afternoon walk, and we usually go toward the green. But now you can’t go on the green because nobody's cleaning up the poop. So, we walk around the green. You have to walk them on the sidewalk. It’s a nice little walk, you know, for him. We were walking around in a circle and were heading back home. There was a young lady outside, I guess somewhere on the porch, and she yelled, “Stray dog is coming.” So, I grabbed my dog, Arrow.\n\nJudge: Arrow?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, his name is Arrow. I grabbed Arrow, and I picked him up because I didn’t know what was going to happen, where the dog was at, or what it was going to do. So, I picked him up. As soon as I picked him up, a little white poodle came across the street and just charged after us, and just started attacking me. The police were out there, but he was on the corner in the car. I’m trying to move and dodging this way, dodging that way, saying, “Get off of me! Get away! Get away!” The dog was trying to bite me, so Arrow jumped. The dog jumped, you know, how dogs usually come up on your leg when you pet them?\n\nJudge: Well, they shouldn’t, but yes...\n\nPlaintiff: Right, but he jumped up on my leg and bit me. I guess he was trying to get to Arrow because Arrow was in my arm, but he couldn’t get to Arrow, so he bit me. The police saw the whole situation.\n\nJudge: Where did he bite you?\n\nPlaintiff: Above my knee.\n\nJudge: Okay, so the police must have seen us in the street going back and forth, like, “Get away, get away.” So the police got out of the car, came toward the scene, grabbed the dog, and the dog tried to bite him. He didn’t bite him, but he went to snap at him, and the police, I guess, contained him. The police followed him all the way to the house. After the dog did the incident, he went home. The police followed him to the house, and I guess once the dog was in the yard, the police got him in. They came back out, and I couldn't really see where the police were going. So, I flagged the cop down, and I said, “Officer, officer!” He came down the street, and I said, “He bit me.” He asked me if I wanted him to call the ambulance. I said I couldn’t get in the ambulance because I had my dog, and I needed to bring my dog home first. He said, “Can I see the bite mark?” I showed him the puncture wound. He said, “Once you bring your dog home, go to the emergency room.” I said, “Yes, that's what I'm going to do because I don’t know if the dog had rabies or not.”\n\nJudge: Did the police officer give you the address of the house?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because I went to the emergency room. I didn’t talk to him, but the police called the emergency room and made sure I got there. I went to the emergency room, and they cleaned the wound out. They gave me—well, the first day they gave me four shots.\n\nJudge: Wait, did the police officer make contact with them to find out whether the dog had its shots?\n\nPlaintiff: I think he spoke to someone.\n\nJudge: You don’t know?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I got the police report, and when he spoke to me, actually, I didn’t speak with the police because the dog pound in our town was closed for some reason. I don’t know why they took the dog to the dog pound.\n\nJudge: No, no, the dog pound from the other town called me and asked me if the dog had its shots. I told them he was unlicensed.\n\nJudge: Wait, why did the dog pound call you about the shots?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Okay, Animal Control calls you about the shots and asks whether or not the dog has had its shots, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you show proof of the shot, or could you not find the paper?\n\nPlaintiff: I couldn’t find the paper, so that’s why I had to get the shots.\n\nJudge: Thanks to you not having the piece of paper to show, you ended up with how many rabies shots?\n\nPlaintiff: Seven shots.\n\nJudge: Have you ever had a rabies shot?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand what you're saying.\n\nJudge: Have you ever had a rabies shot?\n\nPlaintiff: Absolutely not, but I have heard it’s terrible.\n\nJudge: How many shots did you have to get?\n\nPlaintiff: When I went to the emergency room, they gave me four shots where the puncture wound was at. I had to get a tetanus shot in one arm, a tetanus shot in the other. I had to go back a week later for another shot, then three days later for another shot, then another week for another shot, then I had to do a follow-up, and they gave me antibiotics for it. I have the police report and the hospital records.\n\nJudge: Show me the pictures.\n\nDefendant: What happened? I left my back door open. I’m sorry.\n\nDefendant: I really apologize, because I’ve been bitten, and I know how that is. My dog is not a vicious dog. Maybe in the excitement, when she had her dog in her arm, he likes to play. If he bit her, I don’t know if she was kicking at him to tell him to get away or what. But he’s not going to run up to you and attack you.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Harvey Levin here. So, we get so many of these... What percentage of dog owners do you think are irresponsible and shouldn’t own dogs?\n\nSpeaker 1: I’d say around maybe 43%, 40-ish.\n\nJudge: Why so high?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because people are irresponsible.\n\nSpeaker 2: I’d put it pretty low, maybe 15%.\n\nSpeaker 3: A quarter. About 25%.\n\nJudge: Okay, fair point. You’re going to be in the middle here.\n\nJudge: I think about a quarter of people are irresponsible with their dogs. I’m going with you. That sounds about right to me.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom. Your dog gets out because you’re an irresponsible dog owner who didn’t lock the gate. The dog ends up biting somebody. She ends up having 437 shots. That’s her knee all swollen up. And your defense is, “Nah, that’s a nice dog. My dog wouldn’t do that.” That’s your defense?\n\nDefendant: Did you were you there when the officers came and knocked on the door that day?\n\nDefendant: No, I was at work.\n\nJudge: Was someone else there?\n\nDefendant: My neighbors.\n\nJudge: Your neighbors saw the officers and the officers talked to the neighbors?\n\nDefendant: I assume that.\n\nJudge: How did you find out that the officers had been there, that your dog had gotten out?\n\nDefendant: When I got there, they said the police were looking for me. So, I called the Derby police department, and they told me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I was bitten by a dog about five years ago, brutally attacked by a dog.\n\nDefendant: Was it a stray?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant: Had the dog gotten out of somebody's yard?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, the dog had gotten out of someone’s yard.\n\nJudge: There’s no offense. That’s what makes it really odd that you would leave your back gate open. You know what the consequences could be. Be honest. I had no idea I did it. I was rushing that day. I have a business downstairs. I lock that door, and I'm rushing off to work. I don’t use the door in the back because it stays locked, but the key broke off inside the lock. I don’t lock it from the outside. Blah, blah, blah.\n\nJudge: And the dog ate my homework? All the people that should be careful are the ones who understand what they’re doing to another human being, a guy who’s actually gone through it.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nDefendant: Not only does she have to go through the pain of getting bitten, she has to go through the pain of the injections.\n\nJudge: Was that worse than getting bitten?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it was.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it was. It was worse.\n\nDefendant: I had to walk there.\n\nPlaintiff: You had to walk? Why don’t you have transportation?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t have transportation.\n\nPlaintiff: How far was the hospital?\n\nDefendant: A mile and a half.\n\nJudge: I live 5 minutes from the hospital. You can actually see it. You got the wrong attitude for a guy whose dog got out and caused this much damage.\n\nDefendant: Lock your door!\n\nJudge: Lock your door and pay the lady $1,500.

{"id": "970", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Okay, Mr. McDermot, you are suing Tropical Reef Incorporated for $4231.18 in expenses that you incurred on a tank that you ordered from them that you say has been defective all along. Tell me what's going on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Basically, I tried to surprise my wife with a new aquarium for her birthday.\n\n**Judge:** You had an old aquarium, and that aquarium was what kind of aquarium?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was a 180-gallon bow front aquarium.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. By bow front, it means it comes out like that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. All right. So you decide on a new aquarium for her birthday. Her birthday is the end of May. The aquarium does not come in the end of May, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** All right. What exactly did you order? Do you have the paperwork from what you ordered?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The only thing I've seen is an email that says 180-gallon bow front.\n\n**Judge:** Right. Is there something more than that with more specifics—height, size, width? Because you can have 180 gallons like this or you can have 180 gallons like this. 180 gallons is volume, not measurements. So is there anything other than this which I’ve seen?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was written on a torn-up piece of notebook paper. I asked them to email me everything that we discussed and he said he would send it to me, and that's what I received in my email.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, but this doesn’t have dimensions, right? All right. Did you draw out on a piece of paper any dimensions?\n\n**Defendant:** There was no need to.\n\n**Judge:** Why not?\n\n**Defendant:** Because he wanted a 180-gallon bow front, and I happened to have one right in the shop.\n\n**Judge:** So he said, \"I would like that tank there.\"\n\n**Defendant:** We made that tank there, so the dimensions came off—\n\n**Judge:** You had seen one at the shop and you said you wanted that one that looked like that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, ma’am. I saw that one and I told him I had one at my house already and it was taller than that one. And when we were negotiating, I told him I was looking to upgrade. I have 180—\n\n**Judge:** So let me see if I got this straight. You’re in the shop. You see one. You say, \"I’d like one like that.\" He goes, \"I’ll make you one like that.\" You say, \"I’d like one like that but taller.\" It’s very important that it be taller because yours is taller, and so it’s all about the height. And then that’s what’s not in the paperwork, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Correct.\n\n**Judge:** Well, that's ridiculous on both your parts, not just one of your parts. So you order the tank. You get this that says nothing other than that it's 180 gallons. And what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I received an email stating that the tank was ready.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And how long later was that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Eleven weeks.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so it's past her birthday?\n\n**Plaintiff:** May 22nd.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, it’s before her birthday. Okay, just before her birthday. And then what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Contacted the cabinet maker.\n\n**Judge:** The only thing I’m sure about in this case is your wife’s birthday. Okay, go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Contacted the cabinet maker because they had to wait for this to be done in order to make sure everything blends perfectly in the building of the cabinet.\n\n**Judge:** Everything’s custom. The tank was custom. The stand had to be made custom. So everything was built around this tank. Uh-huh. So what happens? You get the tank, and what’s the problem?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s too short by the time I got it home.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And what do you mean \"too short by the time you got it home\"? Did it shrink? What do you mean by that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s too short compared to my old tank.\n\n**Judge:** Right. So it’s just—it’s not as high as you’d like it to be. It’s not as tall as you expected?\n\n**Plaintiff:** 29 inches high versus 24 inches high.\n\n**Judge:** Right. So that’s your problem with it. Let me see the pictures.\n\n[Continued discussion of measurements, gallons, and leaking tank.]\n\n**Judge:** I have one guarantee in my invoice, and that’s that I bought a 180-gallon tank. I’ve got only one party measuring how much water fits in the tank, and it’s not close to 170. At the end of the day, he has the one thing that you didn’t do—180 gallons. And it’s not. Well, industry standards can say it’s lower, okay? Industry standards can say it’s 170. It’s not 170 either. So even if I go by what you’re saying, it’s still woefully too small for what we’ve got. So no, this is on you and not on him. On his claim against you, I am finding in his favor in the amount of the $4231.18.\n\n**Judge:** So the plaintiff prevails.

{"id": "913", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff agreed to rent an apartment with her disabled son, but then the defendant said she couldn't move in with the son, and now he won't return her security deposit. The defendant says the plaintiff's the one who changed her mind. It’s the case of ‘Don’t Be Cruel.’\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Francia Aosta, you are suing Martin Kagi for $1,765 in a security deposit plus a bounced check fee because he never let you move into the apartment, according to you. You say she changed her mind. Let me hear from you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: This is the way it started. I was living at 20 Madison, and I had to move from there because they had to sell the house. So at the end of my lease, I told the landlord that I needed to look fast for an apartment. I started looking and found in the Penny Saver this gentleman. They were fixing the apartment. I gave him $1,000 and asked for a receipt, and this is what he gave me.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Right away, I sent a letter to my Section 8 housing office informing them that I wasn’t going to stay there and that I had found a place in Ridge. This is the paper proving that.\n\nJudge: Okay, but did he know that you were on Section 8?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you know that she was on Section 8?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: So you were working with Section 8 to do the inspection or whatever else would have been necessary?\n\nDefendant: That is correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: So I gave him $1,000, and later in the process, I gave him $700. When I met him for the first time, I told him that I had a disabled son who is bipolar and very sick.\n\nJudge: On medication?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he is.\n\nJudge: How old is your son?\n\nPlaintiff: He’s 24 now.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: He agreed that it wouldn’t be a problem for my son and me to move in. After they did all the paperwork, the inspection had to be done in the place, and the inspection didn’t pass. I have proof of that.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Then it took like two months for paperwork.\n\nJudge: How many months from the time that you wanted to move in to the time everything happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a while.\n\nJudge: That wasn’t my question. How many months?\n\nPlaintiff: From March to June.\n\nJudge: What happened in April?\n\nPlaintiff: The process continued.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: A second inspection was done, and it passed.\n\nJudge: When was that?\n\nPlaintiff: Probably in June.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: After the inspection passed, he started asking about my son. He asked if I thought it was a good idea for my son to move in because he’s bipolar. He questioned me about my son’s condition. I told him the truth, that when my son is low on medication, he can get angry, but he is a sweet and clean person. Then he told me he was going to talk to ‘the commission.’\n\nJudge: What commission?\n\nPlaintiff: The board of directors at the condos.\n\nJudge: Did your son have a history of violence?\n\nDefendant: She told me he was locked up once or twice, put holes in walls, and we were really concerned.\n\nJudge: When did you learn that?\n\nDefendant: After about two months.\n\nJudge: But why did you continue for four months?\n\nDefendant: Because I liked her. I thought she would make a great tenant.\n\nJudge: So what changed?\n\nDefendant: The violence concerns.\n\nJudge: If you changed your mind, why not return her money?\n\nDefendant: I returned $1,500 of it but stopped after that.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant: She wanted to take me to court over $250, so I told her to take me for the whole amount.\n\nJudge: So she’s suing you for $1,765 plus a $15 stop-payment fee.\n\nJudge: Can a landlord deny someone based on disability?\n\nDefendant: I don’t think it’s right, but they can.\n\nJudge: Actually, they cannot. That’s against the law. Verdict for the plaintiff, $1,765.\n\nDefendant: I thought returning $1,500 was fair.\n\nJudge: But you were the one who changed your mind, not her. Pay the full amount.\n\nCourt Officer: Case closed.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": " defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting , Deflection ,Evasion"}

Come to order, please.\n\nJudge: Maryann Gambella?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing Yolette Cherubin Hy for $5,000 in personal injury that you say you have undergone as a result of her negligence in maintaining a sidewalk?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, um, it was actually last August, August 12th. It happened to be my birthday. I was out for dessert with my husband, my son, and his girlfriend in the next town from where I live. And after we had dessert, I decided that I wanted to walk home to burn off the calories from dessert.\n\nJudge: So alone?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: On your birthday? You couldn't get any of these guys to walk back with you?\n\nPlaintiff: I can't believe I wanted to walk then.\n\nJudge: I know.

I could see that it was rough. As I walked over it, my foot twisted, and then I started to fall, but my right foot caught into a piece of concrete, and I went down.\n\nI was knocked unconscious, and the next thing I knew, there was a young man standing over me saying, \"Lady, lady, you all right?\" You know, it's so funny because when my foot caught, it was like everything went in slow motion. I knew I was going down. I knew it was going to happen. But I didn't realize that I had actually passed out.\n\nSo there was this young fellow—I guess he was coming home from work. He said, \"Don't worry, I called the police. I called an ambulance.\"\n\nJudge: Come on up, husband. How much time had passed when you got that phone call? Were you already expecting her?\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: Maybe only about 15 minutes.\n\nJudge: All right, so you get the phone call from him, and he says your wife had a fall?\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: Right. He said, \"Well, there's been an accident.\" I said to him, \"Is she okay?\" He said, \"Oh yeah, yeah. She was unconscious, but she looks like she slipped on the sidewalk. There's police here now, and the ambulance will be here any minute.\" And I was there in like five minutes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what were your injuries? You ended up having to have dental surgery?\n\nPlaintiff: So when I got to the hospital, I knew that I cut my forehead open. They told me they would have to put in stitches, internally and externally. It came to about 35 stitches.\n\nJudge: 35 stitches? Wow.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. And then my husband said to me, \"Do you know that you chipped three teeth?\" The minute I heard that, I said, \"It's one thing when I have 35 interior and exterior stitches on my head, but chipping my teeth? No, I can't go out looking like that.\"\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I paid a fortune for these teeth—they're all veneers. So I was like—\n\nJudge: So you had to go in for dental surgery?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I did. I went to the dentist a few days later, and it was $3,000 to repair those three teeth—$1,000 a tooth.\n\nI also thought that I had broken my leg, so they x-rayed my leg. They said it wasn’t broken but recommended that I go to an orthopedic doctor, which I did later. Then he sent me to physical therapy. It just became a whole fiasco.\n\nJudge: What do you do for a living?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, I’m a retired RN.\n\nJudge: Then why are you suing for $1,800 for lost wages?\n\nPlaintiff: After I retired, I had opened up a small delivery service company, and I'm paid as I work.\n\nJudge: Do you have any proof that you would have made $200 per day and that you lost nine days?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I have my tax return—\n\nJudge: What she does have is—hold on.\n\nPlaintiff’s Husband: The company she works for as an independent contractor wrote a letter saying she didn't show up.\n\nJudge: Let me have that. Let me talk to you. When did you first learn that all this had happened?\n\nDefendant: The house is a rental. A two-family rental.\n\nJudge: Do you own it?\n\nDefendant: I own the house, but I don’t live there.\n\nJudge: Right. So you rent it out?\n\nDefendant: The tenant moved out. It was when people were cleaning the house for me after the renters moved out that they found letters. A lawyer had sent me letters, and in one of them, it actually stated that she broke her hip.\n\nJudge: Did you break your hip?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Why is your lawyer sending letters saying you broke your hip?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.

The next case on the docket: the plaintiff says the defendant’s German Shepherd attacked her Viszla badly in a dog park. The defendant says it was just a scratch, so chill. It's the case of German attack. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Anna Chernovich, you are suing Roy Bamford, correct, for $2180.89 in vet bills that you say resulted from his dog. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: On December 23rd, at three o’clock in the afternoon, my daughter and I took the dog to the dog park.\n\nJudge: What kind of dog do you have?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s a Viszla. It’s a hunting dog.\n\nJudge: What does that look like? Do you have a picture?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. You can just give her all of them. There’s a headshot somewhere in there.\n\nJudge: So go on.\n\nPlaintiff: We approached the orchard, which is a dog area where dogs are allowed off-leash. There were two dogs and two individuals present. My dog recognized one of the dogs and started to run over.\n\nJudge: Is that the defendant’s dog?\n\nPlaintiff: No. His dog, Bentley, approached. Our dog had played with Bentley maybe two or three times in the past.\n\nJudge: And his dog played well with your dog before?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, so I was not concerned when I arrived at the dog park. There are usually a lot of dogs there. Bentley, however, approached my dog, growled, and my dog ran away. His dog proceeded to follow and within 10 seconds bit my dog. There was no fight. My dog did not cry out. I just noticed that out of the corner of my eye, something was wrong. He was running over to me, and he had this big gash on his side.\n\nJudge: So you could see the gash?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh yeah.\n\nJudge: And your dog didn’t yelp or anything?\n\nPlaintiff: I think it was out of shock. The skin was sort of like a triangular laceration and was sticking up. He started to just lick it immediately.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures of the wound?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What did you do next?\n\nPlaintiff: Right away, I was like, “Oh my God, this is a bad situation. We need to get him to the vet immediately.”\n\nJudge: Well, like a thinking person would think that too, you know.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, so I went into Mommy Mode. Mr. Bamford and the other gentleman took a look at the dog, and I said, “Oh my God, I have to go right to the vet.” Mr. Bamford said, “It’s nothing but a tooth snag.”\n\nJudge: What happened at the dog park, Mr. Bamford?\n\nDefendant: I was at the dog park for maybe 15-20 minutes. Her dog entered from the side, started to run with them, changed course, and they collided. I turned around and saw a white spot on the dog. The dog has no hair, so in the collision, the tooth must have gone in, but it wasn’t a bite.\n\nJudge: Did she see your dog bite her dog?\n\nDefendant: No, she didn’t.\n\nJudge: Did her dog yelp?\n\nDefendant: There was no growling or barking. They were running, playing like they always do, and all of a sudden, we heard a yelp. They both split up, and I saw the white mark. I walked over, and two gentlemen were there. When she left, I asked if she wanted my phone number.\n\nJudge: Why would you offer your phone number if it was just a collision?\n\nDefendant: Because I’m a dog person, and I felt obligated.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what ended up happening with the dog?\n\nPlaintiff: We took him to the vet. He had surgery that afternoon. They cleaned the wound, stitched it up, and put a drain in. The next morning, he was feverish. My daughter would sit with him, cuddle with him, and put blankets on him.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: By December 26th, he had to go back. The vet suspected an infection. It turned out he contracted streptococcus in his wound.\n\nJudge: What did they do then?\n\nPlaintiff: They gave him a different dose of antibiotics.\n\nJudge: And did he recover?\n\nPlaintiff: He developed three sacs of fluids. He had to be brought back constantly. Eventually, he leaned against furniture, knocking over a speaker and breaking his toe.\n\nJudge: And you’re suing him for that because…?\n\nPlaintiff: Because if he hadn’t been in pain from the bite, he wouldn’t have leaned against the furniture.\n\nJudge: And if you had secured the speaker, he also wouldn’t have had a broken foot.\n\nDefendant: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Mr. Bamford, did you ever offer to pay anything?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I sent a check for $1,000. She refused it.\n\nJudge: In your state, there’s a strict liability rule. If your dog causes damage, you’re responsible. However, the broken toe is too attenuated.

How much is this condo?\r\n\r\nDefendant: It’s pretty steep. I like to live nice. And so I pay 5,000 a month.\r\n\r\nJudge: See, you know what? You obviously came here to waste my time.\r\n\r\nDefendant: No, no, I didn’t really, I didn’t.\r\n\r\nJudge: Is this three-year-old in daycare?\r\n\r\nJudge: What, how much is daycare?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: A daycare runs about 300 a week. He’s autistic, so he has special needs and counseling.\r\n\r\nJudge: Counseling. Does mom show up to any of those doctor’s visits or anything?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Well, no, of course, I haven’t always told her, but—\r\n\r\nDefendant: They haven’t expected I would come.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, you haven’t given him any money either.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Now, I don’t have anything against my former daughter-in-law. I mean, she was married to my son, but I do need a little more involvement and a little help.\r\n\r\nJudge: I agree with you. Definitely, if she’s spending 5,000 a month to own a condo—\r\n\r\nDefendant: I don’t even stay in the condo, ma’am. I need that. I have to have that. I need that. I have to have that.\r\n\r\nJudge: So we’re going to go ahead and make that happen today. And the child has been living with you for the past two years, you say?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Two years.\r\n\r\nJudge: In Texas, we’re only allowed to take 9% of her gross. So based on 9%, the child support will be 262.50.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I can’t afford that.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, sell your condo, then maybe you can afford it.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Will that start—can you give me maybe three months before that starts so I can re-budget my bills?\r\n\r\nJudge: Um, no.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I had a question. Why are you being so hard on me?\r\n\r\nJudge: Ma’am, I’m not being hard on you. You have not given this man any type of child support to support your child. And then you come to court and say you don’t have money, but you travel.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I just don’t have it.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, I can’t help you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: Now, your back child support comes out to 394.56. You have to pay that back from the time that the child has lived with Mr. Schaefer.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Wow, that’s not fair.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yes, ma’am. In Texas, it goes back four years. Your child is three. So with that calculation, it comes out to 14,204 dollars and 16 cents to be paid monthly at an amount of 200. That makes your total child support obligation.\r\n\r\nWell, I’m going to make it 300 because 14,000 is a huge amount. So that makes your monthly child support obligation 694.56.\r\n\r\nDefendant: I got some receipts that I can show you. I just can’t afford them.\r\n\r\nJudge: And you know what? He has bills that he can show me as well, and you have not done anything.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection, Playing the victim, Minimization, Gaslighting"}

But the defendant says it was a 1999 Cougar and in fine shape. It's the case of the Cougar that...\n\nJudge: Thank you. You're welcome. Carolyn Gardner Hodnik, you are suing Jeffrey. You've asked us not to use your last name. You're actually suing his company. You're the owner?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I am.\n\nJudge: Okay. You purchased the car for $2,414.50 that you want returned to you, and the purchase price of the car plus repairs that you put into it because, according to you, you bought a lemon. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. On February 5th, my husband and I went to his business to pay for the car. He actually made provisions for us on a Sunday, usually not open on a Sunday.\n\nJudge: Prior to this, had you ever done business with him before?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. In the past, my husband bought a car from him a few years ago, and the car was perfect. That's how we knew of him. So it's not like we just went to some stranger or anything like that. So we did do business with him in the past. So nonetheless, we went there on the 5th, we paid for the car.\n\nJudge: What kind of car?\n\nPlaintiff: A 1999 Cougar.\n\nJudge: And how much did you pay?\n\nPlaintiff: It was $2,000.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: When we went to start the car, the car did not start.\n\nJudge: At the dealership?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. So he was like, \"Well, I'll have my mechanic look at it and everything like that.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So the next day he calls me and tells me that it needs a new starter. But he didn't make any money off the car when the guy traded the car in and that I would have to pay for half of the starter. Never produced a receipt or anything. Told me it was $175.\n\nJudge: Why didn't you just walk away?\n\nPlaintiff: He told me there were no refunds.\n\nJudge: How could there not be a refund when the car won't even come off the lot?\n\nPlaintiff: I can't answer that.\n\nJudge: Why would you put up with such an answer?\n\nPlaintiff: I have things here saying how many times I've called him, and he said it's written on my receipt.\n\nJudge: Why would there not be a refund on a car that hasn't even—you can't even deliver it, you can't even call.\n\nDefendant: There would have been a refund if she didn’t want the car. I would have gladly given her money back.\n\nJudge: So do you tell them that \"I have to put in a new starter, it's going to cost X, do you want to back out, what do you want to do?\" What is it you say to them?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn't ask her if she wanted to back out because she didn't say she wanted to back out. She wanted the car.\n\nJudge: So when you say to them, \"I put in a new starter, and guess what, you owe me half,\" what do they say?\n\nDefendant: I told her it was costing $400 to repair the starter. I told her I sold the car to her at cost and if she wouldn’t mind paying 50% of it.\n\nJudge: And she said?\n\nDefendant: And she said, \"Okay, she will do it.\"\n\nJudge: Did she ever say to you, \"No, I guess I just want my money back\"?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say to him, \"Forget it, I don’t want to go through with the deal\"?\n\nPlaintiff: I said to him, \"What are my other options?\"\n\nJudge: That’s not what your complaint says, though. Are you trying to make the case better now?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Okay. So go on from there. You decide you're going to pay half the cost of the starter, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I picked up the car Monday the 6th from the auto mechanic. We drove it. On the 7th, the 8th, on Thursday, the check engine lights come on. I called him and I said, \"The check engine lights are coming on, there’s a grinding sound when I start the car.\" He’s like, \"Okay, you know there’s a one-year warranty on the starter, bring it to me if there are any problems.\"\n\nJudge: And did you bring it back?\n\nPlaintiff: I parked the car in my driveway Friday. I go to start the car, and the car does not start at all. I call him, leave a message at 10:00 at night expecting to get a phone call back from him the following day. It’s 1:00 in the afternoon, no phone call, nothing. I call him. \"Jeff, the car won’t start.\" And he’s like, \"Well, what’s wrong with it?\" I said, \"I’m not a mechanic.\" He’s like, \"Well, what do you mean it won’t start?\" I said, \"Exactly, it does not start.\"\n\nJudge: Did you have it towed back?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, on the 13th.\n\nJudge: And what happened next?\n\nDefendant: I had a mechanic look at it, checked everything, and the car was fine. I returned it to her house.\n\nJudge: Did you tell her you were dropping it off?\n\nPlaintiff: No. He left my keys in my mailbox.\n\nJudge: Did you hear back from her after that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, she left a note listing new complaints about the car.\n\nJudge: And?\n\nDefendant: The transmission slipping, a rumbling sound, check engine light. I checked, added antifreeze, drove it up the block, no issues.\n\nJudge: The state law requires certain warranties for used cars, but with over 100,000 miles, only safety at the time of sale is required. Did you have any additional warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Then your claim for a refund doesn’t hold. You assumed risks with an old car.

{"id": "279", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you. Doug John and Joseph Hayes, yes, you are suing Benjamin Genta for $2,935, the cost of a motorcycle that you want to return to him because you say that it is defective, pain, and suffering, mileage, tolls, and mechanic’s fees. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Correct. My son purchased a motorcycle from Mr. Genta. Mr. Genta gave him on two occasions in writing a 30-day warranty.\n\nJudge: How old is your son?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): 21.\n\nJudge: How many times did you look at the bike before you bought it?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Twice, I believe.\n\nJudge: Did you test drive it?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): No, he wouldn’t allow me to.\n\nJudge: Did you have a mechanic look at it?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): No.\n\nJudge: How many bikes have you owned?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): This was my first.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): My son and his girlfriend were there, went and looked at the motorcycle, and he gave Mr. Genta a $50 deposit. When it was time to pick it up, I went with him.\n\nJudge: You did go with him. Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): When he arrived home that evening, he had said to me that Mr. Genta had given him a 30-day warranty in writing, which I gave to the court as evidence.\n\nJudge: Let me see the original.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): The original is the handwritten one. That’s what I want.\n\nJudge: Okay, thank you.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): 30-day guarantee on all non-wear and tear items.\n\nJudge: Was that something he just offered up or something you demanded?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): It wasn’t a demand. He swore by his work and his bikes, and his words. I said, “Would you be willing to put it in writing?” and he said, “Absolutely, no problem.” And in front of myself and my girlfriend, he took out a pad and a pen, asked for my driver’s license, and wrote it up right there. That’s why I had him sign it.\n\nJudge: So, he signed both?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): A little less than 200 miles on the motorcycle, my son had a problem with it starting.\n\nJudge: How long after the purchase?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): About 10 or 12 days.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): I instructed him to call Mr. Genta and let him know.\n\nJudge: And what was the problem?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): At the time, I had no idea. It just wouldn’t start. It wouldn’t even turn over.\n\nJudge: How was it manifesting itself?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): It turned over but it wouldn’t start at all. It just continued to crank and crank and crank, to the degree where I put the battery charger on it to make sure it wasn’t a battery issue.\n\nJudge: And what did Mr. Genta tell you?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Mr. Genta instructed him to bring it to him. When I spoke to him, I asked what was going on. Mr. Genta demanded $300 for the repair.\n\nJudge: So, let me get this straight, you had the bike for how long before you had the issue?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): 10 to 12 days.\n\nJudge: And Mr. Genta demanded $300 to take a look at it?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, continue.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): I spoke with Mr. Genta myself, and I asked him why he was demanding the $300. He said, “You can’t expect me to check it out for nothing.” I said, “I sort of can, if there’s a warranty.”\n\nJudge: And what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): I told him that standard practice with any motor vehicle is that if it’s under warranty, you bring it in for a diagnosis to see if the issue is covered.\n\nJudge: So, what did Mr. Genta say?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Mr. Genta said he wouldn’t look at it without the $300.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you have a diagnosis from another mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Yes, from a reputable shop. It cost $149 for them to diagnose the bike, and it took about an hour and 20 minutes to identify all the issues.\n\nJudge: So, you’re asking for that diagnostic cost and the price of the bike?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Correct.\n\nJudge: What else are you claiming?\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): Mileage, tolls, and other costs for repairs.\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): When I gave him the bike, it was in perfect working condition. He was just learning how to ride, and I suspect he may have damaged it.\n\nJudge: Wait, stop. Are you saying the bike was fine when it left your shop?\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): Yes, it was.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you gave him a warranty on the bike?\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): Yes, but I don’t usually warranty vintage bikes.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): He gave us a guarantee, not a warranty.\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): Right, it’s a guarantee. But I don’t normally guarantee vintage bikes.\n\nJudge: So why did you give him a guarantee on this bike if you don’t do that?\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): Because I wanted to reassure him. But I don’t usually do that for vintage bikes.\n\nPlaintiff (John Hayes): He promised to repair it under the guarantee.\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): Well, I didn’t agree to give a warranty.\n\nJudge: The issue is whether the warranty or guarantee was honored. If it wasn’t, you breached the contract.\n\nDefendant (Benjamin Genta): I didn’t breach anything. The bike was fine when I sold it.\n\nJudge: I’ve reviewed the evidence and testimony. The bike was sold with a guarantee that was not honored when it failed. The mechanic diagnosed the issue, and you refused to honor the guarantee. I’m granting the plaintiff’s claim for the cost of the motorcycle, diagnostics, and reasonable expenses.\n\nJudge: The verdict is in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,653.

And what was it you were looking for?\n\nPlaintiff: I was looking for a certification that would help me start my fitness career.\n\nJudge: Okay, so they had a program where if you paid a certain amount of money and taught a certain amount of classes in order to pay down that money, then in the end, you would be certified? Are they the certifying entity? How does that work? Is there like a national association of something?\n\nDefendant (McFerson): Our studio is affiliated with Yoga Alliance. It’s a nonprofit that sets the standards for yoga teachers, but not all yoga studios have to abide by or subscribe to them. We do voluntarily. We certify the teacher, and if she chooses to register with them, then she could teach anywhere they’re recognized.\n\nJudge: So hold on one second. Have you given out certifications to people before her? Is she the first person you ever handled?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. How many have you given out before her?\n\nDefendant: Gosh, I don’t know. I want to say at least up to 100.\n\nJudge: And there’s never been a problem?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So, Nina, what exactly is the program that you bought into?\n\nPlaintiff: I started with bar training and then...\n\nJudge: Bar is separate from yoga, yes?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: B-A-R-R-E, bar class, right? I’ve done them. I just know that I can barely walk out afterward. Tiny movements, you don’t even look like you’re doing anything, and you’re dying.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you were going to get certified for both bar and yoga?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what was that going to cost you?\n\nPlaintiff: Together, the bar training was $1,250, and the yoga training was $3,200.\n\nJudge: And now explain to me the part about where you have to pay if you don’t teach.\n\nPlaintiff: In the contract, it states that we can work off the hours. Instead of having to pay $1,250 plus $3,200, I could work at $16 an hour to cover the costs.\n\nJudge: Or pay?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you specifically chose that program because it was a work-study program?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then you started having problems when you got a full-time job elsewhere?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What was the full-time job?\n\nPlaintiff: Teaching bar and other fitness classes.\n\nJudge: And how were you qualified to teach those if you still weren’t done getting certified?\n\nDefendant: She completed the training for both yoga and bar.\n\nJudge: So then, what was she still working towards?\n\nDefendant: She was working to pay off the fees. She didn’t pay out of pocket. If she had, she would have gotten her certification and been on her way.\n\nJudge: And then what went wrong?\n\nDefendant: From the very beginning, she started flip-flopping. I have emails to prove it. First, she said she wanted to work two days a week.\n\nJudge: Were the two days approved?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I said okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And then I got that full-time job. At first, I was paying them off. I told her I would pay for all Thursdays of the month.\n\nJudge: Did she agree to that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she did.\n\nJudge: And that’s in the contract as an option?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I heard she had sued five people for not finishing out their contracts.\n\nJudge: So you decided not to finish yours?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I heard one of them proved in court that it wasn’t in accordance with Yoga Alliance standards.\n\nJudge: Are you prepared to prove that now?\n\nPlaintiff: I am.\n\nJudge: How?\n\nPlaintiff: The teachers who trained us had just graduated before we started. Under Yoga Alliance standards, they weren’t qualified to teach us.\n\nJudge: Show me the proof.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over resumes.)\n\nJudge: Where does it say they aren’t qualified?\n\nPlaintiff: Under Yoga Alliance standards, trainers must have 500 hours of experience or two years of relevant experience.\n\nJudge: And your proof that they didn’t have that?\n\nPlaintiff: Their resumes.\n\nJudge: Let me see.\n\n(Examines resumes.)\n\nJudge: It says here one of them interned elsewhere before coming to you.\n\nDefendant: Yes, that counts toward experience.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof they weren’t qualified?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have specific proof.\n\nJudge: That’s a problem.\n\nJudge: You claim she sued other students.\n\nDefendant: I sued two students, not five.\n\nJudge: And what happened?\n\nDefendant: One didn’t have a contract, so I lost.

Okay, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Yes, how you doing, Yan?\n\nJudge: Good, how are you?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Okay. On May the 16th, I hired Mr. McCoy to come and lay some new sod down on my yard because my grass had weeds in it and it was looking a little bad, so I figured I’d get a whole new grass done, you know, have it dug up and had Mr. McCoy lay some new sod. The way I was referred to Mr. McCoy, one of my neighbors down the street had him do the same thing, and I liked the way it looked. So he gave me Mr. McCoy's phone number, and I called him. I gave him a down payment. Two days later, he came and dug up my old grass. The next day, he laid the new sod, and then I finished paying him.\n\nJudge: Then I guess it looked good?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Yes, it looked good.\n\nJudge: All right.

So that’s what I did. I watered it every day. The rain helped; it rained a couple of days within that week.\n\nJudge: Okay. He came back. Mr. McCoy came back. He said he laid some fertilizer down, he cut the grass. A few days later, my grass started browning. I called him back and said, \"Mr. McCoy, you got to come back over here, my grass is brown.\" He comes over and he sees what's going on, and he started coming up with a lot of different excuses. \"My kids played in the grass, ran on the grass.\" Did you water?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Yes, I did water it. I told him. Then he said he was going to take a sample of my grass. He thought I got a leak underground that's messing my grass up. He was going to take some of my grass and get a sample test done.\n\nJudge: I said, okay. He comes back about a couple weeks later. It gets worse. This is where my pictures start.

He’s ignoring my calls, he’s not returning my calls. So now I decided I’m going to have to take him to court.\n\nJudge: Okay. I have a question. Is this your house too, like that's part of your house, or is that the neighbor’s house?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Let me see. See what I mean? There, all your house or is this someone else’s?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): No, this is the neighbor. I didn’t get to this part. This neighbor down the street, grass died that he did.\n\nJudge: Wait, next door to you?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): No, about four houses down.\n\nJudge: Oh, whose... Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are those... Did you hand me everything you handed me were pictures of your house?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): No.\n\nJudge: Oh, for the love of God, when were you going to tell me that?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): I got it on the back.\n\nJudge: Okay, I’m sorry. That’s the neighbor whose grass you had seen and said, \"Ooh, that looks good. I want me some of that before his died.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): Okay, before his died. Okay.\n\nJudge: Is the neighbor suing him too?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): No, the neighbor, after the neighbor's grass died, he figured he better fix it. He fixed it. I got a picture in there.\n\nJudge: Wait, to fix the neighbor’s?\n\nPlaintiff (Anthony Reel): But not mine. Not mine.\n\nJudge: I think they’re friends. I’m not sure. I don’t know why, but I have a picture... What’s going on?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): Good morning, Judge. This is what’s actually happening. Mr. Reel contacted me. I work in an area. I’ve got 72 houses that I basically maintain their area alone. He approached me, telling me something about he had a contractor do some popcorn ceiling in his house. He said the yard was contaminated from the popcorn ceiling chemicals.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): I told you what I can do. I tore it up, treated the soil, fertilized the soil. How do you treat the soil?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): With lime and liquid fertilizer, and that should take care of the chemicals from the popcorn ceiling.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): Well, that’s what we were trying to do, you know, use lime. Lime usually kills or neutralizes any chemical contaminants, usually.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): I did exactly what Mr. Reel asked me. Now, the first 7 to 10 days, you must not water it, saturate sod, not just water it but saturate it. Did you tell him that?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): I explained that to him and every other client.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): What he did, if you look clearly at stuff, it’s drying out. It’s not exactly dying; it’s drying out. If you look very closely, it’s drying out.\n\nJudge: How do you dry out when you water grass? If you were grass, how would you dry out?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): I can’t. It dries out if you don’t water it properly, it will dry out. New sod.\n\nJudge: Are there other things besides not watering it properly that could cause this sod to turn this way? For example, when he says that you said to him, maybe the chemicals from the popcorn ceiling... I’m going to get your sod tested. Did you ever test the sod?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): I never told him that. I don’t know where he got that from. I didn’t test it.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say to him that you would take it somewhere to be tested?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): No.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): Not at all.\n\nJudge: Did the neighbor’s yard also go bad?\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): His yard? What actually happened is it separated after it settled, and the grass died. He called me back, he said, “Listen, can you just come redo the hill?” I said, “No problem. I’ll redo the whole yard as long as you pay for the sod.” He paid me for the sod. I went back down, redid the whole yard at my expense. I didn’t charge him any further labor. I didn’t charge him anything else but the sod.\n\nDefendant (Monty McCoy): Now, I have pictures. His yard has been growing for weeks now, no issues. Now, the soil on the sod has dried completely out. When I walked across it, I got issues.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection, Minimization, Playing the victim, Gaslighting"}
{"id": "681", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff was hired as a mystery shopper by the defendant and says he got stiffed, but the defendant says he scammed, he didn’t shop where he said. It’s the case of \"shop till you sue.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Ronald Kerer, you are suing the company that you were working for, represented here by Julia Gwyn. How do I pronounce the last name?\n\nDefendant: Gwyn.\n\nJudge: Gwyn. You've asked us not to mention the name of the company or its clients, and we'll respect that. You are suing them for $1,293 that you say they owe you in reimbursements for the job that you performed. Now tell me, I’m fascinated by this case. Tell me the job that you perform.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, Your Honor, this is a situation in which I was employed as a mystery shopper.\n\nJudge: Mystery shopper?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: And your job description is?\n\nPlaintiff: To visit the business and perform multiple duties. In the case of a supermarket, you have to evaluate the deli counter, the cleanliness of the supermarket, and the produce aisle. In the case of a fast-food restaurant, you have to time the amount of time it takes from when you get to the order line to when you place your order, to when you receive your order, to when you pay your order in nanoseconds. You have to use a digital timer. In a clothing boutique, you have to go in there acting nonchalant like you’re looking to buy a gift and hope they present non-sale merchandise and make recommendations, and then you make a purchase.\n\nJudge: Okay. Who hires you? You work for them, and you get hired by the chains?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Right. Because they’re trying to see how the franchises are operating or how their own employees are operating. It’s like \"Undercover Boss\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly right.\n\nJudge: How long have you been doing this?\n\nPlaintiff: I did it for the company for about three or four months.\n\nJudge: You’ve never been a mystery shopper before this?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: All right. So what happened here?\n\nPlaintiff: In this particular situation, the criteria from the mystery shopping company is overwhelming, and they are critical when it comes to reporting. In the event that there is a miscalculation or a mistake in the report, or if the procedure isn’t followed, then the mystery shopping company denies payment. So now you’re out your time, you’re out the visit where you should have been paid, you’re out the money you paid for the visit, and you’re also out your expenses, your tolls, and your gas.\n\nJudge: Now is that what happened in this case?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s what happened.\n\nJudge: Okay. Do you have a list of the work that you did that, according to you, was not reimbursed?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. May I see it?\n\nJudge: All right. What happened here?\n\nDefendant: So we have 600,000 mystery shoppers across the United States. We consider them independent contractors. As part of the application process, they do sign an independent contractor agreement, which I have here. Paragraph five states that they are not entitled to any reimbursements except for those that are set forth in the job posting. What we have is a website that has a bunch of available jobs that the mystery shoppers will take a look at. They’ll see what’s in their area, they’ll see what amount they’re going to get paid for the actual shop, and if there are any reimbursements. Sometimes the fast-food restaurants or even some of the restaurants will just give up to $20 for you to go do a mystery shop at their location, plus you may also get a fee for doing that as well.\n\nJudge: Meaning you can have lunch and get a fee?\n\nDefendant: Right. You might get—the fees are pretty minimal, like $10, $7, depending on the job. But if, like, you were going to go to the burger joint anyway and get a burger, and you were going to go shopping at this big retail chain and buy stuff, you also get the stuff you buy, right?\n\nJudge: Exactly. This is fascinating. It’s a great business model. But hold on one moment. Okay, so I have a list of the jobs that you say you were not paid for. According to this list, there are 24 different jobs, and you’re suing for the visit, the item that was purchased there, and gas and tolls. What is your defense to what he’s saying?\n\nDefendant: We were only able to match three visits out of the 24 to our records, and all three were canceled by Mr. Kerer. In some cases, he claimed he performed work for a client we don’t even have. There are also issues where he submitted visits that seem impossible, such as being in four different locations just a minute apart.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying he falsified records?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and one of our clients is considering prosecution for attempting to return an item he never purchased from their store.\n\nJudge: Mr. Kerer, did anyone tell you that you were being removed from stores due to your behavior?\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor. This is the first I’m hearing of it.\n\nJudge: Your claims are inconsistent and don’t add up. You have a bank listed that isn’t even one of their clients, exaggerated expenses, and job IDs that don’t match.

{"id": "329", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please step forward.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff bought a car from the defendant and claims he knew it was a lemon, but the defendant says the plaintiff checked the car out, so tough luck. It’s the case of \"Ain’t No Lemonade Here.\" Thank you. Douglas, okay. Ms. Zigler, you are suing Jose Medina for $4,000 that you say he owes you for knowingly selling you a lemon. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: So this all happened within a five-day span. I’m a college student. I withdrew from my savings to buy a car. I was looking on Craigslist, where I came across his ad, which I have a picture of. In his ad, it says it runs and drives great, which I came to find out that it doesn’t.\n\nJudge: When did you meet up with him?\n\nPlaintiff: On a Monday. The check engine light was on, so he’s like, \"Let’s bring it to AutoZone down the street.\"\n\nJudge: Wait. When you're test-driving the car, the check engine light goes on?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you just look for another car?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, because I was told that the check engine light can go on for multiple reasons.\n\nJudge: Why would you take the risk? Is this your first car that you’re buying?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Who was the gentleman with you?\n\nPlaintiff: My boyfriend.\n\nJudge: Was he with you when you test drove the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: All right. I mean, you know, there are lots of cars for sale. A car with the check engine light on may not be my first choice.\n\nPlaintiff: This isn’t the first car I looked at. It was what I was looking for. I knew what I was looking for.\n\nJudge: So you go with him to AutoZone?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. He suggests, \"Let’s go to AutoZone.\" The guy there took the cord, whatever they use, and hooked it up to the car. He goes inside, looks up the computer, and says it only needs a $45 part. At this point, I don’t know if he knew that guy or what because I didn’t know that the hookup does not check the engine.\n\nJudge: That is what you were told when you brought it to the dealership?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What does the dealership say?\n\nPlaintiff: They said that AutoZone’s scanner does not diagnose full engine problems.\n\nJudge: So, you buy the car. How much did you pay?\n\nPlaintiff: $7,400 cash.\n\nJudge: You hand him the cash, and he puts it in his pockets?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. Then I drive the car home.\n\nJudge: What happens the next day?\n\nPlaintiff: I go to register it, start the car, and hear noises coming from underneath.\n\nJudge: Sounds that weren’t there when you test-drove it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, because when I went there, the car was already on.\n\nJudge: Why would the car be on when you got there?\n\nPlaintiff: He was sitting in the car with it on, waiting for me.\n\nJudge: And you didn’t turn it off and turn it on?\n\nPlaintiff: No. Now I know why it was on—because that’s when you hear the initial sounds.\n\nJudge: Did you have a mechanic check the car before buying it?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought AutoZone was sufficient.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happens after you take it to Nissan?\n\nPlaintiff: They tell me it needs $5,867.75 worth of work. I couldn’t afford to fix it, and I couldn’t reach him. So, I traded it in.\n\nJudge: For how much?\n\nPlaintiff: $4,000.\n\nJudge: So you lost $4,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and now I have a $310 car payment.\n\nJudge: Mr. Medina, did you ignore her calls?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor. I’m a truck driver. I was working. When I did answer, she was rude, and her boyfriend sent me messages saying, \"Handle this like a man.\"\n\nJudge: What did you tell her when she demanded her money back?\n\nDefendant: I told her the car was sold as-is. The car did not need all that work.\n\nJudge: Had you heard any noise from the car before selling it?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Then why did Nissan say it had serious issues?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. I had the car for three months with no problems. I only sold it because I wanted a motorcycle.\n\nJudge: Did you take it to a mechanic in those three months?\n\nDefendant: No, because it didn’t need anything.\n\nJudge: Ms. Zigler, did you read his Craigslist ad?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. It said it \"runs and drives great.\"\n\nJudge: That’s an opinion. Buyers have to test a used car before purchasing. Unfortunately, this is an \"as-is\" sale.

{"id": "950", "dialogue": "Judge: Tania Jenkins, you are suing Ryan Voorhees the second for 500, the amount of your insurance deductible, as a result of damage that he did to your car that you say was his fault. Tell me about what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: So, he is coming that way, and I'm turning in. Traffic is going this way. Back here is my daughter's Taekwondo class, so I'm turning in there, passing other buildings. I actually had to slow down because there is a dip. I get to here, and he collides here, hitting my tire. His skateboard goes under my vehicle.\n\nJudge: Did he get knocked down? Was he on the ground?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I looked up and he jumped off before.\n\nJudge: Did you jump off beforehand?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: How far away from the car did you jump off?\n\nDefendant: It was literally right when the board met the car. It was like a split-second reaction.\n\nJudge: So what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: I'm looking like, \"What in the world?\" And of course, we exchanged words.\n\nJudge: What were the exchange of words? Tell me the words exchanged.\n\nPlaintiff: I don't know the exact words, but I think I said something to the effect of, \"Watch where you're going.\" He's like, \"Watch where you're going.\"\n\nJudge: Did you ask him if he was okay?\n\nPlaintiff: I don't think I made it out of the car at that point. He says to me, \"Just drive forward and let me get my skateboard.\" So he's standing about right here doing like this, telling me to move forward. I move forward, and his skateboard ends up getting wedged under my back tire. He's doing this, so I end up going over his skateboard, and it cracks. He lost his mind.\n\nJudge: So what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff: By this time, he comes right back here, and he punches my car.\n\nJudge: Wait, he punched your car?\n\nPlaintiff: He punched my car.\n\nJudge: Where did he punch your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Right there.\n\nJudge: Do you have a picture? Did it make a dent?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it did.\n\nJudge: His fist did that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see your fist.\n\nDefendant: (Shows fist)\n\nJudge: I look like I weigh more than him. Did he turn into one of those Hulk fists? Why are you punching her car?\n\nDefendant: I was angry. She ran my board over.\n\nJudge: What are you, two? That's what somebody who's two does. It wasn't on purpose. It was called a car accident. What would entitle you to punch her car?\n\nDefendant: It was out of rage and anger.\n\nJudge: So you agree you need to pay for the repair of the car?\n\nDefendant: Well...\n\nJudge: Because I'm kind of shocked that you're suing for $89 to fix a skateboard, but you do agree you have to pay the $500?\n\nDefendant: I'm not sure. In fact, it would be more than $500. She's just suing you for the deductible. Your insurance company paid how much?\n\nPlaintiff: The difference of like $300 and something. When I first got the appraisal, it was $997. Then I went through my insurance, and the price dropped to $859. My insurance company paid $359. I'm just suing for the $500 I'm out.\n\nJudge: Now you have a counterclaim against her for $89.80 for the amount owed to fix your skateboard?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: You punched her car. But see, I feel that if you punched her car, you should be paying $900 for the punch. So who counterclaims to fix a skateboard?\n\nDefendant: Honestly, I feel like I'm not at fault because it was the initial wreck in the first place.\n\nJudge: You think because you were angry, you had a right to punch her car?\n\nDefendant: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Are you seriously saying that in a court of law? Are you crazy?\n\nDefendant's Mother: (Steps up) Are you kidding me?\n\nDefendant: It just happened so fast. I wasn't going extremely fast, just kind of steadily going. I looked down for like a split second, and I looked back up, and I see her car there.\n\nJudge: Yeah, don't look down. Tell me again how you think she should pay you $89 when you punched her car and caused her $800 in damages.\n\nDefendant: I understand.\n\nJudge: Does he have an anger control issue?\n\nDefendant's Mother: No, not usually.\n\nJudge: Were you surprised?\n\nDefendant's Mother: Very surprised.\n\nJudge: Sweetheart, are you going to be paying for the car that you punched?

You are counterclaiming against her, I guess, for half the cost of college?\n\nDefendant: No, not half the cost of college—she made no contribution to things like tuition.\n\nJudge: And so how do you pick $7,000 as the amount you're counterclaiming for?\n\nDefendant: Massachusetts law limits the amount I can sue for in this court.\n\nJudge: I see. How much was college in total?\n\nDefendant: I paid about $207,000 for both boys.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you're suing for the most you can sue for. It's a tiny fraction of what you actually paid for college because, according to you, she's supposed to pay for half of that. All right. Let's talk to you first. Tell me about why you're here today.\n\nPlaintiff: We have two sons. The oldest, who's now 29, was married last June. Steve and I had been in conversation about paying for the rehearsal dinner, some flowers to go along with the rehearsal dinner that were going to be repurposed and used at the wedding the following day, and then the day after, there was a brunch held at the bride's family home.\n\nJudge: So that was the agreement you folks reached with the mother and father of the bride?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, exactly.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I kept Steve in the loop.\n\nJudge: What was he telling you when you told him that?\n\nPlaintiff: \"Fine, no problem. You and I will split it. No problem at all.\"\n\nJudge: So what happens on the day of the rehearsal dinner?\n\nPlaintiff: He had dinner. His mother and father were in from Florida. When I was seeing them down to their car—his dad had fallen the week before and was really bruised up—I helped them down. By the time I got back up to the second floor, he was gone for the evening.\n\nJudge: So he wasn't there when the check came?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I paid the bill. We had the wedding on Saturday. It was a lovely wedding. It was fabulous. Then the brunch happened the following day.\n\nJudge: Did you say something to him at the wedding? Like, \"You weren’t there to help pay\" or anything?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn't want to start anything then. It wouldn't have been appropriate.\n\nJudge: Did he go to the brunch?\n\nPlaintiff: He did.\n\nJudge: Did you discuss money with him then or did you wait until later?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn't discuss it at the brunch. He said to me that he would be getting back to me about the money. I didn’t have all the receipts yet.\n\nJudge: So when did you give him the receipts, and how?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave him the receipts the following Saturday on July 2nd. I hand-delivered them to his house.\n\nJudge: And what did he do?\n\nPlaintiff: Nothing.\n\nJudge: What did he say? \"I’m not paying this?\"\n\nPlaintiff: No. For several months, whenever I would either bump into him or speak to him on the phone, he would say, \"Yeah, I’m going to get you the money. I’m going to pay you.\" At one point, I was with my other son, and we saw Steve, and I said to him, \"Do you think that you could get back to me on that?\" because it was all on my credit card, and it was troublesome. He said he would pay me.\n\nJudge: And he didn’t?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: When did you learn that he had no intention of paying you?\n\nPlaintiff: In late October.\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: I saw him right before I moved, and he said, \"I don’t owe you a cent.\" Then he turned and walked away. That was the last time we spoke.\n\nJudge: Had you two been fighting about something else before that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Why do you think the change happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Let's hear from you, Stephen. Did you agree to pay for half of the wedding cost?\n\nDefendant: No. Never.\n\nJudge: Why is she under the impression that you did?\n\nDefendant: Because she doesn't ask—she tells. She kept on telling me many times that this is what we're doing. The first time she brought it up, I told her I had to go to the bathroom—just to avoid the conversation.\n\nJudge: You sure you weren’t just saying \"yes\" to avoid confrontation and figured you’d sort it out later?\n\nDefendant: No, I was avoiding it.\n\nJudge: And after the wedding?\n\nDefendant: I avoided it until I told her outright, \"Forget it. I’m not paying.\"\n\nJudge: Do you believe you shouldn't have to pay?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She never contributed to any of the college expenses, and our divorce decree states we’d \"attempt to agree\" on contributions. She contributed zero.\n\nJudge: I’ve read the decree. That phrase doesn't impose financial responsibility. But when you tell someone you'll pay half, and they rely on it financially, that's a contract. I’m ruling in favor of the plaintiff for $3,158.36.

{"id": "756", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Miss Jordan, you're suing your home inspector because according to you, he missed that there was mold damage on your house that you bought. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff (Lisa Jordan):** Yes, your honor. I moved from Massachusetts after my mother passed away, and I wanted to purchase a home in Florida. I purchased a home on November 7th, 2021.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I had contacted the listing agent and asked her if she knew of an inspector, and she gave me Mr. Casten’s phone number. So I contacted him, and he came and did an inspection on November 15, 2021. I came to see him on the day of the inspection, and I had noticed a black circle on the ceiling in the kitchen. I pointed it out to him and asked him what he thought of it, and his response was, \"Well, it's probably old and nothing to worry about.\" On November 18, I received the report via email. He then mentioned in the report that that circle was actually a wet or moist stain.\n\n**Judge:** Mhm.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was never hinted to me or suggested to me that it could be mold. It did say to get a contractor.\n\n**Judge:** You're not from here, are you? That’s the thing. See, I’m Floridian, and we know how moist we are. So he tells you it's wet and you should get a specialist contractor to look at it, but that didn't alert you? You feel that the report didn’t properly warn you that you needed to get a mold inspection? What did you think it was when you pointed it out to him? Weren’t you worried it was mold?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, like I said, when I first asked him about it, he said, \"It’s probably dry and old. Don’t worry about it.\" But then he puts in the report that it’s moist, and he includes a picture of the moisture factor.\n\n**Judge:** And he tells you to see another contractor about this. Do you ever pick up the phone and call him and say, \"What type of contractor should I see? Do you have a recommendation on who I should hire?\" Do you ever call a mold specialist now that you know the spot is wet?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I didn’t feel I was properly alerted by his report.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Let me hear from you, Mr. Casten. She says you were deficient in your job. Let me hear from you.\n\n**Defendant (Wayne Casten):** She is correct in everything she says. However, in the State of Florida, you have to have a mold license to start saying the word \"mold.\" Unless I’ve tested it and I know that it's mold, I can't say, \"Hey, you have mold.\" I don’t even want to alert anybody because I don’t want to create a false panic. So we need to get it tested first.\n\n**Judge:** Right.\n\n**Defendant:** I sent her an email and let her know that—\n\n**Judge:** You sent her an email and told her what?\n\n**Defendant:** Even before she paid for the report, I sent her an email. I said, \"Look, you know that discussion we had when you were there? I was wrong. After you left, I tested it with two different devices.\"\n\n**Judge:** So you not only put it in the report, you sent her an email?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I did.\n\n**Judge:** *[Reading from email]* \"The stain by the kitchen was leaking after all. Inside the cabinet against the wall was wet. A roofer or handyman will need to seal that area of the roof/wall as needed to stop the water intrusion.\" What does he need to do, hit you over the head with a baseball bat, Miss Jordan? I mean, he even sends you the email telling you that you need to look into this, and you don’t look into it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I wanted to hear \"mold.\" I wanted to hear, \"Hire a mold inspector.\" I’m not an inspector or a mold specialist.\n\n**Judge:** He’s not allowed to. He’s actually right about that. He’s not allowed to conclude it’s mold and cause a panic. But let’s see what he says. He has a picture of the spot with arrows and the title \"Wet Stain Detected.\" He has a picture of the moisture level detected. And then—where's this wet stain that you have underneath it?\n\n**Defendant:** That was directly below everything above, which is below the cabinets. There was another cabinet at the bottom that you had to open up to see inside.\n\n**Judge:** This was really incumbent upon you to take the next steps. \"The cause of the stain should be investigated to determine whether the condition is due to a single event or something that could occur again. Note that the home inspection cannot fully assess the extent of damage as this often involves invasive activities such as removing finishes, etc. Recommend a qualified contractor further evaluate and repair as needed.\" And you don’t even call him to say what kind of contractor, or anything else? You were fine with it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I wasn’t fine with it.\n\n**Judge:** Well, if you weren’t fine with it, why didn’t you get another qualified contractor to further evaluate the wet spot?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I contacted Mr. Dry.\n\n**Judge:** Who’s Mr. Dry?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A remediation company.\n\n**Judge:** Right. But that was after you closed, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** So your entire lawsuit is based on being misled, or him doing his job negligently, because if you had only been warned, you would have gotten in a specialist? You might not have bought the house? Because you would then have learned that it would cost you $7,450?\n\n**Judge:** I’m not going to order him to pay for your mold remediation and cabinet replacement. I feel like he did exactly what his job is. In fact, he went above and beyond by emailing you to let you know that a discussion you had wasn’t valid anymore. I find in favor of the defendant in this case.\n\n**Judge:** *[To Plaintiff]* How do you feel after hearing everything?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I still feel I wasn’t properly alerted that it could be mold. I don’t live in Florida—I don’t know that seeing moisture automatically means mold.\n\n**Judge:** Well, you've learned a tough lesson the hard way.\n\n**Judge:** *[To Defendant]* Is it the law that you can’t use the word \"mold\" even to hint at it?\n\n**Defendant:** From past experience, we don’t want to use the word \"mold\" unless we know for sure, because it can kill a deal real fast, and I don’t want to be responsible for that.\n\n**Judge:** You did a good job.

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says his high-strung niece attacked his truck during an argument. The defendant says she never laid a hand on the vehicle. It’s the case of trucking things up. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: All right, Mr. Hodge, Miss Gorman is your niece?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Wow, okay. And how so? Like your…?\n\nPlaintiff: My sister’s daughter.\n\nJudge: Okay, and um, the two of you were visiting? I guess this happened when?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, 11/23/17. Thanksgiving.\n\nJudge: Thanksgiving, yeah. All right, so you’re visiting your mother?\n\nPlaintiff: I was at my mom’s house, yes.\n\nJudge: And she comes over to visit her grandmother?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: And what happens, according to you?\n\nPlaintiff: A little verbal argument. My niece made a comment to me about something. I had just gotten out of the hospital that day, actually, and my niece made a comment to me that I should have died in the hospital.\n\nJudge: Okay, and it was… that sounds to me, to my trained ear, like you two already had a problem. So what was your problem? You didn’t get along with your niece?\n\nPlaintiff: We have… we’ve had our differences over the years. Minor arguments, little tiffs over family issues and stuff like that.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so she tells you you should have died in the hospital. And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: We got into a little bit more of an argument. She said a couple of more things and…\n\nJudge: How old is Grandma?\n\nPlaintiff: Mom? Mom at the time was 86.\n\nJudge: Okay. That’s pleasant. It’s Thanksgiving.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: We’re at the home of an 86-year-old, and the two of you engage in this. What did you say to him? Did you say to him, “I wish you died at the hospital”?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not say anything.\n\nJudge: What was it you said that caused the problem?\n\nDefendant: We were arguing because he came home.\n\nJudge: What were you arguing about?\n\nDefendant: About him not feeding my grandmother. She was in bed, laying in bed at almost midnight, crying that she hadn’t eaten all day.\n\nJudge: At midnight?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So didn’t all this happen… did it happen before midnight?\n\nPlaintiff: I had come home from the hospital around maybe 8:00 p.m.\n\nJudge: Okay. And what time were you visiting after that?\n\nDefendant: Around 11:00 p.m.\n\nJudge: Yes?\n\nDefendant: I came home from dinner with my parents that night.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you were visiting your grandmother at 11:00 p.m.?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because I went to go see her to pay my respects to her on Thanksgiving.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then you get there, and then she says, “I haven’t been fed all day”?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, she was laying in bed crying, and I asked her what had happened. And she said that he was complaining since he got home from the hospital that there was no toilet paper in the house.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And I feel like that shouldn’t be her responsibility.\n\nJudge: He was in the hospital.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Yes, he just had a heart attack.\n\nDefendant: But he also has two kids that could be helping her as well.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what did you say to him?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t say nothing. We got into a verbal dispute.\n\nJudge: Obviously, you got into a verbal dispute, and then what happened?\n\nDefendant: And then we… one thing led to another, and I left.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nDefendant: And then he accused me of damaging his vehicle.\n\nJudge: Okay, you tell me what you say happened. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: The argument—she made the statement about, you know, that I should have passed away in the hospital.\n\nJudge: By the way, had you left your mother, your 86-year-old mother, without food between 8:00 and midnight?\n\nPlaintiff: I was in the hospital for 10 days, but my daughter—\n\nJudge: Who is that with you?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s my daughter.\n\nJudge: Stand up, please. Come forward. Were you living in that house or staying in that house, or were you there for Thanksgiving?\n\nDaughter: No, I was visiting.\n\nJudge: When did you visit there? What time?\n\nDaughter: I got there about 11:30.\n\nJudge: While the fight was going on?\n\nDaughter: At 11:30, yes.\n\nJudge: And everybody just visits Grandma at 11:30? Grandma doesn’t sleep?\n\nDaughter: No, she stays up all night actually.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you go to visit Grandma at 11:30, and the fight’s going on?\n\nDaughter: Yeah.\n\n...(Full transcript continues)...\n\nJudge: I’m finding in favor of the plaintiff in this case. I’m awarding him the remainder after the $300 he’s already received, for a total of $1,650. Verdict for the plaintiff. Good luck, folks.\n\nDefendant: (Outside the courtroom) The judge thinks I did it, obviously. That’s good for him. I mean, you had the weakest denial I’ve ever heard. Did you do it or not?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nReporter: Then who did?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. We park in a very bad neighborhood. And you know what? He lied. He can’t see six stories up, three blocks, four blocks down. So that’s—you know what? He wants some money, he got it, he took me here.\n\nReporter: What a wonderful family situation you guys have going.\n\nDefendant: Horrible, horrible family situation. Horrible that family has to be this way.\n\nReporter: Boy, I feel sorry for you.\n\nReporter: Mr. Hodge, you may have won the case, but what a terrible family situation.\n\nPlaintiff: Family dynamics aren’t doing too well, but maybe they can sort themselves out someday.\n\nReporter: I think you got to be a part of it.

{"id": "273", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you. Douglas Parker, you're suing Miss Logan, your I guess former friend, for $1,817, the estimate you've received in order to repair your car that according to you she damaged. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): So we went to the bar on the 5th of August and we met up with her ex-boyfriend which I had... where?\n\nJudge: At the bar?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): At the bar. She told me he was going to be there but I didn't know that the ex-girlfriend was going to... the girlfriend was going to be there.\n\nJudge: Okay, so when we got there she was basically antagonizing the girlfriend?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yeah, she was drinking and I said, \"You going?\" How was she antagonizing?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Like saying little comments.\n\nJudge: Wait, were you all together?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Mhmm, me, her, and my cousin were sitting across from her ex-boyfriend and his girlfriend.\n\nJudge: How did you manage to be sitting across from them?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): 'Cause the bar is small.\n\nJudge: So then she would say comments loud enough for the girl to hear?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): She wasn't saying loud enough, no.\n\nJudge: What was she saying? How was she antagonizing her?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Just basically kept staring at them, basically making it known that her presence was there. So we ordered a pitcher of sangria, uh-huh, and we were just having fun. I said, \"You going to be designated driver?\" She said yes. Then we came outside, the girlfriend called her friends and they were kicking my car and saying they were trying to fight us. She was driving and wound up backing up into a parked truck.\n\nJudge: Wait, hold on. So you're walking to your car and are those other women out there?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yeah, ready to fight us. I didn’t know how they... how did you know they were ready to fight you? What did they say or do?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): \"Get out the car, fight me, you all here being crazy.\"\n\nJudge: You were already in the car then?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, she was in the car. I'm walking to my car.\n\nJudge: Okay, so she's already inside the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): 'Cause she knew them. She saw them.\n\nJudge: So you're already in, you get inside the car first?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, I did not.\n\nJudge: How did that happen that you guys have the confrontation outside?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): We were walking to the vehicle and I went to the passenger side and she was on the driver's side. She said, \"Hold up.\" Wait, you said you were driving, and then I went to the driver's side. And while I'm walking to the driver's side, that's when they made a comment. \"Oh, who got the problem?\" and all this nonsense. And they started to walk over to the vehicle and called the issue.\n\nJudge: Alright, so you don't confront them at any point?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Get in the car. Everybody closes the doors. And then what happens? How did the accident happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): When we got inside of the vehicle, I was trying to, uh, exit, well, reverse, but you know, they were right there at the window. So we were having like a little argument, and then that's when they was like, \"Did you roll down your window?\" or did you... what?\n\nJudge: Well, I was on the driver's side, so I did not roll down the window. She rolled down the passenger side window to argue back with them.\n\nJudge: So are they on her side or your side?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): They were on her side. Then they came—my ex-boyfriend actually came to the driver's side to try and yell at me, but the window was still rolled up.\n\nJudge: To yell at you for what?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Whatever the issue may be or what was the issue? Why were you there?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): I don’t know. How long ago did you and your boyfriend break up?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Maybe a year ago.\n\nJudge: So yeah, so did you go there because you thought he was going to be there?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, no.\n\nJudge: So you have nothing to do with him?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Nothing to do with him at all. So I don’t know where she gets on where we having a conversation.\n\nJudge: So in any event, you're driving the car and what goes wrong?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Well, she was telling me to run them over, reverse, and back up and things of that sort. So therefore, in the midst of me doing that for about two minutes, I backed into the truck.\n\nJudge: So what happened? What went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Well, what went wrong is her telling, yelling, \"Oh, to run them over,\" and to, you know, go forward. What actually, okay, what went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): She wasn't paying attention. And what happened then?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): She backed up into a parked truck.\n\nJudge: Do me a favor. Go up to the board and show me how the parking area was.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Alright, so if the... you know, the person who’s driving basically did the owner of the car a favor because that person was drunk. Do they have to pay even if they’re negligent?\n\nJudge: I don’t think so. I mean, it’s not my fault if you're like drunk and I'm... yeah, but it's your fault if you're negligent.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): I mean, that's a good answer.\n\nJudge: What do you say? Kind of gray area on that. I think the defendant's responsible 'cause they were the one driving. The plaintiff is responsible by not driving knowing they’re drunk. Somebody's got to win and somebody’s got to lose, that’s the deal.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom, so this is the concrete, these are the spots. Got these? These are the other spots? Gotcha. The girls are right here. The car is coming out here. The parked car is like literally right here. She backs up this way, and arguing with her boyfriend right here. And this mad girl is over here attacking us. And then she backs up and I'm like, \"Just go, just go.\" And then out we go.\n\nJudge: Okay, so she hit the car that was legally parked behind her in the other row?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Mhmm. Gotcha.\n\nJudge: So where does the \"just go, just go\" part happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): If I'm the owner of that car, I can just eat it when I walk out and see that it’s damaged. I didn’t want to get jumped.\n\nJudge: So you immediately reported the accident to the police, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, 'cause she said...\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Exactly.\n\nJudge: Exactly. Did you... you were the driver?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): No.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Because after that, we pulled into a parking lot next door, and she drove the car back to her.\n\nJudge: It doesn’t matter. What does that have to do with it? You just hit a parked car. Did anybody bother to report that? Because that’s a leaving the scene of an accident. That’s a crime.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Who’s that gentleman?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): My father. My daughter’s dad. Come on up. Come on up.\n\nJudge: Do you teach your baby that way to treat that?\n\nDefendant’s Father: No, I don’t.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: That’s right. ‘Cause that’s pretty bad to leave that person if you have $1,800 worth of damage. That person has damage too, and they literally just walk out of a bar and see their car was, you know, the victim of a hit and run.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): I went to talk to the owner of the restaurant, and there were no damages to the car. And he... I went to go look. I went back the next day. Took pictures of that.\n\nJudge: Wait, and what then?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): The truck is still there.\n\nJudge: Yep. Whose truck was it?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): It’s owned by the restaurant.\n\nJudge: It’s just a parked vehicle that they have there.\n\nJudge: Alright, now according to you, the damage... well, let me ask you what happens, because at the beginning, she’s apologetic, and she says, \"Take it in. You fix it.\" You have the tail light fixed by her mechanic, and then the mechanic tells you that he can fix the whole thing for like another $500 and something, or $800 after he took that tail light out, and the part that holds the tail light, like the frame, was bent in. And he said, \"It'll cost more money. Who could pull the dent out?\"\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): And I’m looking at it, and I’m like, you can’t pull a dent out of the metal like the way it was crashed in. Like, there’s no way to repair that. It has to be a new one put in and a new bumper.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): So you don’t know that?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Well, how do you know that? You’re not... You can look at it and tell.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, but you can’t look at it and tell anymore.\n\nJudge: I can. I can look at it and tell. I’ve been doing this for years now. So did you take it to another place?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yeah, I went to my mechanic.\n\nJudge: Okay. And what did your mechanic tell you?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): He said that the whole thing had to be replaced, and a new bumper.\n\nJudge: So do you have that in writing from your mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see it.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): And do you have a picture of the damage?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yes.\n\nJudge: Let me see that. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Oh, yeah, that’s bad.\n\nJudge: Your position is, I shouldn’t have to eat this alone, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Well, that, or she can get the amount for the bumper that my mechanic... that she already took my mechanic to, and he started the work, and he can finish it.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t he just finish it then?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Because I did not have the money to give him, and that’s actually a bone of contention with you, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Because she told you you need to wait for it, because I don’t have the money yet.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): And then what? She went to a trip to Miami, which she already... we all know how expensive Miami is. But when did she go on a trip to Miami?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): How much later?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Probably like two months later.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Which month later?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Yeah, already booked.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Was it two months already booked?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Yes, already booked two months later.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Yep.\n\nJudge: You don’t buy that?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No, ‘cause we were talking about it. Her birthday was the same month that she was supposed to go to Miami. She was contemplating on who she was going to go with to Miami.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): No, I wasn’t.\n\nJudge: Okay, I need you to stop. Alright? ‘Cause you crashed your car, so take it down a notch.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Alright.\n\nJudge: And the next thing you know, then she’s in Miami. In Miami, and you feel like if she can go to Miami and spend all that money in Miami, then she can pay to get your car fixed?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Saying that she’ll pay for all expenses?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): It was never...\n\nJudge: Can I see the promiser?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): Now I, Jasmine Logan, hereby promise to pay all expenses to repair Miss Parker’s Honda Accord for damages I caused on at 12:20 a.m.\n\nJudge: When was this signed?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): That night.\n\nJudge: That night?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): While I... whose idea was this?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Very good.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Mine.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Not mine.\n\nJudge: Oh, sorry. That’s alright. Very good. Where’d you learn that?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Watching The People’s Court.\n\nJudge: Yep.\n\nJudge: Okay. I am, uh, based on what I have heard, I’m going to find in favor of the plaintiff in this case and the amount of the estimate for $1,817. That’s my verdict. It’s not unreasonable.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Hold on there please.\n\nJudge: Well, the plaintiff does prevail. Miss Logan, the defendant, come out of the court.\n\nJudge: You know, there’s something I heard that I really want to ask you about. I had heard that you drove because you said she was too drunk to drive.\n\nJudge: Coming out toxicated, she had four glasses of sangria and she knew she was drunk and you were driving with her, yet she only drove a block and then you let her drive.\n\nJudge: Is that right?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Yeah, because, you know, after an accident, I guess her adrenaline kicked in and she had common sense to drive her vehicle home.\n\nJudge: Were you with her when she drove back to your vehicle?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Yes.\n\nJudge: And she was okay driving?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Oh, yeah.\n\nJudge: And okay to write that letter?\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Well, yeah. That was pretty smart of her, wasn’t it?\n\nJudge: Got to give her credit for that. Guess all right. That’s alright. Thank you very much.\n\nDefendant (Jasmine Logan): Okay, thank you very much.\n\nJudge: Now here comes Miss Parker. That was intriguing, that you wanted her to drive because she thought you were too drunk. Do you feel like you were too drunk to drive?\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): No.\n\nPlaintiff (Kara Parker): And you drove driving.

{"id": "390", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to the People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff rented to the defendant. One day, without any warning, the defendant said he was leaving the country and left the apartment a mess. But the defendant says the place was like a zoo—there were so many pests, and not his. It's the case of \"I owe you nothing.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mr. Cororo, you are suing your former tenant, Kevin Blackwood, for $880.50 that you say he owes you and refuses to pay. You are counterclaiming, Mr. Blackwood, for security deposit and some other items that we’ll go into. Let’s hear from you first. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: The story begins back in October of 2013. I rented a cottage to Mr. Blackwood. I have a copy of the lease with a check that shows the one-month security.\n\nJudge: Okay. And the lease stipulates that he would pay the utilities? Is the cottage on your property?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can I have that? What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: So we had a great relationship for over three years, and Kevin sent me a text on November 19th of 2016 that said he thinks he outgrew the place, that he wanted to discuss moving. So we talked, and I said, \"Please give us as much notice as possible, and by law, you need to give us 30 days' notice.\" That was on November 19th, 2016.\n\nPlaintiff: On December 1st, 2016, at 4:00 a.m., I received a text from Mr. Blackwood that said, \"I am leaving the country on December 14th. You can have the place back on December 15th.\"\n\nJudge: Had he paid December rent?\n\nPlaintiff: No. And when I discussed this with him, he said, \"Well, you have my security.\"\n\nPlaintiff: The day after getting this text, I went over to see him, and he wasn’t there. I had this funny feeling, so I peeked in the windows, and all his furnishings were gone. There was just a bunch of garbage and boxes. So we tried to contact him. We called him and said we’d like to meet him there that evening.\n\nJudge: To talk to him about what?\n\nPlaintiff: About him moving out.\n\nJudge: What’s to talk about? He’s moving out. What did you want to talk about?\n\nPlaintiff: When we could get into the place because we were still going on the basis that he said we couldn’t have access until the 15th.\n\nJudge: What did he say? Did he agree to show up?\n\nPlaintiff: No. So then we talked to him again, and then he had one excuse after another. Then we received a text after a phone conversation, and he said, \"Well, now I don’t understand why we need to meet. You can have the place back on the 14th.\"\n\nJudge: What are you suing for?\n\nPlaintiff: Utilities because they came in after he left.\n\nJudge: So he didn’t pay? According to you, he didn’t pay utilities from October 17th to November 16th and also from November 17th to December 10th?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you agree that’s accurate?\n\nDefendant: That’s accurate.\n\nJudge: So that’s not a debate. But according to you, he damaged some things, and that’s why you are suing him. Tell me what he damaged.\n\nPlaintiff: Three things: hardwood floors, cleaning costs and garbage removal, and a hole in the wall.\n\nJudge: How did the hole get there? Do you know?\n\nPlaintiff: He claims that he heard something in the wall, so he punched a hole in the wall.\n\nJudge: Did he tell you he was going to do that beforehand because he was hearing critters in the walls?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you just kind of found it that way?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I can see that’s rusty and kind of gross. What is this a picture of?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s the damage. Basically, he had a desk and a computer workstation set up, and obviously, nothing to protect the floor, so it just completely wore the floor out. And this is all the junk he left behind.\n\nJudge: What happened? Why was everything so precipitous and in the middle of the night?\n\nDefendant: From day one, Steve is correct—we did have a good relationship.\n\nJudge: So sad you all are here then.\n\nDefendant: I was sort of at the edge when I left. The reason for that is I had some pests in the apartment that we couldn’t get rid of. The reason why I put a hole in the wall is because there was actually a critter around that area. I mentioned to Steve that I did that. I didn’t just punch a hole in the wall; I actually drilled the hole. That jagged hole—it moved the critter to the other side of the house.\n\nJudge: Did you ever hire a professional to check the eaves, bring bait to get the animal out?\n\nDefendant: Every time I threatened to call an exterminator, guess who showed up? Always there.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you just call the exterminator?\n\nDefendant: I should have. But every time I got on the phone, he showed up.\n\nJudge: Don’t threaten. Just shut your mouth and call the exterminator.\n\nJudge: On your lawsuit against Mr. Blackwood, I find in your favor in the amount of $880. On Mr. Blackwood’s lawsuit against Mr. Cororo, I am ruling zero. That is my verdict.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I moved in with him in November of 2012. Everything was fine at first. The first incident happened—\n\nJudge: Did you two know each other beforehand?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I met him through a friend of mine. It was a quick decision—I needed a place, and I moved in.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: The first incident happened in March of 2013. He took the keys to my truck—a Ford Explorer. I drive a tow truck, and he took all my equipment. He took my booster box, which was worth 150. I had just bought it. He took my toolbox, worth 500. A brand new radio I installed—he took that, too. He took my GPS.\n\nJudge: How do you know he took it?\n\nPlaintiff: He called me on December 15th of 2015 and admitted that he stole my money two years ago.\n\nJudge: Wait—two years earlier?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, two years ago. He told me that he had stolen my car.\n\nJudge: When did you stop living there?\n\nPlaintiff: In 2015.\n\nJudge: So it wasn’t until 2015, when things escalated, that he called and admitted to stealing your truck?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Let’s talk about the truck first. You eventually found it, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. The truck was recovered. I drive a tow truck, and my company got a call from the police department.\n\nJudge: That’s coincidental. So your tow truck company actually got the call to recover your stolen truck?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How long after it was stolen was that?\n\nPlaintiff: About eight months later.\n\nJudge: And how was it found?\n\nPlaintiff: It was sitting on the street, unmoved.\n\nJudge: So it sat there for eight months, and no one reported it?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s right.\n\nJudge: Was it accumulating tickets?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it was parked legally.\n\nJudge: What did you do with the truck once it was recovered?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have the title or keys anymore. It was gone so long I assumed it was chopped up. I threw them out, so I had to junk the truck.\n\nJudge: Let’s talk about the money now. You claim that in August of 2014, money was stolen from you. Tell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff: I had $2,400 because I was looking to move out. I mentioned to him that I had the money. The next morning, it was gone.\n\nJudge: You mentioned to him that you had the money? Why?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a mistake.\n\nJudge: But why would you do that if you didn’t trust him?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought that if I told him where it was, he wouldn’t take it. I figured if he knew I knew where it was, he wouldn’t steal it. But it disappeared anyway.\n\nJudge: Did anyone else live in the house?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did either of you have guests?\n\nPlaintiff: He had guests.\n\nJudge: Did you call the police when the money was gone?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to the precinct, but they wouldn’t take a report because I couldn’t prove who took the money.\n\nJudge: Did you confront him?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t mention it until I was moving out. When I did, I told him, “Just admit you took the $2,400.” He didn’t say anything.\n\nJudge: And then in December of 2015, he called you and admitted to taking your money and truck?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Felix Ortiz, what’s your response?\n\nDefendant: I work hard. I take care of myself. I never steal from anyone.\n\nJudge: What was the living situation? Were you a renter?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I was paying rent. We lived in a two-bedroom apartment. He had a room, and I made the living room my room. We shared the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nJudge: Did you get along at first?\n\nDefendant: Yes, we were fine at first.\n\nJudge: When did things change?\n\nDefendant: About six months after he moved in, he started acting strangely. He would curse a lot. I had to call the ambulance for him twice—if I hadn’t, he could have died.\n\nJudge: Did you steal his car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you admit to stealing his car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you steal his money?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you admit to stealing his money?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Why do you think he’s suing you?\n\nDefendant: He’s also asking for his security deposit back, but he didn’t pay rent for February or March before moving out. I kept the deposit to cover that.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof that you paid rent for February and March?\n\nPlaintiff: I paid him, but I don’t have receipts. The only receipt I have is from when I first moved in.\n\nJudge: If you’re paying cash, it’s on you to get a receipt. How are you going to prove you paid?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have proof.\n\nJudge: Do you have any proof that he admitted to stealing your truck or money? Any texts, emails, witnesses?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Based on what I’ve heard, I have no choice but to rule in favor of the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: This isn’t fair. An ex-con wins again.\n\nJudge: This case is dismissed.\n\n[After the verdict, outside the courtroom]\n\nReporter: Mr. Bottomly, you didn’t have enough evidence to prove your case. Any comments?\n\nPlaintiff: I’ll take him back to court and do my homework next time.\n\nReporter: Mr. Ortiz, your thoughts?\n\nDefendant: I tried to help him, but people take advantage. I told the truth, and the judge saw that.\n\nReporter: Thank you.

{"id": "235", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the defendant Kenneth Deuchi he says he's been a licensed plumber for 30 years and he performed a gas pressure test at the plaintiff's place of business. The plaintiff's business was in shambles, the gas had been turned off for a decade and the town rejected his test over a technicality. He's done hundreds of tests in the town before without a problem. The town rejected the test because the plate had had the gas turned off for so long and he can't try to blame him and ask him for his money back because he did the required work properly. He's accused of not passing gas. All parties please your rans, welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff hired the defendant who said that he was allowed to work in the town where he was doing the job, but the town said you don't have a license here. The defendant says it got rejected on a technicality. It's the case of the plumber cracks me up, thank you. Douglas Pasta Machines Incorporated represented here by Michael Wilson, you're the owner, yes? You're suing Kenneth Deuchi, doing business as Ken the Plumber for $591.97 to do some work that was of no use to you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Um, it was in December of 2014. Um, we had had the gas shut off at our building for approximately a year and a half.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Um, because I decided to use a wood stove. I purchased a wood stove, very large wood stove, and we're using the wood stove for heat in the winters, because the gas prices were so high at the time. So we're using a wood stove.\n\nJudge: What kind of a business is it?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): It's a pasta manufacturing company.\n\nJudge: You make the machines?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, we make the pasta machines. Commercial machines.\n\nJudge: Yes, ma'am.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): In any event, um, so as long as you don’t say \"yes, sir\" when I’m out of the RO. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): In any event, the employees were, it was a very bad year that year, the temperature went really, really down low very early in the season. So, you know, I had to get the gas hook back up. I agree.\n\nJudge: Your employees wanted you to get the gas back?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, because it was, you know, cold. The wood stove wasn't cutting the mustard.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): So, in any event, so uh, we called, I looked on the internet first. I called the gas company and told them to come hook up the gas. The gas company said, “Um, your gas has been turned off for more than a year so we can't bring that...”\n\nJudge: How long had it been turned off for?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): According to you by then, about a year and 3/4.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Okay. Yeah, so we said they said you can't get the gas hooked up unless you have someone come in and do what's called a leak test, a pressure test or a leak test, they're both the same thing.\n\nJudge: So the leak test was for the gas company?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, the gas company had to see a leak test performed by and they said it has to be a licensed Master Plumber. That's the only person that can do the leak test for gas. It has to be a master plumber, not just any plumber.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Okay, so I looked on the internet, and I came, uh, you know, I looked at several different people, and I came across a Kender grunt's, um, site. Actually, it was his listing, and it said that, uh, you know, I got a, there were a lot of good reviews. So I said, I picked him.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): So, my sec, I had my secretary call him and make an appointment to come and you get a price for the gas test and come and do it so that we could get the gas hooked up, which is, that's what she told him.\n\nJudge: So he comes and he does the leak test. Did you talk to him before he did any tests?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Me personally?\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): No. So whatever conversation he had with your secretary, he comes and he does the leak test. He gives you the results, and what were the results?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): We... well, the first time we didn't pass it, then he did something and then the second time he did it we passed.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Okay, okay, so now we said, here, and I said, so this is all we need to, uh, to show to the, to the, um, gas company so that we could get the gas hooked up. He said, yep, that's all you need.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): And you had paid him how much?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): $591.97.\n\nJudge: And then what happened that all of a sudden that wasn't worth anything to you?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Well, we faxed the copy of the test, the pass where it said passed on it to the gas company, and the gas company said, \"Excuse me, he's not on the list of licensed plumbers in the Town of Babylon. We can't accept that. He has to be on the list of licensed plumbers in the Town of Babylon.\"\n\nJudge: They told you that before then?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): No, they had just said Master Plumber.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yeah, I didn’t call up to find out, you know, who I should pick. They, and besides, they said we don’t recommend anybody.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): The gas company said.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): And then they, and then they tell you, we don’t recommend anybody but no, that one's not good enough.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Right, right. After I spent $591.97?\n\nJudge: And they tell you he's not on the list of licensed plumbers in that particular town.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Are you licensed?\n\nJudge: I am licensed.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Where are you licensed?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): I’m not licensed in Babylon, where his building is. Where are you licensed?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): I'm licensed in Oyster Bay, just about everywhere else.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): May I see any of your LIC?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Absolutely.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): So I called him up. I said, listen, we got a problem here, they won't accept your leak test because you're not in the town, you're not licensed to do business in the town of Babylon.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): He said, well, I had a license in the Town of Babylon but it expired and I never renewed it.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Oh, well, that's just great. I mean, I presumed that that was on his, you know, it was listed which I thought was Town of Babylon, but it's Town of Oyster Bay, so therefore I presumed that he was. And besides, he should know that he's not allowed legally.\n\nJudge: By the way, also, your yellow pages say serving Babylon, don't they?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Not really.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): Really, but not really.\n\nJudge: Oh, really? My Yellow Pages doesn't say serving Babylon.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I don't have a yellow page.\n\nJudge: What's this? Don't make this stuff up. Who handed me this? Did you, did you print out these little yellow page things?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, doesn't that say serving Babylon?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I don't know where you got this from, but Yellow Pages online.\n\nJudge: I’m telling you, the Yellow Pages had.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): All right, well I guess they never took it down.\n\nJudge: Let me just ask. Do you do work in Babylon?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): Yes, I do. And if I need to pull a permit in Babylon, what I do is I go and get a reciprocal license, pay the fee, and I get a license.\n\nJudge: What’s the reciprocal license fee?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): Um, it's about 100 bucks.\n\nJudge: You mean I’m here over 100 bucks, you couldn’t just go do it?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): ‘Cause the license would help you anyway. Then you got a license for Babylon, and if anybody needs a permit pulled for license work, you’ve got the license.\n\nJudge: Well, this is what happened, he called me up some two weeks later. Um, if you look at my contract with his secretary, and that’s who hired me, can I see the contract with his secretary?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): Absolutely. It has gas pressure test and job complete on it, signed with a copy of the check.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): So, anyway, he called me up and said I need a permit for this job. And I said, well why do you need a permit for the job?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): And he said, well, the gas has been off so long that they’re requiring a permit. Generally, the gas company just requires that a licensed Master Plumber, which I am, does the test.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I'm licensed and insured.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): Have you done this before?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I've done 100 gas PR tests.\n\nJudge: So this guy has a license but not in the city where he did the work. Is that deceptive?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Um, it's deceptive.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): I mean, uh, underhanded.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Okay, yeah, I think he's lying.\n\nJudge: So I don't think it was fair that he worked there. I'm glad we got that square. What do you think?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, he is very deceptive because, uh, a license is what the state gives the person the right in the city.\n\nJudge: The city. Right.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): But he doesn't have it in that City, so even if he's got a license, it's got to be in that particular City.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael Wilson): Yes, definitely.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): You all agree with that?\n\nJudge: You all agree with that?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I completely agree with that.\n\nJudge: Okay, good, good, good. Good. Going inside the courtroom. Did you ever talk to the gas company to try to work it out and ask them what the heck?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I was never asked to.\n\nJudge: He, no, that's not my question. You have a dispute with him. Was he nasty?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): I don’t want to say anything bad.\n\nJudge: Okay, but is that why you didn’t go the, you know, take the trouble to make a phone call?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): What happened was he called me some two weeks later and said, I need a permit for this and I said, oh I’ll have to get my license of Babylon renewed.\n\nJudge: Wait, when you say a permit?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): He said I needed a permit that we had to get inspected from the village. That's what he told me, and I said, I can, of course, I can do that for you, but you have to charge you more money 'cause the job...\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): What the permit be for the job was already... you need a per... what I never understood about the thing, he said he needed a permit from the Town of Babylon.\n\nJudge: You didn’t need a permit from the Town of Babylon. The gas company didn’t tell me anything like that afterwards.\n\nJudge: No. The gas company just said, you know, he's not licensed in the Town of Babylon.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything in writing from the gas company?\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): No.\n\nJudge: Okay. For $100 you could have gotten your reciprocal license and solved this problem. Instead, you came here.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): No, $100 would have got my license, I still would have had to file a permit to complete his job.\n\nDefendant (Kenneth Deuchi): ‘Cause it turns out that’s what he told me he needed, a permit.\n\nJudge: But you don’t know because you never bothered to speak to the gas company.\n\nJudge: You know what? Return the guy’s money, $591.97. Verdict for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting Deflection Evasion"}
{"id": "78", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the defendant, Ronnie Johnson. He says there was no formal agreement about rent, but now that the plaintiff knows he collected a good chunk of money from his car accident, he's got his hand out. The plaintiff has a gambling problem, he needs to cover his losses, and he’s sorry, but he isn’t the plaintiff's personal piggy bank. He’s accused of failing a friend.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: these former friends are in court because the plaintiff says that the defendant was a freeloader who didn't pay rent, came into money, and then didn’t give him anything. But the defendant says there was no agreement to pay rent. It’s the case of \"It Ain’t Free.\"\n\nDaryl Buck, you are suing Ronnie Johnson, your former best friend, for $4,160 that you feel he owes you and refuses to pay. Correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: Ronnie and I were best friends for a good 12, 13 years. We were always together. Then he had a car accident, and I picked him up and took him to surgery twice.\n\nJudge: As a result of the car accident?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And he had to get out of his apartment for—I don’t know why—and he calls me and says, \"Daryl, I need a place to stay.\"\n\nJudge: Were you getting evicted?\n\nDefendant: I wasn’t working, I had no income.\n\nJudge: So that’s a yes?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, he needs a place to stay. And then what?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I have a second bedroom. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath condo in Pompano Beach, and the second bedroom was open. It has a sofa bed in there, and I was expecting him to stay in there. But he came in and just crashed on my couch. Five minutes later, our mutual friend, English Rick, came over with boxes and stuff—furniture and knickknacks—that the moving company never picked up from Ronnie’s place. And they put all that in my second bedroom, which I thought he would stay in.\n\nJudge: Well, why didn’t you set some ground rules? Why didn’t you tell him, \"You stay in the second bedroom and get a storage unit?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know it was happening.\n\nJudge: Well, I know, but when you saw it happening, why didn’t you just say to him, \"Listen, I don’t live this way. I don’t want to live among all this stuff. You get a storage room, and you can stay in my second bedroom?\" Why didn’t you just do that?\n\nPlaintiff: I, uh, I didn’t think of it.\n\nJudge: Okay. So now you’re living with him for a year and a half almost?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: During that time, was there any agreement between the two of you that he was going to pay?\n\nPlaintiff: The first six months, he was kind of rehabbing from his back, and he said, \"Daryl, don’t worry about it. You’re my best friend. Without you, I’d be on the street. Thanks for taking up all your space for me. I owe you. When I get my settlement, I’m going to take care of you.\"\n\nJudge: \"Very well\"?\n\nPlaintiff: \"Very well.\"\n\nJudge: Which means what?\n\nPlaintiff: He figured it was around $10,000–$12,000.\n\nJudge: How do you figure that?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s what Ronnie was telling me.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, in January, you tell him he has to start paying, and he does pay to live there, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he did.\n\nJudge: You asked him for $400 a month, and that’s what he started paying?\n\nPlaintiff: We agreed.\n\nJudge: And according to him, you made him promises that you would pay him part of your settlement. Was there ever an amount specified?\n\nDefendant: No, there was no amount specified. I didn’t even know how much my settlement was going to be. I originally thought it would be around $670,000, but it ended up only being $200,000.\n\nJudge: But all those other months before January, did you tell him, \"I’m going to take care of you. You’re my best friend?\"\n\nDefendant: I may have said something like that, but there was no contract.\n\nJudge: So what happened? How did this friendship end?\n\nDefendant: He locked me out. I had to go to the doctor, get new prescriptions, buy new clothes, and stay in hotels for 20 days until my condo opened up.\n\nJudge: Why did you lock him out?\n\nPlaintiff: He was falling into bushes, and people in my condo had to pick him up and carry him inside. I told him, \"Ron, you gotta stop this drinking.\"\n\nJudge: So you changed the locks?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You can’t do that. If someone is paying rent, they’re a tenant, and you have to go through the proper eviction process.\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t know where he was, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t change the law. You should have taken him to court for eviction.\n\nPlaintiff: I have affidavits from people in my condo who saw him passed out in the bushes.\n\nJudge: I’ll read them, but this isn’t a contract. I find in favor of the defendant.\n\n[Music]\n\nJudge: I’m kind of sad that a 12-year friendship is over because of what he feels is a lack of gratitude on your part.

{"id": "216", "dialogue": "Judge: Tisia Ingram, you're suing Sharice Caldwell, your dear old friend as you called her, for two trips that she took that you organized as well as a skirt she won't return. What happened? How long have you two known each other?\n\nPlaintiff: Approximately 13 years.\n\nJudge: Wow. Okay, and what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Over the course of our relationship, we've had a very rocky friendship with borrowing and loaning and being there for each other. Just so happens last year, I gave several bus trips, and she—\n\nJudge: What do you mean by you gave several bus trips?\n\nPlaintiff: I give bus trips. We go—\n\nJudge: You said \"give,\" but do you mean \"organize?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I organize bus trips where we go to different amusement parks, food eateries, things like that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I gave three bus trips last year, and she agreed to go on two of them, bringing her family.\n\nJudge: And according to you, the price of the first one that she owes is $365?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: And she went on that one? Did she have family members on that one?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the price of the second one was $255?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And did she have family members on that one?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so she owes you $620, and she's never paid a penny of it. When was the first trip?\n\nPlaintiff: The first trip was June 17, 2017.\n\nJudge: And the second one?\n\nPlaintiff: August 12, 2017.\n\nJudge: And so what's happened between then and now? What kind of discussions have the two of you had about this?\n\nPlaintiff: We've had verbal discussions, we've had telephone discussions, and even text messaging in regards to the money owed. We've even done a payment plan.\n\nJudge: If you said that you had a rocky relationship with her in terms of borrowing and lending, why is it that you loaned—why did you front the money for the trip for her anyway?\n\nPlaintiff: She's a friend. We've done things for each other. We've been there for each other.\n\nJudge: So the fact that you've had a rocky relationship in exactly this kind of situation wasn't a red flag? That if you wanted to keep your friend, rather than have to sue her, perhaps you guys shouldn't engage in this kind of behavior of borrowing and lending?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: What are you nodding about? You're the one who borrowed.\n\nDefendant: Okay, well, let's talk about the trips.\n\nJudge: What do you say these trips were?\n\nDefendant: Okay, basically, I'm here, Your Honor, because I didn’t say yes to the dress.\n\nJudge: We’re going to get back to that later.\n\nDefendant: This is the dress—this is my daughter's prom dress.\n\nJudge: Prom dress?\n\nDefendant: Yes, this is the reason why I’m here.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: This is the dress—this is why I’m here. Because I didn’t say yes to this dress. I did not ask to go on these trips with Miss Ingram. Miss Ingram begged me to go on these trips. Miss Ingram doesn’t get along with a lot of her family members, and she begged me to go.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, are you suggesting that she put a gun to your head and made you incur this debt?\n\nDefendant: No. That’s my friend.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you’re supposed to pay her back, right?\n\nDefendant: No, she told me that—please go because I can then pay her whenever.\n\nJudge: Okay, so the idea, though, is not that she's going to fund your trip. You're supposed to pay her whenever you can?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you're supposed to pay.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So you made a decision to go on the trip knowing that you would have to pay at some point?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: When is \"some point\"? How many years have to pass before \"some point\" is ripe?\n\nDefendant: Well, Miss Ingram knew of my ailments. One being, now, I just had surgery. I haven’t worked.\n\nJudge: When you look at a judge and you say, \"I'm not working,\" do you think that's a defense? It’s not a defense.\n\nDefendant: I told Miss Ingram in the beginning that I could not afford the trips. I told her I couldn’t afford it.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you still went.\n\nDefendant: She begged me to go. She asked me to recruit my mom. She asked me to recruit my friend. And they also can be witnesses to her saying that I can pay her whenever.\n\nJudge: We’re going to go with your version—you can pay her whenever. The problem is, when you two enter into an arrangement like this, and there is no clear deadline, it becomes my job as a judge to determine what is reasonable. And a year is past reasonable.\n\nDefendant: But I haven't been working!\n\nJudge: I don't care. Go get a job. You seem very able-bodied.\n\nDefendant: I haven't worked in a year.\n\nJudge: That is a \"you\" problem, not a \"me\" problem. A year, not a month, not a day, not a week. A year! That is a \"you\" problem.\n\nDefendant: I have zero.\n\nJudge: I don’t care! You still can’t figure out how to pay 20 bucks? Would we be here if you had been paying her a little bit here and there?\n\nPlaintiff: Of course not.\n\nJudge: Your total sum of payment is zero.\n\nDefendant: She never asked me for it.\n\nJudge: Don't talk. You don’t look good in this. Shut your mouth very soon. Verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $620. And you still have the skirt.\n\nDefendant: That’s because it was due whenever.

{"id": "453", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Vet Ramos. She says she gave the defendant an advance on his salary because he was having some financial difficulties, and boy, does she feel like a fool today. Almost immediately, the defendant stopped showing up for work. It was one excuse after another. He hasn’t returned the $1,500 she gave him, and she’s suing.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Ronaldo. He says the plaintiff gave him a personal check, not a company check, and said, \"Here, this is to help you out.\" He was very grateful. She never mentioned any type of cash advance, and he thought it was a gift. Then he got sick and couldn’t work for about a week, and boom—the plan changed. She demanded to be paid back, and he thinks this is all crazy because the money was always a gift. He’s accused of being ungrateful and untrustworthy.\n\nJudge: All parties, please be seated.\n\nJudge: [To clerk] Have the litigants been sworn?\n\nClerk: Yes, your honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Ms. Ramos, you are the executive director of Hope Central Incorporated. You’re suing Ronaldo, and you’ve asked us not to mention your last name, for $1,500 that you had given him as a job advance, and he never showed up to work, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. What is Hope Central Incorporated?\n\nPlaintiff: We are a re-entry program for ex-offenders.\n\nJudge: What propelled you to form this re-entry service?\n\nPlaintiff: I was in jail when I was younger, and I wound up getting into trouble and stuff. I turned my life around. I gave my life to Christ, and I’ve been healed and saved ever since.\n\nJudge: So you felt that you wanted to give back?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what is it that you do for inmates that are being released?\n\nPlaintiff: Case management. We try to get them back on their feet to work and become stable.\n\nJudge: So you coach them in how to get a job, how to open up an account, and how to try to become productive members of society and be independent.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So what happened? How did you end up meeting Ronaldo?\n\nPlaintiff: A friend of mine knows him and introduced us.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: Thinking he might be able to help us because I was looking for another case manager.\n\nJudge: So you spoke to him on the phone and then went to his house?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I noticed that he needed a little help. He told me he was in the hospital and things like that, but that he’s dealt with people that have been ex-cons.\n\nJudge: So he tells you that he was in law enforcement, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you feel like that’s a good idea?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, because I deal with a lot of different felonies. So I was interested in hiring him, and I explained to him what we do. He asked me what we do, what he needs to learn, and everything like that.\n\nJudge: Did he sound enthusiastic?\n\nPlaintiff: He did. He sounded enthusiastic and everything. And right there, I felt, \"Well, let me give him the money so that he can get himself in order.\"\n\nJudge: Now, the money didn’t come from Hope Central?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it did.\n\nJudge: But it was your personal check, right?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it wasn’t a personal check.\n\nJudge: [To defendant] You say it was a personal check?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Can I see the check?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have the check, but I have the bank records.\n\nJudge: That’ll do.\n\nJudge: Either way, did you say anything when you gave him the money?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What did you say?\n\nPlaintiff: I explained to him everything that he needed to do. I brought my laptop over, showed him all the forms and everything that needed to be done. He said he could handle that, he could do that, and our friend was sitting in the living room.\n\nJudge: Do you have internet access to this account?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Can you get that up on your phone?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: The date of this is December 15th. According to you, you’re telling him all about the job and what will be expected of him, and you tell him when you’re giving him this check for $1,500—do you tell him why you’re giving it to him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I tell him I would pay him one month in advance because I pay bi-monthly. So I told him I would pay him the one month in advance and that he would start in January.\n\nJudge: And when January comes along, do you start working?\n\nDefendant: No. The first week I was supposed to start work, I got sick. I had diarrhea and vomiting the whole week.\n\nJudge: Did you call?\n\nDefendant: I left a message a couple of times.\n\nJudge: Who did you leave a message with?\n\nDefendant: To her and my friend.\n\nJudge: Do you have any proof that you left a message?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: [To plaintiff] According to you, he never even showed up, didn’t call, didn’t do anything?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he didn’t show. I mean, I went to his home because I noticed that he was very irresponsible. So I went to his home and told him, \"I don’t think this is going to work out.\"\n\nJudge: [To defendant] What did you do with the money? You had a good Christmas?\n\nDefendant: I used it for my house, my stuff.\n\nJudge: Why haven’t you paid it back?\n\nDefendant: I told her that I would pay it back.\n\nJudge: Telling someone you’ll pay it back and actually paying it back are two different things. She can’t take your little thought cloud, deposit it, and write checks against it.\n\nJudge: [To plaintiff] Do you have the bank statement?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have it up.\n\nJudge: [To defendant] You haven’t paid it back?\n\nDefendant: No, because I was in the hospital for four months. I was struggling.\n\nJudge: There’s always a reason you’re struggling. That’s who you are.\n\nDefendant: I never disappeared. She knows where I live.\n\nJudge: Not that it matters, but this is a Hope Central check that she paid you. It couldn’t be clearer—you’re lying when you say it was a personal check.\n\nJudge: You couldn’t be more ungrateful and more not worth helping. She’s busy doing God’s work, helping the people no one else wants to help. She tries to give you a chance to stop struggling, and you steal her money.\n\nJudge: I don’t see how there’s any other way to look at it.

All right, so talk to me. How long did you live there?\n\nPlaintiff: I lived there for approximately two and a half years.\n\nJudge: And when you left, why did you leave?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, they asked me to.\n\nJudge: Alright, this is a place that you decided you were going to move back into?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright, so you didn't renew her lease?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, now, according to you, you guys sent out a check, then you realized you had the wrong amount for the security deposit and sent out another check. But the bottom line is, the checks you sent to her... there's two checks and they total how much?\n\nDefendant: One check was for $521 and the other one was for $450.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you sent her a total of $971.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright, which means that you kept $479 of her security deposit. Why?\n\nDefendant: There was a past due water bill for $171.\n\nJudge: Can I see the water bill?\n\nPlaintiff: Do you deny that you owe the water bill?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct, I do not. The water bill wasn’t in my name.\n\nDefendant: Who had been paying the water bill?\n\nPlaintiff: I had been paying the water bill.\n\nJudge: Okay, then you know you're supposed to pay it. It may not be in your name, but if your agreement with him is that you're supposed to pay the water you use, then you're supposed to pay the water bill.\n\nDefendant: What else did you keep her deposit for?\n\nDefendant: There was a grass cutting fee for $35.\n\nPlaintiff: Were you responsible for maintaining the grass?\n\nDefendant: I did tell them that I would be responsible for maintaining the yard.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nDefendant: Locksmith of $95.\n\nJudge: Well, what happened with that?\n\nDefendant: Did you guys do a walkthrough?\n\nPlaintiff: She changed the locks. She was supposed to be out on May 31st. When my wife went over there on June 1st, the locks were changed.\n\nJudge: Okay, so had there been any discussion about transferring the keys and stuff?\n\nDefendant: There was a discussion prior to us going over there around middle of May. She had a request on our app for me to come and fix a water leak. I went in, fixed the water leak. Prior to me leaving, I told her just leave the garage door openers and the keys on the island, and that would be it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so at some point, I think she was demanding a walkthrough, and you called the police. What happened?\n\nDefendant: Police came. They basically said, you know, we’re here to keep the peace. What’s going on? I told them I was in the process of moving out of the home, and all I wanted to do was have a walkthrough. At the time, the officer said, well, let us go out here and ask them if they’ll give a walkthrough. The defendant basically said no, we’re not giving a walkthrough. So the police said, okay, if you’re not going to give her a walkthrough, then you need to leave, and she can stay because legally you have to evict her to make her leave here. You did not evict her, you asked her to leave.\n\nPlaintiff: And so, if they were not going to give me a walkthrough, I was not going to leave because I did not damage their home. I left that home in immaculate condition. And so, they finally agreed after a short time, about an hour later, they finally agreed to do the walkthrough. They did the walkthrough. The defendant signed for the keys, garage door opener, and the items that I left in the home, which he stated he wanted left at the time of the notice on the 60-day notice.\n\nJudge: Okay, you lived there for two and a half years. Was it mostly okay, or was it always kind of testy?\n\nPlaintiff: Every month, there was always something. When she first moved there, there were issues.\n\nJudge: Listen, we have the water bill. We’ve talked about it. Do you have a list that you may have sent to her, telling her, I’m keeping this and this, and this is why I feel I have a right to keep it?\n\nDefendant: Alright, let me go over that. So, can I add something to this?\n\nPlaintiff: Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so it wouldn’t do me any justice to stand here and lie. These were great people. Great, like, they came, anything that I asked for, they did. Valentine’s Day, they came and put flowers on my porch. Anything that I had really asked for, they really did. We shared scriptures back and forth throughout this time. All of a sudden, it went haywire.\n\nJudge: Do you know when it went haywire?\n\nPlaintiff: It went haywire sometime around about a year and a half into my time in the home.\n\nJudge: Can you pinpoint what the reason was, or what do you think it was?\n\nPlaintiff: It was so many things that led up to it.\n\nJudge: So, you feel like you had legitimate concerns every month, you know, and that they felt that you were just whining too much or something, and that they were sick of you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What is this a picture of?\n\nPlaintiff: These are pictures that you took to justify keeping some of the security deposit.\n\nJudge: What is that?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s just dog hair and all of the vents that we had to clean out. And then this is the grass.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you kept $35 for that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Alright, what’s that?\n\nPlaintiff: That is the old doorbell camera that she took.\n\nJudge: Let’s talk about that part. A huge part of your lawsuit has to do with an alarm bill for $3,773.58. What on Earth is that?\n\nPlaintiff: When I moved into the home, this alarm system that’s on this table right here was in the home.\n\nJudge: Okay, so why is it on your side of the table if it belongs to the home?\n\nPlaintiff: Because they sent me a bill for $3,785.\n\nJudge: Who did?\n\nPlaintiff: Vivid alarm system.\n\nJudge: Okay, whose alarm system is it?\n\nPlaintiff: It was in the home when I moved in.\n\nJudge: Okay, they sent you a bill because you took the alarm system with you when you moved out?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they sent me a bill because when I moved into the home, they said, “We have an alarm system here, but would you like to have it activated?” I said, “Oh yeah, fine.” Got the alarm system activated. I was receiving a bill every month for about $69 to $70, which I gave them. And so, I called the alarm company like October, November. I said, \"I do not want this alarm system. What can I do?\" They said, “Well, have you signed a contract with them?” I said, “I did.”\n\nJudge: For how long?\n\nPlaintiff: I was under an assumption I was only signing…\n\nJudge: Do you have the contract she signed with the alarm company?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have the contract that she signed, but I do have an email from the company saying when we end it.\n\nJudge: So, why did they have to pay the bill?\n\nPlaintiff: I assumed a monthly amount for service.\n\nJudge: Right, but the bill was in your name.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.

{"id": "628", "dialogue": "**[Judge]**: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Irene Chabior. You are suing Paul Pedroza for $2,200, a refund of the price of a fence that you paid him to put in that didn’t last very long, according to you. What happened?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: Well, on November 21st, I called Cape Cod Fence Company because I wanted a fence. They said, ‘Oh, my boss is going to call you.’ Two days later, he called me back and said that it was a small job, so the boss wasn’t going to take it. He said he could install the fence for me on the side because he said they didn’t have much work, they sent him home, and he needed money. So I said okay, come to my house, I’m going to show you what I want, and you’re going to tell me how much it’s going to cost me. So he came over with his cousin and looked at it. He said, ‘Why don’t you get a vinyl fence?’ I said okay. I said, ‘Vinyl is expensive.’ He goes, ‘No, vinyl went down, and you can get good vinyl at a decent price, a little bit more money than cedar.’ So I agreed. He gave me a $2,200 price for the fence with no removal.\n\n**[Judge]**: Why are you laughing?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: I’m nervous.\n\n**[Judge]**: Get her some water, will you? Okay, go ahead.\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: He even told me it was going to be a much better fence than my neighbor has, and my neighbor has had their fence for 15 years. So I said okay, I like the vinyl fence. He said, ‘When we do vinyl, we cement the posts, and it has a lifetime warranty.’ So we signed a contract, and we agreed that I was going to give him $1,100 as a deposit.\n\n**[Judge]**: Can I see the contract?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: Yes.\n\n**[Judge]**: So you did give him $1,100 as a deposit, right, and he’s supposed to get the fence. Oh my goodness, just a little—okay. That’s the contract? Just kind of a blank receipt?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: Yes. And then he agreed that in case anything went wrong, he would come and fix it due to weather.\n\n**[Judge]**: Yes, she says you wrote on the back maybe?\n\n**[Defendant]**: Yes, I did.\n\n**[Judge]**: That sound familiar?\n\n**[Defendant]**: My thing is, I usually tamp the posts—\n\n**[Judge]**: Wait, wait. But what were you going to say? ‘I didn’t guarantee it, so the heck with her?’ By the way, what happens two weeks later?\n\n**[Plaintiff]**: A little bit of wind. I get up in the morning, I look outside, and I see my fence going back and forth. I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was early. I put my glasses on, I’m watching my fence. I call him—no answer. So I look again, after breakfast, everything fell apart. I called him again. I said, ‘You know, the fence is all over.’ He never called me back. Then I knew he was not going to come and fix it.\n\n**[Judge]**: And what do you have to say, sir?\n\n**[Defendant]**: She picked Home Depot fence! She wanted the cheaper option!\n\n**[Judge]**: That’s not the issue. The issue is the quality of the installation. If a new fence falls over in a normal windstorm, isn’t that evidence that it wasn’t installed properly?\n\n**[Defendant]**: No, we had 50-60 mph winds!\n\n**[Judge]**: No, you didn’t. I pulled the weather records. The highest recorded gust was 40 mph, and sustained winds were only 18 mph. It was not a hurricane!\n\n**[Defendant]**: She got what she paid for!\n\n**[Judge]**: No, she got a fence for a month. Do you think people pay $2,200 for a fence that lasts a month?\n\n**[Defendant]**: She should have picked better materials.\n\n**[Judge]**: Then you should have refused the job! If you knew the materials were bad, why take her money?\n\n**[Defendant]**: My boss knew.\n\n**[Judge]**: Did your boss know you were doing side jobs like this?\n\n**[Defendant]**: Yeah, he knows everything.\n\n**[Judge]**: Were you fired?\n\n**[Defendant]**: No, this is the only complaint I’ve ever had.\n\n**[Judge]**: You said you’d fix it. Did you?\n\n**[Defendant]**: My phone was lost, so I shut it off.\n\n**[Judge]**: That’s ridiculous. Pay the lady back.

He’s the owner of the car, but I was the one driving.\n\nJudge: All right. You are suing for $1,422, um, the defendant, because according to you, she damaged your car by hitting a motorcycle, which then landed on your car. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so on June 20th, I went to my doctor’s appointment. I parked my car on Casin Boulevard next to a Starbucks, left my car, went to my doctor’s appointment, came back maybe 20 minutes later—well, I was only about a half an hour, hour. I came back and I was on the phone with my girlfriend. I see Starbucks, which is fully windowed out. I see a whole bunch of people waving their arms, and I didn’t think it was me. So, I closed the door, and a young kid, 16 or 17 years old, knocked on my window. I said to my girlfriend, “Let me call you back.” I opened the door, and he was like, “The motorcycle is on your hood.” And I said, “Oh God!” It was actually on my hood, the handlebars were on the right side of my car.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it was indenting. Did you take a picture?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have pictures.\n\nJudge: Let me see it.\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, goodness.\n\nJudge: And you hadn’t noticed it when you got in the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t notice it. I came from behind. Maybe that’s why. And I didn’t realize it was in my car. I didn’t think about it. You know, bikes are also on a tilt. I didn’t realize it was in my car. Plus, I didn’t notice it when I turned the key. Honestly, I didn’t notice it right away.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s go over this a second. So, when they called your attention to it, you actually got out of the car and saw that the motorcycle was leaning into your car at that moment. Did the motorcycle person come after you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, there was no damage to his motorcycle.\n\nJudge: So, what happens? When do you meet up with the defendant?\n\nPlaintiff: So, they said to me, “We saw the Sentra.” There was a nice lady who came out, and she was my witness. She wrote for me. She had noticed Isabelle was trying to get into the spot. As she was parallel parking, it was clearly a tight spot, and they saw her bump it. It fell onto my car. They told her, and she tried to act like she didn’t know. They said to her, “We’re going to take down your plate.” She said, “Okay, I’ll pay for it.” I come back about 10 minutes later. When she showed up, she was walking slowly, and she said, “I’m so sorry. I tried very carefully to park, and I understand accidents happen.”\n\nPlaintiff: I told Isabelle that I’ve had an incident like this before and didn’t get paid for the damage, so I’m still going to call 911. It was really hot that day. She invited me into Starbucks and bought me an iced coffee, and I started feeling really bad. So I called my brother and said, “Should I forget about the cops and just take her information?” My brother said, “No, you won’t get paid.” So I called 911.\n\nPlaintiff: The police never came, but two officers happened to pull across the street. I asked them to come over. They were so nice and did. She proceeds to tell the officer that she would pay for the damage, and the officer said there was no reason to make a report.\n\nJudge: Did you hit the motorcycle?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Thank you. And now we have a reason to write the report.\n\nPlaintiff: She told the officer she would pay, but it’s not happening now.\n\nJudge: Ms. Suie, what happened?\n\nDefendant: Well, that whole thing was really funny. I didn’t hit the motorcycle. That day, I was in a rush. I was just looking for a parking spot. I saw a motorcycle in the way, and I was careful not to hit it. I parked carefully. Then I thought, “Great, I made it!” Then the motorcycle fell onto her car.\n\nDefendant: I ran to the grocery store. I picked up something for my husband and went home. I didn’t talk to anyone. I didn’t know about the accident until I was told.\n\nJudge: Why did you take her for iced coffee then?\n\nDefendant: Because I felt bad for her. I didn’t know what had happened.\n\nJudge: So you’re admitting you didn’t hit the motorcycle but still apologized?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say, “I didn’t hit your motorcycle”?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn’t say that. I did apologize, though.\n\nPlaintiff: This is my witness statement. I was in Starbucks when I saw a woman driving a silver Sentra parallel parking. As she reversed into the parking spot, she hit the motorcycle, which then fell onto the hood of the car. I gathered my belongings and approached Jacquelyn Garcia to inform her about the damage.\n\nJudge: Let me see all the estimates you have.\n\nPlaintiff: I have the estimate from Allstate when the adjuster came out. I called her insurance company, then I had the estimate from the body shop I went to.\n\nPlaintiff: So I called her before I went to the body shop, and she said she was okay with it. But when I got there, she didn’t want to pay.\n\nJudge: Did she ever say she’d pay?\n\nPlaintiff: She did not say she’d pay, but she did apologize.\n\nJudge: She didn’t want to deal with insurance?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. She said she would pay out of pocket, but later said she could only give me $400.\n\nJudge: And what did she say when you told her it was $1,300?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she could only give $400 because she was unemployed. But she didn’t want to pay.\n\nPlaintiff: So, I called Allstate. Allstate came out, but they denied my claim.\n\nJudge: Isabelle, you didn’t admit you hit the motorcycle?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: The Allstate adjuster said you admitted to hitting it, but you said you were afraid of getting hurt by the kids nearby.\n\nDefendant: I didn’t say that.\n\nJudge: You feel bullied by the kids?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know about the kids.\n\nJudge: I don’t believe you. I think you hit the motorcycle and tried to avoid responsibility. The kids didn’t bully you.

{"id": "131", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Erica Simmons. She says the defendant towed her car and in the process damaged the engine. Now the car’s totaled.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s right. They punctured the engine, and all the oil leaked out. Now they won’t take responsibility for their misdeeds and the horrible damage they caused.\n\nJudge: She’s suing for $5,000, the value of her now worthless car. These are the defendants, Heather and Vincent.\n\nDefendant (Heather): The plaintiff’s a liar who’s trying to get one over on us because she’s mad her car was towed.\n\nDefendant (Vincent): We flatbed the cars we tow. There’s no way we could puncture an oil pan, and even if we did, there’d be an engine full of oil on our brand-new tow truck. The state would be all over us for hazardous oil spills, for crying out loud. Bottom line—we did nothing wrong and owe the plaintiff zero.\n\nJudge: All parties, please be seated. Welcome to court. Miss Simmons, your car was apparently left in the parking area of an apartment building for quite some time. It ended up getting towed, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: How long was it there?\n\nPlaintiff: It wasn’t that long.\n\nJudge: How long is “not that long”?\n\nPlaintiff: Like a week, because my apartment complex doesn’t allow cars to sit for more than a week if they’re not working.\n\nJudge: How do they know it’s not working?\n\nPlaintiff: They have people walk around and check for stickers. If you stay there, they put a decal on your car to make sure the tags are up to date.\n\nJudge: Was your tag up to date?\n\nPlaintiff: My car was fine. Everything was fine. It was up to date.\n\nJudge: Then how would they know it had been sitting there?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: What was the reason given to you for the tow?\n\nDefendant (Heather): The apartment complex called us and said they had an unregistered vehicle with expired registration. The registration had been out of date since February 2018, and this was November 27, 2018.\n\nJudge: Did they tell you how long the car had been sitting there?\n\nDefendant (Heather): No, they don’t indicate that.\n\nJudge: So you’re assuming it had been sitting there since February, but it might not have been?\n\nDefendant (Vincent): It might have been driving around with an expired tag.\n\nJudge: Did you ever ask the apartment building why they towed your car?\n\nPlaintiff: I did. I told them it had only been four days. I had taken my tag off my window because someone had stolen my tag before, so I put it inside my car.\n\nJudge: You put your entire license plate inside your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, because I locked my doors.\n\nJudge: They asked you to tow it. How did you tow it?\n\nDefendant (Vincent): The car was backed into a parking space, so we sent a rollback carrier. The car is attached with two chains and pulled onto the carrier. There’s no way anything could touch the oil pan.\n\nJudge: What happened when you went to pick up the car?\n\nPlaintiff: It wouldn’t start. Normally, it cranks up. The only thing wrong before was my crankshaft sensor. But when I tried to drive it, nothing happened. I had to get it towed to a shop, and they said the oil pan had a hole in it.\n\nJudge: What evidence do you have that the tow caused the hole?\n\nPlaintiff: My mechanic said it was hit by heavy force impact. I have pictures.\n\nDefendant (Heather): She called us, and we told her the apartment complex ordered the tow. She needed current registration.\n\nJudge: Did she have a title?\n\nDefendant (Vincent): Yes.\n\nJudge: So she got the car out, took it to a mechanic, and then claimed there was damage. But you say the tow could not have caused it?\n\nDefendant (Heather): Correct.\n\nJudge: Miss Simmons, your car had not been registered since February. Can you prove it was registered between February and November?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have my registration with me.\n\nJudge: If you had no registration, that tells me the car wasn’t driven.\n\nPlaintiff: I was driving my car.\n\nJudge: Did you call them the day it was towed?\n\nDefendant (Heather): Yes, she called upset.\n\nJudge: Why are you suing for $5,000?\n\nPlaintiff: My car is totaled.\n\nJudge: How do you determine it’s worth $5,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Blue Book value.\n\nJudge: But your car had mechanical problems.\n\nPlaintiff: Pain and suffering.\n\nJudge: Based on what I’m hearing, this damage could not have been caused by the tow. You haven’t proven they caused it. My verdict is for the defendants.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s fine.

{"id": "558", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please welcome back to the People's Court. The plaintiff says he took his car to the car wash, told them not to brush the rims, but they did it anyway and wrecked up his Mercedes. Now, the defendant says the rims were already oxidized. It's the case of oxidizer he hardly knew her.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Doug. Nobody wants their last name or their company names. Stephen, you're suing Michael's car wash business for $570.28, a cost that you will have to pay to refurbish three rims that you say are ruined thanks to his employees' negligence. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, Your Honor. I go to the same car wash all the time since they opened. I went there on March 1st, got there about 5 p.m. When you go into this car wash before you go through the mechanized brushing and everything, you get out of your car, and the workers take long brushes on the end of sticks and do like a pre-going-over of the car. Every time I go, I tell them not to do that, and they always listen to me.\n\nJudge: How many years have you been going there?\n\nPlaintiff: Five. I might have been going there before the defendant actually took over the business.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I have aluminum alloy rims. They're very, very susceptible to being scratched, and they always listen. They never use brushes because even if the brushes are very soft, debris from previous cars gets on the brushes. Sometimes the workers will stand the brush up when they're not using it, and debris from the ground gets on the brushes. So now my car goes through. I never want them to do that. They always listen.\n\nPlaintiff: I get there this day, I tell them in English and Spanish because I think one or two of them may speak Spanish as their primary language. So I tell them in both languages, \"Please don't use brushes.\" And they say, \"Very well, we won't.\"\n\nPlaintiff: I'm looking at some of the products that are sold there. I turn around, and they're using brushes—not on the body, but on the rims. So I said, \"Oh, hold up, please.\" They said, \"We're not doing it on the body, we're only doing it on the rims.\" I said, \"We can't have it on the rims.\"\n\nPlaintiff: I stopped them before they got to the fourth wheel. It goes through the mechanism, and we get out to the other end. After they dry everything, I notice the rims are obviously marked with brush marks—very, very obviously with brush marks.\n\nJudge: Do you have photos?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor. I wanted to speak to the owner, but I actually saw the owner leave. I got there at 5:06 according to my receipt. He left maybe ten minutes before that. I saw him leave with somebody else.\n\nJudge: So it wasn’t possible for you to speak with him?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. As my car was being done, I observed the owner leaving for the day with someone else. So I wasn't able to speak to him that day. I did bring it to the attention of the cashier.\n\nJudge: What's the cashier's name?\n\nPlaintiff: I don't remember.\n\nJudge: Did you take any pictures on the spot?\n\nPlaintiff: I took pictures the next—\n\nJudge: No, but did your employee tell you there was a problem yesterday? Did anybody tell you that there had been an issue?\n\nDefendant: No, I found out there was an issue after I received the complaint.\n\nJudge: Do you have the pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n[Conversation continues with both sides presenting their arguments.]\n\nJudge: I don't know how these scratches got there. They're very deep and very embedded. I don’t know that a brush could do this. The problem that you have when you come into court is that you have to be able to prove your case by a preponderance of the evidence. That means that you have to prove to me it happened the way you're saying it happened.\n\nJudge: One of the greatest detriments to your case is the lack of any evidence that you immediately and on the spot reported it, as opposed to coming back later. I just don’t see how a brush touching your wheels would do this extensive an amount of damage and not damage every single car that goes through there.\n\nJudge: I just don’t—despite the fact that you brought me a picture with debris on the bottom of your brush today—this just doesn’t look to me like brush marks. I could be wrong, but you’re the one who has to prove it to me that it happened on that spot. So my verdict in this case, because I find that you haven’t proven it, is for the defendant.

She says the defendant pushed her way into living in her home, brought her boyfriend in to live with her too, then, to top things off, stole her snowblower. She thought the defendant was her friend, but it turns out she's nothing but a user, and she's here suing her for the $1,500 it's going to cost her to buy a new snowblower.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Nini Singh. She says she purchased a used Honda snowblower from the plaintiff, paid her 500 bucks in cash, and has a receipt to prove it. The plaintiff blames her for being fired from the job they worked at. She's so happy now they're no longer friends.\n\nJudge: She's accused of blowing a friendship.\n\nBailiff: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says the defendant strong-armed her way into living with the plaintiff at her house, then had the nerve to steal her snowblower. The defendant says the plaintiff sold it. It's the case of \"You Dirty Snowblower.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Thees Ganesan?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing Nalani Singh for $1,500, the cost of a snowblower that, according to you, she has kept from you. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: It's not going to be the cost of the snowblower, but I'm asking for compensation to get one in place. Uh, I purchased a snowblower in 2015.\n\nJudge: A used one?\n\nPlaintiff: A used one, okay. I got it for, I paid only $600, but it was an antique.\n\nJudge: Antique? Meaning how old was it?\n\nPlaintiff: A 2008 one, but the person who was selling it didn’t use it. He was going through a divorce and wanted to get rid of it immediately before his wife could get the money.\n\nJudge: Right, okay. So go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I thought she was my friend.\n\nJudge: How did you two know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: Through work. She was working in an independent handicap place, and she told me that I could come and work there. She got me the job. But I thought she was really getting me a job, but she was actually using me to cover her time off.\n\nJudge: Okay. You had said in your complaint that she was married and wanted to rent a room in your home, and you thought she was joking. Tell me about that.\n\nPlaintiff: While she was talking, she would say that she wanted to rent a room, she wanted a room, she wanted a room, because she knew that I have a house and I'm a widow.\n\nJudge: What did she want a room for?\n\nPlaintiff: She was saying that she has a boyfriend and wanted to bring her boyfriend.\n\nJudge: Is she married?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So she has a house with a husband that she's living in, and she wanted an apartment, according to you, so she could see her boyfriend?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: And then you—you said yes?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not say yes at all. But she is a person who, if she wants something, she gets it.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, so did you rent her a room?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not rent the room.\n\nJudge: Did she give you money for the room?\n\nPlaintiff: She gave me $100 for utilities.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: She ended up coming, took everything out of the room, and put her stuff there. She would just come and go.\n\nJudge: So she just pushed her way into your home?\n\nPlaintiff: She also brought her boyfriend there. I was not happy about it.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you call the police and say there's an intruder?\n\nPlaintiff: At that time, I was still...\n\nJudge: Alright. So, the snowblower—according to you, what happened with the snowblower?\n\nPlaintiff: She saw the snowblower there, and she wanted to take the snowblower to use it, because, according to her, the person who was plowing her snow went to jail and they couldn’t get somebody to do it.\n\nJudge: Did you sell her the snowblower?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Did you—?\n\nPlaintiff: She told me that she—she borrowed the snowblower.\n\nJudge: Okay. And were you charging her for borrowing the snowblower?\n\nPlaintiff: She told me that, to use it, she will give me something.\n\nJudge: What did she give you?\n\nPlaintiff: $250.\n\nJudge: While you were working?\n\nPlaintiff: She came, and she said, \"Sign this receipt, sign this receipt.\"\n\nJudge: Why did you sign?\n\nPlaintiff: I did sign it because she was interfering at work. I said, \"Get out.\" That's what I do. They come to me, they say, \"Sign this, sign this,\" and I say, \"Why are you coming to my workplace? I will see you later.\"\n\nJudge: So you signed something. What was it?\n\nPlaintiff: Something that you signed—what did it say?\n\nPlaintiff: To get her out of that place, I signed it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me see it.\n\nDefendant: Oh, you have a carbon copy of it.\n\nJudge: Okay. So the one that you signed was on top of that. She took that one and gave you the carbon.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: She hasn't returned it.\n\nJudge: And so you want her to buy you a $1,500 one?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: No, not that. Well, that's what you're doing. You're suing for $1,500.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, because I can't get the same kind now. And I asked her to return it.\n\nJudge: What's going on with the snowblower? First of all, would you like to respond about the love nest she says you had in her apartment?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I have known her for almost 10 years. We were friends. I thought—she’s older than me, I trusted her like a mother. I used to tell her all my problems, because my marriage is in problems.\n\nJudge: Did you get a room in her house?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, did you pay $100 in utilities?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay.

{"id": "181", "dialogue": "\n**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Linda Gomez. She says she found the defendants a perfect apartment. Their application was approved, but once they met the landlord, he discovered they lied on their application by stating they had no pets. He felt deceived, and the landlord canceled the contract, and they still owe her the $1,757 commission they agreed to pay. So she's suing.\n\n**Judge:** These are the defendants, Justin and Xandy. Justin says they told the landlord they would give their cat to Justin's grandparents, so it wasn't an issue. The landlord changed his mind and decided not to rent to them. Now the plaintiff thinks she should collect a commission. No way. They're accused of telling a feline fib.\n\n**Judge:** All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to *The People's Court*. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says she is an excellent real estate agent who found an apartment for the defendants, and now they're trying to stiff her on her commission. But the defendants say the landlord changed his mind about renting to them, and they don't owe this woman a penny. It's the case of *Broker? He hardly knew her!*\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas.\n\n**Court Clerk:** You're welcome.\n\n**Judge:** All right, Ms. Linda, you are suing Mr. Justin and Ms. Xandy for $1,757 in broker’s fees that you claim you are entitled to and that they refused to pay. Tell me about it. What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Good afternoon, Your Honor. I'm Linda Gomez. On April 21st, Justin reached out to me through email and text, very interested in seeing a unit on Beacon Street in Boston. The next day, I scheduled everything. We met; the property manager and landlord’s agent were there, and he and I conducted the showing. We worked through it. They loved it. It was a perfect location for them since it was a seven-minute walk from their new job, so it was a no-brainer. A few hours later, I sent all the paperwork required to have this apartment taken off the market, and they sent all the applications very promptly, very well filled out. I submitted them with their proof of income, credit reports, and all the applications and brokers' fee disclosure that they signed.\n\n**Judge:** When the landlord reviewed it, was everything fine? What went wrong?\n\n**Plaintiff:** When the lease was produced and Justin and his partner looked at it, they saw that there was a rule that no pets were allowed in the building. They came back to the landlord saying, \"Oh, we have a cat. What can we do?\"\n\n**Judge:** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Because the timing of stuff is important, and I'm getting confused. They put in an application. Did they mention that they have pets?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, zero. They actually wrote down zero pets.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Then you say it’s a done deal. They got the apartment, and they noticed in the lease—but they had already signed the lease?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, no. At that point, when they wanted the landlord to either change the rule about the pet or let them know what to do, the landlord felt like they lied on the application.\n\n**Judge:** So the landlord backed out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. The landlord said—\n\n**Judge:** And you feel that they still owe the broker’s fee even though the deal didn’t happen? You feel they still owe the broker’s fee because it’s their fault?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes! You shouldn’t lie on an application. If you have a cat, you have a cat. Give the landlord the opportunity to respond to that.\n\n**Judge:** How do you know that they weren’t going to just make other arrangements for the cat?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because the building association has a rule of no pets.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, let me hear from you, Mr. Justin and Ms. Xandy. Whoever wants to talk first—tell me what’s going on here.\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** Yeah, absolutely, I’ll go first. Everything she said up to this point is true and accurate. We went through everything, all the process. It got to the point where we were presented a lease, and they’re pretty standard. We knew going into Boston—Boston, roughly 20% of landlords allow cats, less than 9% allow dogs, and less than 1% allow big dogs. So we knew going in this could be an issue, so we made plans ahead of time with my grandfather, who’s had cats his whole life.\n\n**Judge:** So when you got the lease, it specifically said no pets allowed?\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** Yes, but also at the end, it said, \"Ask for written permission if applicable.\" So we thought, \"Okay, we already made these plans. We have a cat that we love. Why don’t we just try to ask him?\" We had a great Zoom interview. They loved us. Why don’t we just try to ask if he could allow a cat?\n\n**Judge:** But my understanding is that the landlord lives in the building and is allergic.\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** I believe they have three locations. I’m not sure if they lived there. They have a place in London, a place in New York, and—\n\n**Judge:** Okay, let’s get to what happened next.\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** We emailed them at 11 a.m. and decided to email the landlord directly. We asked, \"Listen, the lease says with written permission I could have a pet, so I’m asking you.\" The landlord responded, \"Absolutely not. I’m allergic to cats. That’s a deal-breaker.\"\n\n**Judge:** And then what do you say?\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** We immediately responded, \"Oh, we’re sorry to hear that. We made plans for our cat to stay with my grandparents.\"\n\n**Judge:** So they followed the rules. They tried to see if they could get permission. It might have been a yes, but it turned out to be a no. And they said, \"Oh, no problem. We’ve already made an arrangement.\" And then the landlord changed his mind. So why should they have to pay the broker’s fee?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Because the apartment was taken off the market!\n\n**Judge:** But they didn’t back out! The landlord backed out. You only get paid if the deal happens and they back out—not if the landlord backs out because he got a bad feeling. I don’t know what happened here, but what happened isn’t their fault. My verdict is for the defendants.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Can I speak—\n\n**Judge:** Unfortunately, the plaintiff does not prevail. Ms. Gomez, what are you thinking right now?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I feel the judge should have read my broker’s fee disclosure where it says that if the party is approved and a lease is produced, then the broker's fee is owed.\n\n**Judge:** The judge pointed out the deal never went through, though.\n\n**Defendant (Justin):** We found another apartment that allows our cat, and we’re happy about that.\n\n**Judge:** Well, all’s well that ends well.

Um he had a casting on there for a web series that he was doing a play and his perfume line so I submitted online submission of course. Um he sent me an email on the first saying that he would like to cast me um so I went to New York on the 3rd um I met him.\nJudge: You went to New York from where?\nPlaintiff: From Boston.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: So I did the audition um it was kind of like an improv audition um and then he let me know that you know for the cast members they would have to pay they would have to buy his his perfume and the proceeds would go to a charity.\nJudge: Cast members would have to buy his perfume?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Okay.\nPlaintiff: Um it was retail $50 we had to pay 40 so I signed a contract for that and also um...\nJudge: Where's the contract does a contract say something about the perfume?\nPlaintiff: Yes yes said artist agrees to purchase one bottle of night Jasmine perfumes.\nJudge: All right so go on.\nPlaintiff: Um so again I gave him $40 that day um then I went back to Boston I came back we started rehearsing everything everything was fine came...\nJudge: Well let's talk about your contract first.

stay anymore we discussed that through text messages I let him know we can discuss it during rehearsal so during rehearsal that day um we discussed like you know and he said that maybe he would be able to reimburse me for my hotel stays and my travel when I get my...\nJudge: Did you tell her that?\nDefendant: I told her that I would try to work something out where I could have her stay somewhere in New York she didn't want to stay with anybody that I suggested.\nJudge: Okay but did you ever say something about we didn't have a budget to pay her?\nDefendant: Well that's what I would think that's why I'm asking whether you I mean it's her choice to come from Boston to New York that's why I would find it strange for you to say that.\nJudge: Did you did you have to say that cuz she was going to quit on you or did...\nDefendant: No no she was making it seemed like she needed a place to stay because...\nJudge: So you were just offering friends to stay with as opposed to handing her cash for...\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: All right so go on.\nPlaintiff: So and then during the 13th of January things that's when things started getting a little weird and I became a little suspicious of the whole thing um we met at a Starbucks a Starbucks instead for rehearsal and that day of he was...\nJudge: I'm sorry you met at a Starbucks for rehearsal?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: So how are you going to rehearse in a Starbucks?\nPlaintiff: We rehearsed upstairs um there was like a room with a big table all the cast members were there.\nJudge: That's so they were around the table you didn't actually get up and do your stuff and perform so it was a table reading?\nPlaintiff: Okay go on um so that day previous to arrive he had text me asking me to bring him a bottle of red wine that his stomach was hurting and helped soothe his pain um he didn't feel like standing in lines I told him no um he asked me to front him $10 I said no so during that rehearsal he gets a phone call or whatever he gets and he has to step out for like I don't know maybe 30 minutes he comes back and he says something about somebody passing away or whatever and at the time obviously I was very sympathetic to it I didn't think anything of it um so after that rehearsal I felt bad so I did buy him a glass of wine.\nJudge: We went to you're suing for the glass of wine?\nPlaintiff: Yeah that's included in there too.\nJudge: Why you for the glass of wine if you felt bad and decided to buy somebody a glass of wine?\nPlaintiff: Because after everything happened and again as I continue further with things that have happened I realized that he was just completely scamming me.\nJudge: Okay um according to you you had 17 rehearsals?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: And he didn't pay you for any of them?\nPlaintiff: No he hasn't paid me for anything.\nJudge: Okay according to you you have transportation and hotel expenses according to you you quit when did you end up quitting?\nPlaintiff: Um I believe it was January 30th.\nJudge: Okay are there any text messages or emails or anything that document how you quit?\nPlaintiff: Um no it's just me and him going back and forth on the text.\nJudge: Yes and then?\nPlaintiff: I talking about what getting paid um getting paid he was talking about how I had a bad attitude um I was telling him how he was very unprofessional because how the argument started was he was saying um how do I plan to be a professional actress if I never get back to him and I told him that I was busy I always get back to you when I can was I was running around the city trying to find places to say I said I always get back to you when I can and that's how it started.\nPlaintiff: Okay but I was suspicious before that when we first got to the rehearsal location everything just seemed really shady and suspicious and I just kind of bush League like you just didn't see that it was...\nJudge: Where did you think you were performing like where was the performance going to be eventually?\nPlaintiff: At the place where we were rehearsing in restaurant the Italian restaurant on Madison Avenue.\nJudge: So it's not like you thought you were going to be on Broadway you understood that this was a low budget you know whatever according to you it was your first time your first gig in New York or whatever so you can handle the Italian restaurant but not the Starbucks like tell me.\nPlaintiff: I know I never said anything.\nJudge: I need to know why okay I need to know why you quit give me the reason why you quit.\nPlaintiff: Because I realized that this this whole thing him being unprofessional with me everything thing like I was completely stressed out like yes it was my decision to commute back and forth to New York and I and originally I would not be suing him.\nJudge: Your contract doesn't call for transportation or hotel so someone says I'll work with you that's that's not a contract that you can sue on you're suing for three well you don't cuz you're suing for $340 in transportation expenses 537 in hotel expenses and $348.15 in food expenses why would he have to pay that?\nPlaintiff: He wouldn't and that's the thing saying because after all of this after going back and forth with him there was even one point I said to him okay just give me my money back for the perfume.\nJudge: You did say that?\nPlaintiff: Yes in text messages.\nJudge: And I said and then he didn't so now you're angry so now you're throwing in Everything But the Kitchen. Did she quit or did she or did she or did you fire her?\nDefendant: Your honor she was terminated.\nJudge: Oh so you did fire her?\nDefendant: We were um we got kind of close we were hanging out friends so at the time when we were at Starbucks the restaurant had booked an event there that night and I still wanted to have my reading with my cast so that's why we was in Starbucks it wasn't like we was having rehearsals in Starbucks and I told her via text um I'm just going to have to let you go you don't have to come to rehearsal tonight you're terminated so I don't know where she thinks that she quit also the contract we never agreed to pay for rehearsals stage readings is a performance it's not you get paid every time we rehearse she they are she was well aware that we did not have a budget.\nJudge: But how do you pay for readings what your contract says and I did find that odd it says $25 for readings and the word rehearsal isn't even in there.\nDefendant: The stage reading is a ticketed it would be a ticketed event we charge for stage readings.\nJudge: Ah so there's a budget for it because people pay for tickets to see the stage reading?\nDefendant: Yes and I I did have advertisers.\nJudge: Nobody's buying tickets for the stage reading in the Starbucks though?\nDefendant: No there this we never had a stage reading.\nJudge: Okay if we were to have a stage reading she would that's the agreement so the Starbucks was a rehearsal and the other stuff at the Italian restaurant was also a rehearsal and you're not paying for rehearsals right and it's accurate that the contract doesn't say anything about rehearsals and um the about the wine somebody did die that day and everybody...\nJudge: Do you think really think you need to say anything about the wine?\nDefendant: Please cuz I tried to offer her the money back.\nJudge: Are you kidding me please stop all right so what about the photo shoot we didn't talk about the photo shoot according to you you were there 2 days for a photo shoot?\nPlaintiff: Yes um no we did a photo shoot for um the overall play and a photo shoot for his perfume.\nJudge: Okay and what so what about that she did two photo shoots and according to the contract you owe her 100 bucks 50 bucks for each photo shoot.\nDefendant: She told me to keep the money she just wants a refund for the fragrance.\nJudge: Boy you should have jumped at that cuz then we wouldn't be here you didn't give her the money for the fragrance what's the problem with giving her the money back for the fragrance you never gave it the fragrance right?\nDefendant: Because I was going to meet her the next day when she said it I wind up being in the hospital she sends me text oh I'm suing you you you I'm like I just got the I I can still meet up with you no it's too late I'm suing you so she the deal was off.\nJudge: Okay so are actors and actresses as a group generally flaky?\nDefendant: I think that it doesn't matter what your occupation is I think it matters on the individual person and if that person is a flaky person and they also have to be they also happen to be an actor and actress that's just unfortunate.\nJudge: That was a roundabout way of not answering are they flaky or not as a group just generally.\nDefendant: Yeah.\nJudge: You see how easy that was go inside the courtroom so you definitely owe her 40 cuz she never got her perfume you definitely owe her a 100 cuz we've established that and what is the remaining uh stuff food expenses a glass of wine no Hotel expenses Transportation expenses no so really the last thing we're at is rehearsal now his explanation is look the the table reading is a ticketed event where I actually have been to one of those where everybody's at a Podium a stage reading everybody's at a a Podium and they're doing it's actually kind of cool to watch um and so he would have a budget to pay you guys because that's it but it does not say a word about being paid for rehearsals did you have any stage readings?\nPlaintiff: So what I was told was that that was for rehearsals again I can't prove that because it was something verbal.\nJudge: So yeah I'm all about the contract and um if you're suing under a contract you can't come in here demanding to get paid the stuff that's not in the contract and neither rehearsal Transportation hotel or food expenses are in the contract so I am going to order the the payment of the $100 for the two photo shoots and $40 for the perfume for a sum total judgment in your favor not of $184 but of $140 that is my verdict good luck folks.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendent", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting, deflection"}
{"id": "457", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Mr. Sporza, you are suing Ron. You've asked us not to refer to your last name. Ron has brought a posse of people. You are suing for $2,573.59 that you say he owes you for all you are out regarding a lemon that he sold you. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Good day, Your Honor. I was referred to Ron because he had a truck for sale. In speaking with Ron, I believe he misrepresented the reliability of the truck. I did test drive it. I had some concerns. The price started at...\n\nJudge: What year truck was this?\n\nPlaintiff: It's a 1903 Chevy—2003 Chevy. I'm sorry. Did I say 1903?\n\nJudge: 2003 Chevy?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, a 2003 Chevy.\n\nJudge: So, it’s 15 years old. 162,000 miles. Did you have a mechanic look at it before you bought it?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, how did you know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: He is roommates with a friend of mine for 30 years.\n\nJudge: All right, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I did trust Ron when he expressed to me that he knew the vehicle, having worked on it for the company that owned it before, because he's in the automotive business. He stressed to me that he uses this mechanic that is really reliable and really knows his work. I drove it for just under 150 miles, and an oil coolant line blew, totally seizing the motor. Ron had stressed to me that he had changed the oil coolant line on the truck. Come to find out, there are two oil coolant lines. One is hidden underneath a total enclosure under the motor. Come to find out, the mechanic he had been using—who was supposed to come look at the truck when the oil line blew—had taken out a customer’s vehicle, smashed it, came back all bloody, and ended up in prison for some reason. I don’t know the exact reason why. This was all explained to me by Ron.\n\nSo, I feel that he used a very unscrupulous mechanic. Ron’s brother mentioned that when you change an oil coolant line, you should change both of them because they are a pair. He did not.\n\nJudge: Did you ever take the car to a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Even after it blew, you didn’t take it to a mechanic? Where’s the car now?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s in a driveway at my boss’s property.\n\nJudge: But you must have taken it to a mechanic who told you the engine was blown.\n\nPlaintiff: The defendant told me that.\n\nJudge: How does he know the engine’s blown?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he came and did the testing and figured out that it is blown.\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I do auto body work.\n\nJudge: Okay, we’re in court, and nobody has seen fit to have an actual mechanic diagnose this and figure out how it happened and why it happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I know how it happened because I purchased the oil coolant line. Ron and his brother showed me that the oil coolant line blew.\n\nJudge: And who am I supposed to get the answer from? That both should be changed at the same time?\n\nPlaintiff: Ron’s brother told me that.\n\nJudge: That’s not evidence. That’s hearsay. I need an expert.\n\nDefendant: He told me he was coming out of work, it was pouring rain, and he was going up Southington Mountain, a steep hill. He saw the oil light come on, then he saw the oil pressure gauge go down to zero. He continued to drive the truck.\n\nJudge: But your knowledge of whether he continued to drive it after the lights turned on is based on what?\n\nDefendant: That’s what he told me.\n\nJudge: You guys are fascinating. You take up my time in court, but you don't think to bring an expert witness to confirm what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Ron told me that the engine was seized.\n\nJudge: You need a mechanic’s report saying the cause of failure was X. Do you have that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: You’re suing for the money you paid for the truck, brake pads, registration, oil, and lost wages. What was the day of purchase?\n\nPlaintiff: I believe it was the 7th.\n\nDefendant: It was a good running truck when I had it. I feel really bad, but I don’t feel guilty. The line blew, and he ignored the gauges on the dashboard.\n\nJudge: Did you sell it “as-is?”\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: No, the bill of sale doesn’t say “as-is.”\n\nJudge: Does the bill of sale have a warranty?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it doesn’t.\n\nJudge: The default position in every state is that a used vehicle sale is “as-is” unless otherwise stated. You, as the plaintiff, have the burden of proving your case. You have to show that the failure was due to something the defendant did wrong, not just that the car broke down.\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the defendant.

{"id": "835", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff Edward McKernan Jr. He says his former landlord is trying to pull a fast one on him by only offering to return 50% of his security deposit because he's mad they moved out. He left the place in better shape than when he got it. This is a typical case of a landlord trying to take advantage of a tenant for no good reason, and he's here seeking the $3,200 he's most definitely owed.\n\nThis is the defendant Michael Orus Sr. He says this is a clear-cut case of a tenant breaking a lease, not giving proper notice, and just up and leaving two months early. He's not about to eat the two months’ rent. The security he kept is covering those two months, and he owes this former tenant nothing.\n\nHe's accused of treating a tenant terribly.\n\nAll parties please raise your right hands.\n\nWelcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says his former landlord is screwing him over by keeping half of his security, but the defendant says the plaintiff cutting rent is tough.\n\nIt's the case of renter regret.\n\nDouglas Edward McKernan, right? You are suing Michael Orose Sr. for double the $1,600 security deposit that you say he has wrongfully withheld. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, your honor. So this is the first apartment my wife and I rented as a new couple. We’ve been married for six years. I was in the Marine Corps, got out. This is our first apartment we had together in the United States. She’s an immigrant from the Philippines, so, you know, we were looking around on Craigslist and we decided to move into his apartment.\n\nWe were residents here for two years. Never really had any issues for the most part until around our sixth, seventh month there. I noticed coming home from work late, kind of smelled like a, like a Grateful Dead concert. I guess I’ll leave it at that.\n\nJudge: Don't leave it at that. I don’t know what you're saying.\n\nPlaintiff: Smelled like pot.\n\nJudge: It smelled like marijuana?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay.\n\nJudge: And who lives—what kind of a building is this?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, it’s an old Victorian, three-family home.\n\nJudge: And are there three families living there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I was on the third floor. He was on the first floor. And his son, granddaughter, and new daughter-in-law were in the second floor.\n\nJudge: And which apartment was the smell of marijuana coming from?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it was—you share one stairway, and you would smell it the second you walked in the door going up.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying from the first floor?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you're saying that the smell of marijuana was emanating from his apartment on the first floor?\n\nPlaintiff: All the way up to the third floor. You’d smell it all the way up in the apartment.\n\nJudge: And then, uh, when did that start bothering you?\n\nPlaintiff: Like I said, around probably six months in, your honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what did you do about it? Did you ever mention it to him?\n\nPlaintiff: I mentioned it once. Well, one time it was actually—I didn’t mention it. I didn’t take the initiative and actually tell him. We got into a small altercation about—I think I was like throwing recycling in the trash, like, like individual water bottles in the trash can, and he basically called me out on it. And then I called him out on smelling the, uh, the marijuana in the apartment. So that’s kind of how I brought it up to his attention.\n\nJudge: Okay. So after that?\n\nPlaintiff: Like I said, uh, also to add on to hers, uh, the main reason why we stayed even though she was going through pain was just financially, it was just sound at the time.\n\nJudge: But you have a lease. And your lease takes you through December. So what happens to make you decide, \"I’m leaving\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. Um, that's—that is the lawsuit. He kept our money ‘cause he says we breached a lease. So September 19th of 2018, he called my spouse. He never really communicated with me when it came to business. He always communicated with my wife.\n\nJudge: Why didn't you just say, \"Talk to me,\" instead?\n\nPlaintiff: He always avoided me whenever—\n\nJudge: Why don’t you just call him?\n\nPlaintiff: He wouldn’t answer phone calls. It was just typical.\n\nJudge: Is that it, or you just leave these things to your wife to handle?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ‘cause—\n\nJudge: I live in a house where the guy leaves these things to his wife to handle.\n\n(Laughter in courtroom.)\n\nJudge: Okay, I know exactly what that looks like. Sometimes it’s a good tactic to use your wife—for him and you. But go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: For the most part, he would just dodge all the time.\n\nJudge (Final Verdict): I have a quandary here. And my quandary is this: I think you’ve perjured yourself in my courtroom when you tell me that he told you, “Yeah, no problem, you go ahead and move.” I think that’s perjury. When you tell me that the reason you wanted to move was the health and welfare of your baby and your wife, I think that’s perjury. I think the reason you wanted to move was that there was a friend with an apartment, and it was going to be a better situation for you. I don’t like that.\n\nAnd you’re asking me to enforce the bonanza of a double penalty? I’m not feeling that warm, all-over glow to do it for you. When this is the situation that presents itself.\n\nHowever, you don’t get to keep that $1,600 because you can’t collect rent from someone if you don’t have a CO. That’s the law. And if you can’t collect the rent, then you cannot keep the security deposit to collect the rent because you didn’t have a CO.\n\nBut it’ll be a snowy day in hell before I allow someone to blatantly breach a contract and get double the security deposit. That’s intended as a remedy for unscrupulous landlords and a tenant who is victimized by it, and that security deposit is wrongfully withheld. That’s not for a situation like this. The security deposit was rightfully withheld. You breached the contract.\n\nBut as it turns out, I must return it to him. So it’s not going to be double, but you must return the $1,600 because you can’t collect it as rent. That is my verdict. Good luck, folks.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "playing the victim, deflection, framing the narrative"}
{"id": "483", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says his former landlord was a slacker who wouldn’t fix anything, then had the nerve to call the cops on him, and now won’t return his security. But the defendant says the plaintiff was bad news. It’s the case of “There’s Really No Place Like Home, and It Sucks.” Thank you, Douglas.\n\nBailiff: You're welcome.\n\nJudge: Okay, Jamal Harris. You are suing your former landlord, Alia Fips, for $2,500—$1,425 that you say you’re owed as a security deposit, and the rest for increased electric bills from July 9th to February 12th, which you will explain in a moment. According to you, your landlord improperly kept your security deposit with no rights. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: I moved into the apartment around 2006. Upon moving in, my mother lived there before me. She left a security deposit. Once I moved in, Ms. Fips let me know that there was an increase in the security, so I gave her the cash for the increase. Over the years, I had multiple problems with it. Now, I said the security was $1,425. I just came from court in December. At no time did she say that I owed her anything upon the security deposit. She tried to charge me late fees for being late on my rent. The court told her that she couldn’t charge me. So, upon me moving out, I gave her the keys—\n\nJudge: Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. You guys settled a case in landlord-tenant court, right? And part of the settlement—let me get the settlement by memory—part of the settlement is that you were going to be out. When was that supposed to be?\n\nPlaintiff: I was supposed to be out by the end of January.\n\nJudge: What day in January?\n\nPlaintiff: January 31st.\n\nJudge: January 15th, not 31st. So, middle of January. All right. Were you out in the middle of January?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I wasn’t.\n\nJudge: When did you get out?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t leave until March 2nd, 2012.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. Why did you leave on March 2nd when you were supposed to be out January 15th?\n\nPlaintiff: Being that I receive a subsidy from Section 8, I can't move and do anything without their approval. They didn’t give me my approval situation until the 15th of February.\n\nJudge: But the court gave you a deadline. You seem to think that your Section 8 problems are her problems. You were on a month-to-month lease that was already terminated by a court of law, where you agreed to do certain things. That’s the problem—sticking around until March 2nd. Tell me your side of this.\n\nDefendant: Mr. Harris rented the apartment from me after his mother, who was a very good tenant, lived there. She recommended that I leave the apartment with her son.\n\nJudge: How long did she live there?\n\nDefendant: She lived there for four years.\n\nJudge: Was she on Section 8?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She came off Section 8 but transferred it to her son. When she left it with this able-bodied man, I thought he would be able to pay his portion of the rent, which was only $365–$369. It varied according to his income, because he was working at that time. I constantly had to take him to housing court. I took him to housing court in 2008, 2009, and when I notified him in May of 2011, I gave him notice that his lease that expired in July 2011 would not be renewed. From then on, he had a vendetta. He told me he was going to make my life miserable before he left, and he did. He punched holes in doors, broke tiles, broke cabinet doors, and did all kinds of destructive things to the apartment. Section 8, when they came in, told me I had to fix them and take him to court for the money.\n\nJudge: So, you had issues with him not paying and damaging the apartment?\n\nDefendant: Yes. The court told him he should be out by January 15th, but he stayed until March. I allowed him to work out whatever his problems were and leave peacefully, because it was a constant fight between both of us. He would intimidate me, come up in my face. He thought because he’s a man and I’m a woman, he could intimidate me.\n\nJudge: Do you think anybody can intimidate you? Of all people?\n\nDefendant: He then told me he was going to leave by the end of February. He didn’t. He left on March 2nd. Technically, even according to the letter I read from Section 8, he actually owes me for the entire month of March. I didn’t charge him for that. I charged him just for the two days he stayed.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you charge him for all of March?\n\nDefendant: First of all, the $128 wouldn’t even cover the $1,425 anyway. But it was mainly the repairs to the doors and tiles.\n\nJudge: I don’t even need to get into whether you were allowed to do that or not. The fact is, he admits he stayed past the deadline. Do you understand that when you’re there in March, you owe rent for March?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand that, but—\n\nJudge: So why are you suing if you owe rent for March? Why are you suing to get money back when you still owe her money?\n\nPlaintiff: Do I get to speak now?\n\nJudge: Do you hear what I just said?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand.\n\nJudge: At some point, you have to take responsibility. The verdict is for the defendant. You don’t get any of your security deposit back.

So, I come out, and I have a flat tire. I'm with my cousin, and she said there's a gas station at the corner.

And, um, that person sells you a $60 tire?\n\nPlaintiff: The guy comes out, and, uh, usually a, uh, used tire is $40. So, he comes out, and he says to me, \"I can give you this new tire for $60.\"\n\nJudge: A new tire?\n\nPlaintiff: He said a new tire for $60.\n\nJudge: So, what kind of tire was it?\n\nPlaintiff: I have no idea, Your Honor. I know nothing about— I still don’t know.\n\nJudge: Do you have paperwork?\n\nPlaintiff: I have, uh, paperwork from Volkswagen because I went for inspection, and Volkswagen would not pass my inspection because of that tire.\n\nJudge: Okay, so let’s slow down a second. Let’s back it up. When did you buy the tire from them?\n\nPlaintiff: I got the tire from them on July 30th.\n\nJudge: Are you sure?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m positive.\n\nJudge: Because your complaint says it’s July 24th.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s the date that I got the used tire.\n\nJudge: That’s what I’m asking.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s fine.\n\nJudge: So, July 24th, you got the used tire from them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, I thought you said you bought a new tire for $60 from them?\n\nPlaintiff: So that’s not a used tire. I went to get a used tire, but—\n\nJudge: But you ended up with a new tire for $60?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So that’s on 7/24. And when is it that you go in for inspection and Volkswagen tells you you need a new tire?\n\nPlaintiff: On the 30th.\n\nJudge: Okay. You go in for inspection.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And what do they tell you? What does Volkswagen tell you?\n\nPlaintiff: They tell me that my car is fine. I pay for inspection, except for that front—\n\nJudge: May I see something from Volkswagen saying that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: (Reading) During service, found right front tire has a bubble in the sidewall. Did they show you the bubble?\n\nPlaintiff: Volkswagen?\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: You never saw the bubble yourself?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: And so you paid them $185 for the new tire?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, to pass inspection.\n\nJudge: Do you have paperwork from this transaction?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor, I don’t.\n\nJudge: Why don’t you? Like, wouldn’t you—?\n\nDefendant: I— I would, uh, normally, Your Honor. But, uh, this particular sale was a, um— it was a cash— cash sale, and I don’t— didn’t bring the receipt. I’m sorry.\n\nJudge: Okay. Uh— Why? We don’t tell the taxman about cash transactions?   \n\nJudge: Did you ever talk to your employee to see if he remembered?\n\nDefendant: I did, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And did he remember the situation?\n\nDefendant: Absolutely, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: All right. Did she buy a new tire or a used tire?\n\nDefendant: She did not. She purchased a used tire.\n\nJudge: She purchased a used tire. Now, the used tire has a bubble in it. You shouldn’t be selling it, right?\n\nDefendant: Well, a bubble is a side bulge, and it’s usually caused from an impact on a tire.\n\nJudge: Okay, so if you sold her a used tire that had a bubble in it, how— how— your used tires— tell me how the process works. Would you know it had a bubble in it?\n\nDefendant: You absolutely would see it.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant: Because it would be visible to the eye.\n\nJudge: So it’s a 60-buck tire. Even if it’s defective for 60 bucks, does the plaintiff have any recourse here?\n\nSpectator: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nSpectator: Because, um, it’s— it’s a matter of he should have known that tire was bad.\n\nJudge: It was a used tire.\n\nSpectator: It’s a used tire.\n\nJudge: But isn’t it a thing of where you get what you pay for?\n\nSpectator: You get what you pay for.\n\nJudge: So 60 bucks— any recourse if it’s defective?\n\nSpectator: Yeah, they should have checked and made sure it wasn’t defective before they bought it.\n\nJudge: But whose obligation is that? Isn’t that the customer’s or the business’s?\n\nSpectator: Both.\n\nJudge: Oh. Okay. Going inside the courtroom— did you see a bubble in the tire when they sold it to you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t see a bubble.\n\nJudge: You never saw a bubble?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: All right. But now, if that tire had a bubble in it— tell me what a bubble is.\n\nDefendant: It’s a protruding, uh, bulge on the tire.\n\nJudge: And it comes from what? How does it happen?\n\nDefendant: It comes from impact on the tire.\n\nJudge: Okay, so if the tire’s not on her car, could it have a bubble?\n\nDefendant: No, you wouldn’t see it unless it was—\n\nJudge: If the tire was inflated?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the tire is not inflated until it’s put on her car?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: Because what? It’s in between the treads?\n\nDefendant: No, it’s on the sidewall of the tire.\n\nJudge: It’s on the sidewall?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And an uninflated tire— I’m just trying to understand— an uninflated tire that got reinflated and has a bubble in it because of an impact in its prior life, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: That could come out again once inflated?\n\nDefendant: Once it’s inflated, yes.\n\nJudge: That— that is a true fact, what I just said?\n\nDefendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: I was just curious. All right. But you would see it?\n\nDefendant: Yes, you would.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you never saw it. How do you know these guys at that dealership weren’t just trying to rack up a bill?\n\nPlaintiff: What do you mean?\n\nJudge: I don’t know how to make myself any clearer.\n\nJudge: And then you drove the car for six days. Did you hit any potholes or anything strong, or park a little bit into something?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nPlaintiff: This is a credit only because, like, I’m standing there boohoo-ing, and I said, \"Just give me some of my money back.\" Like, I just gave you $60, and I just paid $185— I’m not paying $300 for a tire.\n\nPlaintiff: So the boss was there from the guy who originally sold me the tire, and the boss said to him, \"Give her a credit.\"\n\nJudge: So he gave you the date on it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What else do you sell besides tires?\n\nDefendant: Rims. We have, uh, hubcaps.\n\nJudge: May I say something, please?\n\nJudge: What else can she buy with her 60-buck credit besides a tire? Because she doesn’t want to buy any more tires.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m not.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nDefendant: We’ve been in business for over 30 years. We’ve always had the same policy— no cash refunds. We give store credits.\n\nJudge: That’s not advertised.\n\nJudge: First of all, you don’t even have paperwork, so let’s start with that.\n\nJudge: But if they were to give you a warranty— like this other tire company, do you give a warranty?\n\nDefendant: Yes, we do.\n\nJudge: How many days?\n\nDefendant: 30.\n\nJudge: On a used tire?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then what a warranty entitles you to is to get another tire.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: It does not entitle you to a money refund back.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: And you’re accepting nothing less than a money refund?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Because you say, \"They sold me a tire with a bubble in it.\"\n\nJudge: And I say, if in fact they did that, then they owe you $60.\n\nJudge: The problem you’re having is, how are you going to prove this case?\n\nJudge: You looked at the tire when it was put on. You didn’t see a bubble. You drove it for six days.\n\nJudge: You take it to Volkswagen. Volkswagen tells you there’s a bubble.\n\nJudge: And you still don’t see a bubble.\n\nJudge: A bubble is something that you see. It’s a protrusion in the sidewall.\n\nJudge: And you’re driving it around for six days.\n\nJudge: How am I going to tell them, \"I know for a fact that you sold her that tire with a bubble in it\"?\n\nJudge: How am I going to say that to her on the facts of this case?\n\nJudge: I can’t.\n\nDefendant: Your Honor—\n\nJudge: Yeah?\n\nDefendant: And if Miss Green had brought the tire back, we were willing to give her a credit, even if she had a bubble in the tire, because we would have to honor our 30-day guarantee.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant: That’s not—\n\nJudge: Well, that’s what ended up happening.\n\nJudge: He wrote down \"$60 credit\" on a business card?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Is that valid?\n\nDefendant: Well, yes, it is. That’s what we use for credits.\n\nDefendant: But the thing is, if she had come back with the tire and wanted a new tire instead of buying one from Volkswagen, she could have come back and applied the $60 credit—\n\nDefendant: Applied the $60 credit towards getting a different tire.\n\nJudge: Diane, I get it.\n\nJudge: I don’t know if it sounds like I don’t get it, but I get it.\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, deflection,emotional appeal"}
{"id": "827", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you. As Diane Aen, otherwise known as Diane Vigata. Which would you like me to call you?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): I prefer Vigata. I just got... I’m married to May, so...\n\nJudge: Oh, well, congratulations.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Thank you.\n\nJudge: You’re suing Family Auto Sales, owned by Chris Pendle, yes?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: Okay. For $820, the balance that you say is owed back to you on a car that you took back to him. All right, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): We bought a car, in May of this year, a used car from his dealership.\n\nJudge: What day?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): The bill of sale is for, let’s see what it says... 5/24.\n\nJudge: Okay. What kind of car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): It’s a Grand Cherokee Jeep, 1995.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh, and what happens? What goes wrong?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Well, when we first took it for the test drive, we saw that there were some broken lights on the interior as well as the speedometer wasn’t working. So before we took possession of the car, he agreed that he was going to fix those things, and he, in fact, did do that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): And when we purchased the car, the odometer said 159,000 miles on it. But when we got it back, he actually had to replace the whole unit, so it took the mileage up to 200,000, which we didn’t like.\n\nJudge: Why did it do that?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): It was a replacement. They’re not easy to get new. I called Chris beforehand and asked him if that was okay; otherwise, I could have it reprogrammed.\n\nJudge: Who’s Chris?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Her husband.\n\nJudge: Husband?\n\nDefendant (Chris): He said that was fine.\n\nJudge: Was that fine?\n\nDefendant (Chris): It was fine until I told my wife.\n\nJudge: Exactly! Cook Douglas. What’s the correct daughter? Find out if it’s fine.\n\nJudge: Okay, and now you’ve been married how long?\n\nDefendant (Chris): 20 minutes.\n\nJudge: I get to know this lesson!\n\nJudge: I was married once before for 20 years.\n\nDefendant (Chris): Yeah, how’d that work out?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Married again?\n\nDefendant (Chris): Oh, to her!\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Oh, you were married to her for 20 years?\n\nDefendant (Chris): No, no. My first wife was married.\n\nJudge: Okay, all right. We’ve been married only since May.\n\nJudge: Listen, you got to train him better than the last one, okay? Laughs Lordy, lordy.\n\nJudge: Speak first, ask questions later. Okay, so now it was fine. You agree you told him it was fine, and then your wife didn’t like it. All right, so go on.\n\nDefendant (Chris): Well, that wasn’t the issue with the car. I mean, the sunroof leaked profusely into the car and just drenched everywhere. And we told him about it, and there was also an oil leak under the car. So he said, “Okay, he would fix it.” I mean, you don’t sell a car that’s not roadworthy. Those kinds of things, it shouldn’t be sold that way.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): I mean, the first rainstorm, the rain comes right in.\n\nDefendant (Chris): So he agreed to fix it, but we got it back, and it continued to leak, and we continued to notice the oil leak under the car. So we were getting very annoyed. I mean, he was, you know, we liked each other at first, everything was fine. But, you know, he became more and more contentious because these things were not getting fixed.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So finally, when we took it back... I mean, I can show you the pictures of how they finally repaired it. The sunroof was all gummed up with silicone, and I have photographs of that, which was not really the way it didn’t look nice. But we were so sick of taking it back and forth. We said, “Okay.”\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So here are the pictures of that. Okay. And so the car was running a little rough, and my husband decided to get an oil change. He said, “Maybe that would make it feel, you know, run a little bit better.”\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So when he went to take it to get an oil change, the mechanic called him over and said, “Come and take a look at this underneath the car,” and he showed the transfer box underneath the car had been gummed up with the very same silicone that you see there. And I have pictures of that on the transfer box.\n\nJudge: What’s your response to that?\n\nDefendant (Chris): There are multiple things on the car that can leak. My mechanic told me that they fixed an oil pan leak.\n\nJudge: How did they fix it?\n\nDefendant (Chris): Silicone gaskets are sometimes used for the gaskets. I don’t know what was used for what we’re talking about here.\n\nJudge: Okay, let’s take a look at what Tomaz...\n\nDefendant (Chris): What’s that?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Um, pretty close-up. But if they say it’s the transfer case, I wouldn’t disagree.\n\nJudge: Okay. Would that be an appropriate repair, though, or would that be sort of like a cheap and fast and easy way to finish it?\n\nDefendant (Chris): Fast, it would be a short and easy way to do it.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you sell this car with a warranty?\n\nDefendant (Chris): Yes.\n\nJudge: And how long is the warranty?\n\nDefendant (Chris): 30 days.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, at some point, you decide you don’t want the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Yeah.\n\nJudge: When do you decide you don’t want the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): It was after the... after we discovered the silicone underneath.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): It was probably whatever the date is on that invoice. It’s probably the invoice, which is July.\n\nJudge: Okay, so it’s after the 30-day warranty has expired.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Right.\n\nJudge: All right. And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): You talk to him?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So we tell him the situation. We tell him it was a dangerous repair. He should never have repaired it that way. I mean, if you go and you say you’re repairing something, you know, you would assume it would be repaired the right way, not some faulty way. He is a business owner.\n\nDefendant (Chris): Right.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So to repair it the right way would cost how much?\n\nDefendant (Chris): I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Exactly! So if it would cost 50 bucks or 100 bucks, that would be your measure of damages here, but that’s not what you wanted. You, in general, you were disillusioned. You were no longer in love with the car. You didn’t want it.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So you called him and who does the negotiating to return the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): We both did. Tell me about it.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): So we went to his shop, and we told him that, you know, the car that he initially sold us was not roadworthy. He shouldn’t have sold it that way. It had problems that were never fixed.\n\nJudge: Did you ever have a mechanic look at the car before?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): No.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): No, we did not.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that’s a good idea, isn’t it?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Well, I will in the future because nobody wants to pay the mechanic the 150 bucks or whatever to inspect the car. But sometimes you’re Pennywise and pound-foolish if you don’t do that.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Can I show you one more picture, Your Honor? When we did return the car to him, the thing sort of exploded underneath the car, and I don’t know if it was some silicone coming up.\n\nJudge: On the day that you're returning it?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Wait, like, what do you mean?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): The day we returned it, yes.\n\nJudge: You’re driving in, and the thing explodes underneath the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Yes.\n\nJudge: Oh, that’s poetic. Really?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Yes and no.\n\nJudge: Not the same piece?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): No.\n\nJudge: So would you ever buy a ’95 Cherokee?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): No.\n\nJudge: No? Why?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Too much time has passed on the car. It’s a 17-year-old car.\n\nJudge: I mean, can a 17-year-old car be a good car?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): I don’t think so. Too much has gone through. You don’t know how many owners it’s had.\n\nJudge: How about a Mercedes?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): I wouldn’t buy it.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): What do you think? You get the final word?\n\nDefendant (Chris): No. I’m not stupid.\n\nJudge: What?\n\nDefendant (Chris): I’m not stupid.\n\nJudge: Okay, going inside the G room.\n\nJudge: I want to understand something, though. You negotiated with him, and he says, you’ve owned the car for what was it at that point?\n\nDefendant (Chris): It was right around 6 weeks, I believe.\n\nJudge: Six weeks. Um, I don’t know how you’ve driven it. I realize I may have some fault; maybe you have some fault, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll offer you $2,000.\n\nDefendant (Chris): Now, a lot of people would say, “No, I want $2,800.”\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Well, that’s what I did. We went in there.\n\nJudge: Right, but at some point you take the $2,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Yes, I did take it.\n\nJudge: Why did you take the $2,000?\n\nPlaintiff (Diane/Vigata): Because it’s better than zero.\n\nJudge: Right. It’s particularly better than zero if you can take the $2,000 and then say, “Just kidding, psych!” and go to court.\n\nJudge: Did she sign something? Please tell me you had her sign something.\n\nDefendant (Chris): I believe I did, but I think I was in a rush to get them out, and I believe I gave them the signed copy.\n\nJudge: I have a signed copy here. Let’s see what it is.\n\nDefendant (Chris): I didn’t sign a release.\n\nJudge: Seeing that I wouldn’t continue to get my full... What this says... I’ll see if... I’ll tell you if it’s a settlement or not.\n\nDefendant (Chris): Hold on. It looks like a settlement.\n\nJudge: So, I got to see what you signed.\n\nDefendant (Chris): I, Chris Pendle of Family Auto Sales, have agreed with Diana VY to purchase back the 1995 Grand Cherokee, VIN number blah, in the amount of $2,000.\n\nJudge: How is that not a settlement?\n\nDefendant (Chris): Well, I didn’t... I know it doesn’t have the magic words, which would be better if you had magic words that say, “I hereby release all future...” but it doesn’t have to have those magic words. See, here’s the idea: courts want to encourage... long pause Why? They want you guys, when you’re in the thick of things, when each of you have something to lose and something to gain, to negotiate and not bother us.\n\nJudge: Okay? Because we’re really, really busy. We have a lot of cases. We want to encourage parties to settle amongst themselves. You know what a good settlement is? You both walk away unhappy. That’s a good deal. Unhappy, not happy. Unhappy.\n\nJudge: That’s a mark of a good deal, where you feel like you give, they feel like they’re both unhappy. Not one’s unhappy, both unhappy. Then you know that.\n\nJudge: So everybody gave up a little something, right?\n\nJudge: Okay, and the idea is that we don’t want to overflood the courts. So when you guys settle, the law says you’ve got to respect the settlement.\n\nJudge: Okay, if this paper didn’t exist, and the testimony were, “Well, yeah, I told them I’d take the $2,000 because that’s... because I just wanted $2,000 better than zero,” but I was always planning on that still being a settlement. Okay?\n\nJudge: That’s a settlement. You can’t come back and sue for the rest of the amount.\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Deflection, Minimization, Gaslighting, Dismissal"}

What happened in this case?\n\nPlaintiff: On January 3rd, he was recommended from a mutual person that worked in the industry because I was doing dry cleaning and laundry, and so was he. And I was going to fold the business.\n\nOn that day, I made arrangements to pay my creditors and sell all my equipment. And he walked in an hour before that happened and stopped the whole thing. And I, you know, made sure that he was really interested because people were renting trucks to pull the equipment out and all that, and I had to pay for all that.\n\nSo he said yeah. And so the next— that day, I showed him what he wanted: the utility bills and the lease. And then I had to show him this document.\n\nJudge: Which is what?\n\nPlaintiff: Which is the agreement. I was in court with the landlord, and the increase in my rent was going to $1,000 in July, I believe.\n\nJudge: What'd you go to court with your landlord for?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to court— I stopped paying her rent because the increase was too steep.\n\nJudge: Right, but you didn't pay her the other rent either, not just the thousand, but nothing.\n\nHow long had you not been paying rent?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, not sure because—\n\nJudge: How much rent did you owe? Look at the statement. Look at the settlement.\n\nPlaintiff: How much rent did I owe? Uh, I had to give her $225,000—\n\nJudge: Towards?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, leaving a balance of $30,000.\n\nJudge: So you had $50,000 in back—\n\nPlaintiff: 50— well—\n\nJudge: And how much was your rent?\n\nPlaintiff: That— $3,200.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you had been in arrears for quite a bit of time.\n\nYou sold your business to him for how much?\n\nPlaintiff: I really didn't sell the business. I paid $100,000 for the business, and I let him have it at about— I asked for $10,000 and free wash. I gave it to him for $5,000 in free wash—\n\nJudge: $10,000?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked him for $10,000 cash so that I could continue to wash my clothes there.\n\nJudge: Your personal clothing?\n\nPlaintiff: My personal stuff.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Permanently. Because I didn't sell the business to him.\n\nJudge: You didn’t sell the business?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really, because the business— the market—\n\nJudge: You didn’t sell the business to him? Then why are you suing him today?\n\nPlaintiff: To pay the debt to the business, because we made an agreement that he’d give me $5,000, and I would get the free wash permanently.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I let him take over the business at that point. I don't feel like I was really selling it because I—\n\nJudge: So what were you doing? Why was he giving you five grand?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, to take over the business, he had to give me something. I just couldn’t give it to him.\n\nJudge: So you sold him the business for five grand?\n\nPlaintiff: Pretty much. Pretty much, I sold it to him for five grand, you could say.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nWhy do you then think he also owes you?\n\nPlaintiff: Apparently, I had to pay the landlord 25 grand.\n\nJudge: And how did you pay that 25 grand?\n\nPlaintiff: The business had a credit line of $25,000 from American Express. It was there all the time. Always there.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nPlaintiff: So I took the credit line, got $25,000 from a card that the business had, paid the landlord that.\n\nAnd your opinion, and the reason you've come to court, is that you think he's responsible to pay that?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s not exactly how this worked out—\n\nJudge: I don’t even understand your lawsuit.\n\nPlaintiff: So—\n\nJudge: Because you're asking for $1,600, and you amended it today to $27,500. What is $27,500?\n\nPlaintiff: That represents what?\n\nJudge: The payments that he didn’t make towards the card when he took over the business.\n\nPlaintiff: Oh.\n\nJudge: Towards the card where you took out $25,000 to pay for your back rent?\n\nPlaintiff: That was the agreement— for him to take all the expenses, and then I sign the business—\n\nJudge: When are you planning on paying the $25,000?\n\nPlaintiff: Are you ever going to pay down the credit card?\n\nPlaintiff: I made an agreement with him to take over the business and all the expenses. If he took the business, he had to take all the expenses with it because I really didn’t—\n\nJudge: So your plan is to never pay the $25,000?\n\nPlaintiff: My plan was—\n\nJudge: And for him to pay the carrying cost of the $25,000?\n\nPlaintiff: You never pay—\n\nJudge: I think that’s right. I think that’s what you're saying.\n\nPlaintiff: The deal that I made with Eric Pakun was for him, if he wanted the business, to take over all the expenses.\n\nJudge: I am asking you a very direct question, and I need a very direct answer.\n\nSo you're saying any interest and fees on the $25,000 in perpetuity he has to pay, and the $25,000 you never have to pay back?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: That was one of the payments that he had made?\n\nDefendant: No, your honor—\n\nJudge: Verdict for the defendant.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, persuasion"}

Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says her upstairs neighbor’s fish tank leaked and flooded her apartment, but the defendant says it was just a little water and he steam-cleaned the plaintiff’s couch. It’s the case of Holy Mackerel! You have sworn, your honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Merlene Washington, you are suing your upstairs neighbor, Stafford Banister, for $2,448.60 in damages that you say you have sustained as a result of water that leaked into your apartment from his fish tank. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nMerlene Washington (Plaintiff): On the 27th of February, I got home at about 9:00 PM, and I switched on my TV. I heard these popping sounds, and I was wondering what it could be. As I walked over to the TV, I realized that my carpet was soaked. So I switched on the light and saw that the whole ceiling was wet, my couch was wet, the carpet was wet—just about everything was wet. I realized the water was coming from upstairs, so I went up and knocked on his door. I said to him, “You have water coming down in my apartment. Come down and take a look.”\n\nJudge: What did he say when you knocked on his door?\n\nPlaintiff: I think he said he was going to come down in a while.\n\nJudge: He didn’t say why you had water in your apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, so then what?\n\nPlaintiff: I went back down to my apartment and was looking around in shock because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. After about five minutes, I went back up to his apartment and knocked again. I said, “You need to come down and see my apartment because it’s wet.” I went back down and waited, but he didn’t come. So I went back up a third time and knocked on his door again. I said, “You need to come down and see my apartment because my whole apartment is wet.”\n\nJudge: And what did he say then?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, “I’m coming, I’m coming. Let me put some clothes on or whatever.”\n\nJudge: Okay, then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I went back down, and he finally came down. I asked him, “What happened in your apartment?” He said his fish tank leaked. He told me he came home at 12:00 PM and saw his fish tank leaking.\n\nJudge: So he knew his fish tank was leaking since noon?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes! I told him, “I left here at 1:30 PM. If you came home and saw your fish tank leaking, you could have knocked on my door so I could move my things around so they wouldn’t get wet.” He said something about trying to save his fish. I said, “You’re trying to save your fish, and all my things are damaged?” And then he said, “Oh, you have nice things.”\n\nJudge: What do you mean by that? Was he being sarcastic?\n\nPlaintiff: Maybe not. He just said, “You have nice things.” Then he moved one of the pillows off the couch and placed it over to the other side. I moved it back because one side of the apartment was dry, and one side was wet, so I wanted to keep all the wet things together. The light fixture on my ceiling even had water in it!\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here they are.\n\nJudge: How long have you two been neighbors? Did you know each other before this?\n\nPlaintiff: I’ve seen him a couple of times.\n\nJudge: How long have you lived there?\n\nPlaintiff: About 40 years.\n\nJudge: And you, sir?\n\nStafford Banister (Defendant): Two years.\n\nJudge: Okay, what happened with your fish tank?\n\nDefendant: I have a 90-gallon fish tank.\n\nJudge: That’s pretty big.\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it’s a big tank.\n\nJudge: What kind of fish do you have?\n\nDefendant: I have three fish: a shark and two others.\n\nJudge: A shark?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, it’s about seven inches long.\n\nJudge: And the other two?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know what they are.\n\nJudge: You have a 90-gallon tank, and you don’t know what’s in it?\n\nDefendant: I bought them a while ago, and I just don’t remember.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what happened with the tank?\n\nDefendant: I tried to find out where the leak was, but I couldn’t. I put pots, pans, and towels down, but the water kept leaking. I had to get the fish out so they wouldn’t die. I put them in a big plastic tub and then pumped the rest of the water into the sink. Then I took the tank outside and threw it away.\n\nJudge: Did you go downstairs to tell her?\n\nDefendant: I knocked on her door, but no one answered.\n\nJudge: Did you leave a note?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, so then what happened?\n\nDefendant: She came up later, knocked on my door, and I was in my shorts and underclothes still dealing with the mess.\n\nJudge: Sir, how long does it take a man to put on pants?\n\nDefendant: I know, I know. I was just—\n\nJudge: She had to come up three times. You didn’t wait long in between visits, right?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nDefendant: I eventually put on my pants and went downstairs. I saw the water on the ceiling, the soaked couch, and the drenched carpet.\n\nJudge: Yeah, so?\n\nDefendant: I got someone to steam clean the couch and the carpet.\n\nPlaintiff: But that didn’t fix the damage! My belongings still smell like fish, and my furniture is ruined.\n\nJudge: Is putting a seven-inch shark in a 90-gallon tank cruel or cool?\n\nAudience Member 1: It’s cool because sharks are animals, and animals are pets.\n\nAudience Member 2: If you’re impeding its growth, then it’s a little cruel.\n\nAudience Member 3: If it’s used to a big, wide-open ocean, then it’s cruel.\n\nJudge: Fair enough. Back to the case. So you did clean the apartment, but you think she just wants all-new things?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: My things were damaged!

{"id": "160", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case in the docket, the plaintiff says her own cousin stiffed her on daycare services, but the defendant says the plaintiff was a lousy daycare worker. It’s the case of \"She Don't Care About Daycare.\" Okay, Anastasia Graves, you are suing Donna Bulock, your cousin, doing business as Donna B’s Daydreaming Center. This is the daycare center?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Daydreaming Center.\n\nJudge: Okay, for $5,000 in pain and suffering, taxes, and $750 that you say you weren’t paid in your last paycheck. What’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff: I worked for her. She hired me November 17, 2008, and I worked for her until April 17, 2010. My last check, she did not give me, but she paid everybody else. Then I filed taxes—\n\nJudge: Hold on one second. Your last check was for what?\n\nPlaintiff: The month of March and April.\n\nJudge: For March toward April?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, because you get paid every third Friday.\n\nJudge: And you were getting paid $750 a month?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. When she fired you, did she tell you why she was firing you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, and she never fired me. I left off the premises because she didn’t pay me.\n\nJudge: Okay, did you give her a chance to pay you before you left?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because she said she wasn’t paying nobody. I called her—\n\nJudge: Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: And she said, \"Don’t call me, I’ll call you.\"\n\nJudge: Okay. Had you already been having problems with her paying late or anything like that?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t have no problems with her at all before that.\n\nJudge: Were you socializing as cousins, or was she strictly your employer?\n\nPlaintiff: We was talking, we was all that. It wasn’t no problems. I didn’t have no problems with her.\n\nJudge: All right. And at this daycare, her mother was working?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Was your great aunt?\n\nPlaintiff: Yep.\n\nJudge: And you were getting along fine with her?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, we got into arguments a couple times, but it wasn’t like part of the daycare.\n\nJudge: All right. So when she tells you, \"Don’t call me, I’ll call you,\" your paycheck is how late at that point?\n\nPlaintiff: It was only a day late already.\n\nJudge: So it’s odd that you would quit over something like that when you’ve been working there for all those years and the payment was only a day late. What made you decide to walk off?\n\nPlaintiff: Because gratitude, basically.\n\nJudge: Yeah, and she told other employees to come to her house that Friday to get their money, and they got paid that day?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So when was it you decided to quit? When you found out that others did get paid?\n\nPlaintiff: I quit the same day because she told me she wasn’t going to pay me.\n\nJudge: And did she tell you why she felt she didn’t have to pay you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she didn’t. She just told me to leave her alone.\n\nDefendant: Judge, I did pay her. What she’s talking about when she walked off the premises— that’s not that she just walked off the premises. I came into the job, I don’t know what had happened before I got there. There was— she was swearing at me, cussing at me. I said, \"You’re not going to talk to me that way, and I need you to leave off the premises.\"\n\nJudge: That’s why she says it’s because you had a dispute over payment. So you do know what happened before you got there.\n\nDefendant: No, we didn’t have a dispute over payment because that was a payment day, and I was coming to do payroll that day.\n\nJudge: Stop. So what is the reason then that she’s mad?\n\nDefendant: I have no idea.\n\nJudge: I find that to be untruthful because people know why their employees of two years who happen to be their cousin are so mad. Something happened, and you know what it is that happened. Why won’t you tell me?\n\nDefendant: I’m going to tell you what happened. It started before the payment issue. There were things going on at the daycare with my mom and her. She cussed my mom out. My mom allowed them to go into her house to get different items, and then her medication came up missing, money came up missing. My mother’s a diabetic. She couldn’t get her medication when she needed it. When I questioned everybody about what happened, nobody had an answer.\n\nJudge: What day of the month was this?\n\nDefendant: Around April 17th, that Friday.\n\nJudge: What day do you pay your employees?\n\nDefendant: Once a month.\n\nJudge: And that was the day you were supposed to pay her?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Prove you paid her. Show me the canceled check.\n\nDefendant: I didn’t pay her in check, I paid her in cash. Because she was on DSS and couldn’t let them know she was working, so I paid her under the table.\n\nJudge: Prove it. Where’s your ledger?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t bring my ledger because her name is not on it. I don’t write her name on it.\n\nJudge: $750 verdict for the plaintiff, plus court costs.

{"id": "957", "dialogue": "**Judge:**\nThis is the case of Chenise Hawkins. She says she put down a deposit on an apartment and was ready to move in when the defendant abruptly changed her mind and rented the place to someone else. Now, the defendant refuses to return her \\$500, which the plaintiff believes is unfair. She is here suing for the money.\n\n**Plaintiff (Chenise Hawkins):**\nOn the evening of October 21st, I contacted Glattus to see an apartment she was renting. We liked the place, so we left a cash deposit. She wanted us to bring more information the next day, which I did. I brought my pay stubs and everything. She then told me that a few other couples had come and seen the place as well and were willing to give her \\$500 to move in that day until November 1st.\n\n**Judge:**\nAnd you were planning to rent it from November 1st?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nYes.\n\n**Judge:**\nSo what did she ask you for?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nShe asked me for an additional \\$250 to move in that day.\n\n**Judge:**\nOr else what?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nShe’d rent it to the other people.\n\n**Judge:**\nAnd what did you say when she said that to you?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nAt first, I agreed. Then I went home and discussed it with my fiancé, and we decided that November 1st was better because I had already paid rent for October.\n\n**Judge:**\nDid you call her back and tell her that?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nI did. I called her back the next morning, and she said she was going to teach me the law and that I could only get \\$500 back.\n\n**Judge:**\nWas the topic ever discussed that you could just go ahead and move in as planned?\n\n**Plaintiff:**\nNo, she did not. She wanted the extra \\$250.\n\n**Defendant (Glattus Hoffman):**\nShe came on the 21st with her boyfriend. I showed them the apartment, and they loved it. They asked me what the requirements were, and I told them one month’s security and one month’s rent. Once a deposit is made, I cannot rent it to anyone else.\n\n**Judge:**\nDid you call them and tell them you had other interested renters?\n\n**Defendant:**\nYes, she came back with her documents, and I told her about the other people.\n\n**Judge:**\nWhy were you trying to get another \\$250 if you couldn't rent it to anyone else?\n\n**Defendant:**\nBecause it was 10 days from the 21st to the 31st, so I said I would take off five days and she would only pay for five.\n\n**Judge:**\nBut why did you do that? If she already had the apartment, why were you trying to charge her more?\n\n**Defendant:**\nThey paid \\$1,000, and then she came back, and I told her about the other offer. She went outside and called her fiancé. Then she came back in.\n\n**Judge:**\nIf your premise is that the \\$1,000 deposit secured the apartment, meaning you couldn’t rent it to anyone else, then why did you ask for an additional \\$250? That sounds like extortion. She already had the apartment for November 1st, so she didn't have to give you another penny. You changed the deal, not her.\n\n**Defendant:**\nI told them the requirements from the beginning.\n\n**Judge:**\nDid you tell them after accepting the \\$1,000 deposit that they needed to give you another \\$250 the next day?\n\n**Defendant:**\nYes.\n\n**Judge:**\nYou can't do that. Once you accepted their deposit, you had an oral agreement. You can’t turn around and demand more money. You breached the contract, not her. And when she backed out, you rented it to someone else the same day. You didn’t lose anything. In fact, you made an extra \\$500.\n\n**Defendant:**\nBut they changed their mind.\n\n**Judge:**\nNo, she always planned to move in on November 1st. You tried to charge her more after the fact. If you had other renters, why didn’t you just return her deposit and rent to them?\n\n**Defendant:**\nI did rent it to them.\n\n**Judge:**\nThen you’re out nothing. Keeping the deposit is meant to cover a loss, not to give you extra profit. Pay the plaintiff her \\$500.

{"id": "811", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the case of Kevin McLoud vs. Angela Hutchinson. Mr. McLoud, you are suing your ex-girlfriend and the mother of your daughter, Ms. Hutchinson, for $1,400 that you claim she stole from your Macy’s account by using an old card that she was once authorized to use and charging $1,400 worth of gift cards. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Kevin McLoud): Okay, so I’m in the process of buying a house. I ran my credit and saw that there were some charges on my Macy’s card that I rarely ever use. So, I initiated a fraud claim through Macy’s. When I did that, they told me to go file a police report. When I filed the police report, the police told me to find out any more information that I could from Macy’s.\n\nMacy’s told me that someone ordered a card, had it sent to an address, and used it four days later. That’s when all the charges were made on December 30th. Someone went on December 30th and bought a $500 gift card, another $500 gift card, and a $400 gift card. I don’t know what they did with the gift cards, honestly. I just know that it was put on my card.\n\nJudge: Did Macy’s tell you who made these charges?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked if they signed for it, and Macy’s said yes. I asked, “Who?” They said they couldn’t tell me the full name. I asked if they could give me anything, and they gave me the first name: Angela. I asked if I could confirm the last name, and they said if I told them the last name, they could confirm if it was correct. So, I said “Hutchinson.” They said yes.\n\nJudge: Was she an authorized user on your account?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but a long time ago. In 2006, I put her on as an authorized user because we used to date. But after we broke up, around 2008 or 2009, I called Macy’s to have her removed. I know for a fact that I called to have her removed. Nothing ever came up on my account since then, until now.\n\nJudge: Are you in contact with Ms. Hutchinson?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we have a daughter together.\n\nJudge: Have you had financial disputes with her?\n\nPlaintiff: In ways, yes.\n\nJudge: Ms. Hutchinson, what do you have to say about this?\n\nDefendant (Angela Hutchinson): Your Honor, I don’t know what he’s talking about. He said he put me as an authorized user in 2006, but even though I was an authorized user, I couldn’t call in and order a card because I wasn’t the main account holder. That’s impossible.\n\nJudge: Being an authorized user means you can use the card. Are you saying you never used it?\n\nDefendant: I haven’t had a card. I haven’t been around him. He said he took me off the account in 2008. If that’s true, I shouldn’t have been able to do anything.\n\nJudge: Did you go to Macy’s on December 30th and purchase three gift cards?\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: According to Macy’s, you did.\n\nDefendant: That’s not possible.\n\nJudge: Ms. Hutchinson, did you ever receive a new card from Macy’s?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Where were you living at the time of the charge?\n\nDefendant: I had just moved. Was the card sent to my new address?\n\nJudge: Mr. McLoud, do you have any supporting documents?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here’s the police report and the Macy’s investigation results.\n\nJudge: (Reading) “The cards were signed for and delivered to the listed perpetrator, Angela Hutchinson.” So, according to this, the card was sent to and used by you, Ms. Hutchinson.\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, my mother’s name is also Angela Hutchinson. I lived with her before living with Mr. McLoud. If anybody did this, it wasn’t me.\n\nJudge: According to the report, you were in possession of the card and made the charges. Did you know there is a warrant out for your arrest?\n\nDefendant: What? No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Well, there is. The New York City Police Department has you listed as a wanted person. You need to speak to a lawyer and clear this up because this isn’t going away.\n\nDefendant: I was not aware of that.\n\nJudge: Stop talking and listen. One day, you could be dragged out of bed in front of your kids. You don’t want that to happen, so you need to clear this up.\n\nI have to tell you, it’s in your name, you were an authorized user, and Macy’s says you were the one who purchased the gift cards.

{"id": "916", "dialogue": "Judge: John White, you're suing your former girlfriend, Shannon DuII, for $3,544. You say she owes you during the time that you lived together and refuses to repay you. You have a counterclaim against him for $5,000 for rent after he left and for a car of his you used to drive and now you can't, so now you want $5,000 because of that.\n\nAll right, how did you meet?\n\nPlaintiff (John White): Online.\n\nJudge: How soon did you move in together?\n\nPlaintiff: Moved in probably about six or seven months after that.\n\nJudge: All right, so you guys move in together in October 2017, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: Around Thanksgiving, things started going south.\n\nJudge: That quickly?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. Things were good when we first moved in. It was all good. I took out a loan for $4,000.\n\nJudge: What for?\n\nPlaintiff: So that we could get the apartment. It was for the first month, security deposit, and things we needed at the time. Her kids were going to school, so I also got that too. They needed book bags, pencils, paper—everything they needed.\n\nJudge: How old are your kids?\n\nDefendant (Shannon DuII): 17 and 9.\n\nJudge: 17 and 9. Whose name is tattooed on your arm?\n\nDefendant: My little one. The other one is on my back.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. I just want to make sure we're treating them fairly and that it wasn't some ex-boyfriend. Would that be regret?\n\nDefendant: (Laughs)\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: We were sitting on the couch one day and just playing Yahtzee on our phones, just normal stuff. When we got together, I said I didn't want her ex-boyfriend around, none of that. Then his face popped up from the phone.\n\nJudge: Is that the father of one of the children?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: His face popped up on her phone, and I was like, \"What was that?\" And she swiped it real quick. We started fighting, and then after that, it just went south.\n\nJudge: Did she show it to you and tell you what it was?\n\nPlaintiff: She told me later, but she didn’t show it to me.\n\nJudge: You didn’t say, \"Let me see that?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I did.\n\nJudge: And she wouldn’t show it to you?\n\nPlaintiff: No. And then Thanksgiving came, and I found out she was going to his house while I went to my parents' house to celebrate Thanksgiving. So I just kept it hush, and then around Christmas time, she ran off. We got in a fight, she ran off to his house, disappeared, and—\n\nJudge: Okay, so you guys break up. When do you break up?\n\nPlaintiff: December.\n\nJudge: But you continue to live there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How many months did you continue to live there?\n\nPlaintiff: Till March. End of March.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you’re broken up, you're back with your ex, and you're still living in the same place because you have a lease together. So how does it come to a head that you end up leaving?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, we got in a fight over the car.\n\nJudge: Tell me about the car arrangement between you two.\n\nPlaintiff: I had a truck that broke down, and I ended up buying a Ford F-150.\n\nJudge: Okay. The Ford was in whose name?\n\nPlaintiff: Technically, it wasn’t in anyone’s name yet because I didn’t fill out the title.\n\nJudge: Who had the title?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so nobody’s name.\n\nJudge: You bought it and didn’t register it?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t have the money to. It was just parked and sitting in the driveway.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you were sharing the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So there’s another car—the Nissan Altima. Who does that belong to?\n\nPlaintiff: Me.\n\nJudge: Is it in your name?\n\nPlaintiff: It is.\n\nJudge: All right, what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: She takes off for work one day after we got in a fight. She was in a screaming match with me through text, telling me to get out. I don’t want to see you. So I decided I just need my car. She disappears, and me and my sister meet up at her ex-husband’s house where we find it. I call the cops so they come and see it, get the paperwork, and they give me the car. I go home, and they tell me to leave for the night. During that night, she stole the title to my truck, signed it to herself, and I was forced to give my key over to that.\n\nJudge: You’re suing for $2,000, half of the loan that you took out since it was all spent on the house. And according to you, it’s 50/50. You’re also suing for half of the cable bill and half of the utility.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So now you have a counterclaim against him for rent from April through October. You’re living there now with the new guy?\n\nDefendant: No, I’m living there by myself.\n\nJudge: Just you and your son?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But you agree you kicked him out?\n\nDefendant: He made it unlivable.\n\nJudge: If you kick him out, how are you suing him for rent?\n\nDefendant: Well, because he never contacted the landlord to get himself taken off the lease.\n\nJudge: The landlord’s not going to agree to that. If I’m a landlord and I can sue two people for rent if they stop paying, why would I agree to only sue one person for rent?\n\nDefendant: I can't sue the lease.\n\nJudge: You kicked him out. You told the police, \"I don’t want him here,\" and then he left. How is it that you would ever be entitled to get rent?\n\nDefendant: He also owes me $4,000 for the Nissan.\n\nJudge: That is in his name, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Tell me about that.\n\nDefendant: He basically begged me to take over car payments on the Altima because he didn’t want to ruin his credit by having a voluntary repo.\n\nJudge: Did she put $1,500 down on the car?\n\nPlaintiff: She did.\n\nJudge: Was she making the payments?\n\nPlaintiff: Not after September.\n\nJudge: Did you make any car payments after September?\n\nDefendant: Not to the company.\n\nJudge: To who?\n\nDefendant: To him.   Judge: So you were giving him the money directly instead of paying the finance company?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And did he use that money to pay off the car loan?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you’re saying he owes you for the Nissan. What is your claim exactly? That he took the car back?\n\nDefendant: Yes. I was driving it, and then he took it back. Now I don’t have a car, and I had put money into it.\n\nJudge: But the car is in his name.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you were making payments for a car that legally belonged to him?\n\nDefendant: Well, yeah, because he told me he was going to transfer it over to me.\n\nJudge: Did you ever sign anything saying that?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did he ever put the title in your name?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Then why did you think you were entitled to the car?\n\nDefendant: Because we had an agreement.\n\nJudge: An agreement that wasn’t in writing and never actually went through.\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: So your claim is that because you were paying for the car and then he took it back, you should get $4,000?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because I put money into it.\n\nJudge: But it was never your car.\n\nDefendant: But I was making the payments.\n\nJudge: I understand that, but legally, it was still in his name. You were basically paying for something that wasn’t yours. That was a choice you made. If he had transferred the title to you and then taken it back, you might have a case. But he never did that.\n\nDefendant: I still think it’s unfair.\n\nJudge: Maybe, but unfair doesn’t always mean illegal. Now, let’s get back to his claim. You admit that he took out the loan to help pay for the apartment, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you were both living there?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So why shouldn’t you be responsible for half of it?\n\nDefendant: Because he took the loan out in his name. I never agreed to pay it back.\n\nJudge: But you benefited from it.\n\nDefendant: Yes, but that was his decision.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say, “I’ll help you pay it back”?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever make any payments toward it?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, let’s talk about the utilities and cable. You agree you were both using them?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But you didn’t pay half?\n\nDefendant: No, I paid what I could.\n\nJudge: Did you ever agree that you’d split them 50/50?\n\nDefendant: Not really. It was just understood that he would take care of it.\n\nJudge: Understood by who?\n\nDefendant: By both of us.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying he voluntarily took on those expenses?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you never said you’d pay him back?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: All right. Here’s what I’m going to do. For the plaintiff, I’m awarding him half of the utility and cable bills, because those were shared expenses. But I’m not awarding him half of the loan, because there was no agreement that she would help pay it back.\n\nFor the defendant, I’m dismissing her counterclaim for rent because she kicked him out. And I’m also dismissing her claim for the car because it was never in her name.\n\nFinal ruling: Plaintiff is awarded $544 for utilities and cable. Defendant gets nothing.

What I am asking for is something different. When you would make her a loan, how would you document it? Because I know you didn’t write it down contemporaneously on this piece of paper. You wrote this all at once. So I’m trying to figure out how you kept track of these purported loans.\n\nPlaintiff: When she would borrow, I would know.\n\nJudge: Where did you write it down? Because this isn’t it.\n\nPlaintiff: I wrote it down. I just know when someone borrows money from you.\n\nJudge: Right, but you didn’t actually keep track of this stuff, did you?\n\nPlaintiff: I did, but—\n\nJudge: Then how do you come up with the figure of $500?\n\nPlaintiff: She was supposed to pay me back when she got her taxes. But she went to jail and had to bail herself out. When she got out, she said she’d pay me next year. I waited patiently. Then I called her, and she texted me, “You’ll get the money when I get the money.”\n\nJudge: Show me the text.\n\nDefendant: I never actually borrowed $500 per se, but sometimes she’d give me $20 or $40 for Pampers, milk, or whatever.\n\nJudge: Did you ever tell her you’d pay her back?\n\nDefendant: No, I felt like if I did owe her money, she got it back already.\n\nJudge: How?\n\nDefendant: There was a point in time where she was watching my children and getting paid by the government, but she wasn’t really watching them. She was just collecting $800 a month.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s a lie!\n\nDefendant: I have paperwork stating I stopped working December 26th. She got paid for January and February when she wasn’t even watching my kids.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you report that?\n\nDefendant: I thought they had stopped the checks. Until I got a letter, I didn’t know.\n\nJudge: So you were cheating childcare benefits?\n\nDefendant: No, I was receiving assistance to look for a job.\n\nJudge: But you weren’t looking?\n\nDefendant: No, I was unemployed.\n\nJudge: Okay, do you owe her money?\n\nDefendant: No, I don’t feel like I do.\n\nJudge: You think you don’t owe because she was getting benefits?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: When you loan money to a relative, do you sign an IOU?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Should you? Yes. It’s like loaning money to anyone else. If you don’t have proof, there’s no claim.

There’s no documentation. How do you expect me to determine the exact amount owed?\n\nPlaintiff: My nephew knows she owes me.\n\nJudge: But I don’t.\n\nJudge: You’re suing for a round number.

{"id": "1016", "dialogue": "Judge: Juliet, you're suing Latoya for $1,424.29 in damages that she did to your brand spanking new Subaru. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: On January 9th, we were going to make a right turn onto the expressway. There's no light, but you have to wait because of the oncoming traffic.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So we're just waiting. My husband is there talking, my daughter is in the back seat, and we felt a hit. And of course, it wasn’t like a major thing. I looked in the rearview mirror, and she looked up. I don’t know what she was doing, but she looked up. I was very upset—the car was just a little over a week old. I came out and said, “You just hit my car.”\n\nJudge: Are you telling me that you know where her eyes were before she hit you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don't know where her eyes were, but when I looked in the rearview mirror, she looked up. I don’t know what she was doing.\n\nJudge: But you don't know how the accident happened? You just know that you got hit from behind?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: So we were coming out of the side street, and there were vehicles—a truck and a bus—parked along the service road, so you couldn't really see until you merged out.\n\nJudge: Yeah, you have to roll out a little bit.\n\nDefendant: Right. So she rolled out, and I was assuming she was going to keep going.\n\nJudge: Well, that's why you can't be riding on someone's behind like that. You're supposed to be far enough back that if you make that mistake, you have time to stop without hitting them, right?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: Okay, so now go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: I was upset. I came out and said, “You just hit my car.”\n\nJudge: Do you think she did that on purpose?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, no, I don’t think so, but it was an accident.\n\nJudge: I understand that. But what was her response?\n\nPlaintiff: She said, “Don’t scream at me, don’t scream. Let’s move the car.” But I wanted to take pictures before moving the car.\n\nJudge: I don’t care. I’m telling you right now, you never move the cars until you’ve taken pictures and a video. I don’t care if the law says you have to move the cars—you will in 10 seconds. You will do it after you take pictures and video because what’s going to happen is that somebody’s going to testify later that “Nah, it didn’t happen that way.” I’m not saying you will, I’m just saying that’s what you do when you’re in an accident.\n\nPlaintiff: So, we came out, and it started getting heated because she wanted me to move the car, and I didn’t want to. I wanted to take pictures. I was fumbling with my phone, trying to call 911, but I didn’t realize it was still hooked up to the Bluetooth in my car, so I couldn’t hear them, and they couldn’t hear me.\n\nJudge: I just don’t understand why it has to be so heated.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I was upset.\n\nJudge: I didn’t say I don’t understand why you’re upset. You have a brand-new car that got hit—I understand that you are upset. Have you ever had an accident?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, once before, with a sanitation truck.\n\nJudge: Have you ever had an accident that was your fault?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Have you ever done anything wrong in your life?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay...\n\nJudge: I just don’t understand how something that is an accident has to end up being so heated and unpleasant. But go on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well...\n\nJudge: Do you have the video of the heated argument?\n\nPlaintiff: I did, but I didn’t want to bring it.\n\nJudge: Of course not. It makes you look bad.\n\nPlaintiff: No, it doesn’t make me look bad. I wasn’t even on the video.\n\nJudge: That’s why I want to see it!\n\nPlaintiff: The video was more of her...\n\nJudge: Why can’t I have any fun?\n\nPlaintiff: So I took pictures and videos, and then when the police came—\n\nJudge: You sent them away?\n\nPlaintiff: No, we didn’t send them away. The police came. My husband actually helped diffuse the situation because I was upset.\n\nJudge: You have to calm down. It’s an accident. That’s putting bad juju in the world, and one day, you or your daughter or your husband will have an accident, and someone’s going to start screaming at you. It’s unnecessary. But let’s move on.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t the police file a report?\n\nPlaintiff: She asked them not to.\n\nJudge: The police only walk away if both sides agree not to do a report.\n\nDefendant: The police came and told me she wanted to take the car back to her dealer to see if there was damage underneath.\n\nJudge: Are there visible damages?\n\nDefendant: Based on the light tap that happened, it looks like just a print.\n\nJudge: Is this your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: That’s visible damage.\n\nDefendant: The police are the ones who told me to take it in to check if there was internal damage.\n\nJudge: I’ve been doing this all my life—police don’t walk away unless both sides agree to handle it themselves.\n\nJudge: Now, she expects you to pay for the damage. Why don’t you?\n\nDefendant: I filed a claim with my insurance company. They contacted hers. I also asked her to meet me at the precinct to file a report, and I offered for her to get another estimate.\n\nJudge: What did your insurance company decide?\n\nDefendant: They told me they weren’t taking liability.\n\nJudge: Because your insurance lapsed.\n\nDefendant: No, I have active insurance.\n\nJudge: Your insurance company says otherwise.\n\nDefendant: I just paid my insurance.\n\nJudge: Here’s a letter from your insurance company stating, “We have completed our investigation—there is no coverage.” That sounds like a lapse.\n\nDefendant: I still have active insurance.\n\nJudge: You should check that. Now, the estimate says that the damage to the bumper can’t be smoothed out, so it needs to be replaced. That’s what Subaru told her.\n\nDefendant: But she told the police she wasn’t worried about the damage!\n\nJudge: It doesn’t matter. She can change her mind. Why would she tolerate damage on her brand-new car?\n\nJudge: I find that the estimate of $1,424.29 is legitimate.

{"id": "331", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff loaned the defendant money for a big warehouse party, but the cops shut it down because it was too noisy, and the defendant stiffed him. But the defendant says the party was on 420, and he didn't know about the whole pot day thing. He says the plaintiff actually stole all the money. It's the case of \"Let's Be Blunt.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Michael, you are suing Ankit Patel for $2,590 that you say he owes you on the loan portion of a business agreement that you had with him. According to you, you do not owe that money to him because it was entirely an investment, and both of you lost money. Okay, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Ankit and I met in late 2011 in the fall. We were introduced through a friend, and we started talking about possibly doing this nightclub-style event together. This event would be dancing, drinking, live DJs, etc.\n\nJudge: And why were you talking about that?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): I had previously been involved in a similar type of event. Ankit approached me because he wanted me to help manage his event.\n\nJudge: And the event you had been involved in, was it to make money or just to have a party?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Kind of both.\n\nJudge: And did you make money?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Yes.\n\nJudge: How much?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): About $1,000.\n\nJudge: Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): So we were talking back and forth for several months. Ankit was trying to figure out the correct time to do it and was getting everything together. We were just trying to sort everything out. After several months of negotiations, eventually, on April 5th, we met.\n\nJudge: Originally, it was going to be in December of 2011, but then you couldn’t get it together in time?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Correct.\n\nJudge: So then the date for the party was chosen to be April 20th?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Yes, which happens to be my brother’s birthday.\n\nJudge: And 420... What is it? Pot day?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): Yes, pot day.\n\nJudge: National pot day or worldwide pot day?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): I’m going to go with worldwide. I don’t know.\n\nJudge: I don’t know either. All right, you both probably know and won’t tell me. Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): So we met, signed a contract, and I gave him a check for $3,000. In the stipulations of the contract, it was agreed that if the party was not profitable, Ankit would pay me back the initial loan, as well as 10% interest. If it was profitable, we would split the profits 20% to 80%.\n\nJudge: Now that doesn’t sound like a very good business deal for you.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): I gave out the loan for three reasons: one, because I liked Ankit and wanted to help him; two, because there was a significant chance we would make some money; and three, because it was fun.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me see the contract.\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): (Hands over the contract.) I also have the copy of the check here.\n\nJudge: (Reads contract.) You should always put “loan” on the memo line if it’s a loan. All right, then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): The night of the event, about an hour in, the police responded to a noise complaint and shut it down.\n\nJudge: Why did they shut it down?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): We had liquor without a license. We had a full bar and were charging people an entrance fee.\n\nJudge: Okay, so they closed you down because you weren’t allowed to sell liquor without a license. How many people showed up?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): 30-50 people.\n\nJudge: And how many were you expecting?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): 600-700.\n\nJudge: What did you do when the police came?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): I left with everyone else but came back 20-30 minutes later when the coast was clear.\n\nJudge: How much money was at the door?\n\nPlaintiff (Michael): $410.\n\nJudge: Ankit, you said there was more?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): I wasn’t handling the money. Someone else was, but I don’t remember who.\n\nJudge: That’s not evidence. Do you have proof the amount was wrong?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): No.\n\nJudge: Then why aren’t you paying him?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): Because I felt like he didn’t do as much as he said he would. Also, he took all the money and left.\n\nJudge: But you signed a contract stating the $3,000 was a loan. Why aren’t you paying him?\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): I thought he would help more with organizing things. He left during the police raid and only came back for his projector.\n\nJudge: But the contract is clear. You owe him the money.\n\nDefendant (Ankit Patel): I just don’t think it’s fair.\n\nJudge: That’s not how contracts work.

{"id": "671", "dialogue": "**Transcript of Courtroom Proceedings**\n\n**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Clint Martin. He says he hired the defendant to repair his air conditioning unit, and the technician was rude to his wife, made her cry, and they almost got into a fistfight over it. Bottom line: they made repairs that weren’t needed, he wasted his money, and he’s suing them for a refund of the $1,700 he’s owed. These are the defendants, Allison and David Ary. Allison says they fixed the guy’s AC unit, got paid, and everything was working perfectly. When the unit stopped working again, David discovered they hadn’t changed the filter and it was clogged. The plaintiff grabbed David by the neck, pinned him up against the wall, and physically assaulted him. Once that happened, she refused to send anyone over there again. And here they are. They’re accused of letting things get hot.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hand.\n\n(Plaintiff and Defendants raise their hands.)\n\n**Judge:** Please be seated. Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Clint Martin, you are suing Clean and Green Air Conditioning—I love that name, Clean and Green Air Conditioning—for $1,700. That includes $1,400 for the compressor and $300 for two service calls because, according to you, they did not fix the problem. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Absolutely. In the summer, May 31st, the AC was blowing some hot air. Unfortunately, it was my wife’s vacation time. She works for the Post Office; she’s in the heat every day. So in South Florida, you have to have air conditioning. It’s not a luxury.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, you got to have it.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Exactly. So I called Dave because I’ve used him before. I’m a plumbing contractor, and I’ve recommended him before in the past. Never had any problems. Felt very safe. He came by and said, “Clint, no problem. It’s a little bit low on Freon, we’ll jack it up, everything will be good to go.”\n\n**Judge:** And you got charged how much for that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** $150.\n\n**Judge:** $150 for the service call. So you paid for the Freon?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, of course.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And then, shortly after, a couple of days passed by, it was blowing hot air again. He came back out and said, “Oh, well, this time, an electrical component—I didn’t notice, but the contacts in there don’t look too good, and the coil is a little bit dirty. So I’m going to clean that up.” And he showed me some electrical component. Then he said, “Well, since I was just here, I’m only going to charge you for the part.” So, me being in the trades, I said, “Absolutely not, I pay you for the whole service call and the part.” So he left. Again, it was blowing cold, and then again, it got hot.\n\n**Judge:** How soon?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Just, uh, no more than a couple of days. Right? And hot air again. So I called him up and I’m like, “Dave, look, I’m not an AC guy, I’m a plumbing guy. You gotta come by here and straighten it out. If I need a new system, whatever it is, it has to be done. My wife’s on vacation, you know, can’t have it 95 degrees in the house.”\n\n**Judge:** He comes out?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So he says, “Now that I’m here, I noticed the fan motor is acting sporadic. I didn’t see that before, so I’m going to change that.”\n\n**Judge:** So he changes the fan motor?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Did he charge you for that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** No charge for the fan motor. Okay, so he’s trying to make it work.\n\n**Plaintiff:** It started to blow hot again a couple of days later.\n\n**Judge:** Yes?\n\n**Plaintiff:** And then he says, “Well, Clint, the compressor’s bad.” And I said, “Well, how much is that?” He says, “$1,400.” And I said, “But if I put $1,400 into this old system, am I going to get a couple of years out of it? Because, you know, I just did my driveway, I’m in contract to do a bunch of expenses.” He says, “Clint, 30 years of experience, you’re good for a couple of years, no problem.”\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so then?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So then he puts in a new compressor.\n\n**Judge:** He puts in a new compressor. You pay $1,400. And what happens?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Hot air again.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And now?\n\n**Plaintiff:** My wife is freaking out on me.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah. You’re a plumber, you’re in the trade, why can’t you get this done right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right! She said, “You’re the one who recommended this guy.”\n\n**Judge:** I’m surprised you didn’t get a shoe in the butt.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I’m surprised I didn’t either.\n\n**Judge:** Here’s what I want to ask you. Have you had the thing fixed?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Absolutely.\n\n**Judge:** Can I see the repair bill from the new AC guy? Because what did they do? Because if you already had a compressor, what did they do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I called a big company to come out and paid them for a service call to troubleshoot everything.\n\n**Judge:** What did they say?\n\n**Plaintiff:** This company comes out with a leak detector. The gentleman is there for, no lie, 10 minutes after he had the lid off of there, and he finds leaks in the coil.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so he found leaks in the coil. I need to hear from the defense. What do you say happened?\n\n**Defendant (David Ary):** The whole story’s backward. His fan motor was an intermittent problem that was undetectable. Every time I went there, the fan motor worked fine. It was only after I changed the compressor, which was shorted and had blown fuses, that I discovered the fan motor was also bad. Once I replaced the compressor, it was running fine. He called me that night, and I came back again. Eventually, I found the filter clogged, which was likely the root cause of the overheating issue all along.\n\n**Judge:** You are an AC guy. Why wouldn’t you have checked the filter first?\n\n**Defendant:** I asked his wife about it, and she said Clint takes care of it, so I left it at that. I should have checked it myself.\n\n**Judge:** That was a big mistake. Bottom line, I order you to return the $1,400 and pay the court costs.\n\n**Defendant:** Not happy, but I had no chance to make the job whole after being physically attacked.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I never attacked him.\n\n**Judge:** Case closed.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal,minimization"}
{"id": "257", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hand.\n\nJudge: Samuel Romero, you are suing your former girlfriend, Hilda Hernandez, for $2,500, the value of a truck that you, according to you, loaned her, let her drive, and she totaled. While you were dating. You're no longer dating, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: All right, tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: On October 19th, I was sick with the flu in her house, and she took my truck that morning because she didn’t want to take the bus to go to work. Later on that day, she was calling my phone, but my phone was off. Then she had her friend knock at the door, and that’s when I found out my truck was totaled.\n\nJudge: Let me just ask you in a moment how the accident happened, but how long had you two been dating?\n\nPlaintiff: On and off for like a year.\n\nJudge: Okay. What happened the day of the accident?\n\nDefendant: The day of the accident, I was driving from work and I was rushing home. It was a rainy day. I was trying to make a right turn, and I lost control. I hit a pole, and the truck was totaled. And that was the end of it. We moved on with our relationship. We were having our problems.\n\nJudge: So you broke up?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, we broke up at the end of November 2011.\n\nJudge: Up to this point in time, had there been any discussion by him that you owed him money for the truck?\n\nDefendant: No, not at all.\n\nJudge: Because according to you, the truck was yours?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it was. He gave me the truck. I have two voicemails right here where he is saying himself clearly and specifically that it was my truck.\n\nJudge: When do these voicemails happen?\n\nDefendant: November 28th, 2011.\n\nJudge: But by then, the car is totaled. So why did they happen?\n\nDefendant: Let me explain. The reason why is because I had a feeling—there were some things that had already happened in our relationship. Since he made a statement to the officer, and I still kept that inside me, I asked him, I believe November 27th, that I needed a notarized letter stating that that was my car. What happened was that morning, supposedly he was looking for—he was going to an interview, so he couldn’t write the notified letter. When he did call me, I didn’t pick up purposely because I wanted to make sure that if he was going to leave some type of evidence, it was going to be on this voicemail. And he sure has. I have it right here.\n\nDefendant: Plays voicemail \"That truck was yours, you understand? Because you always wanted a car, right? That truck’s yours. Because it was under my name, the title had everything under my name, but I was going to switch everything to you. Because I told you that it’s your car.\"\n\nJudge: Why did you leave that message for her? What did you think she wanted it for?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason why I left that message, Your Honor, is because she had a ticket because she was unlicensed.\n\nJudge: You didn’t have a license?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: And why are you letting her take your truck?\n\nPlaintiff: She took my truck all the time.\n\nJudge: No, no. You said she took your truck because she didn’t want to take public transportation to work. You knew she took your truck?\n\nPlaintiff: I was very sick.\n\nJudge: You were very sick, so she was driving? I have affidavits from a bunch of her family members saying that she drove that truck all the time. Why were you letting her drive your truck when she had no license?\n\nDefendant: I deserve that.\n\nJudge: You both deserve it. What are you both thinking? It’s under your name, so she runs over a truckload of nuns, and you're going to get sued. You understand?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Who pays? Him or her, for this truck?\n\nDefendant: He has to pay. You can’t let someone who doesn’t have a license drive your car.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but she knew she didn’t have a license.\n\nDefendant: No, but he’s the one with the license, and he has the insurance and stuff.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but she was driving the car. He’s legally liable. He knew she didn’t have a license.\n\nDefendant: But she knows it too.\n\nJudge: Too bad. All right, so you end up breaking up when?\n\nDefendant: End of November 2011. Things started falling apart. He got a little violent twice already. First time, he hit me.\n\nJudge: How?\n\nDefendant: We were in front of his grandmother’s house, and he was smoking something. I pushed it out of his hand, and he choked me and put me on the floor.\n\nJudge: He choked you and put you on the floor?\n\nDefendant: Yes. That was the first time.\n\nJudge: Did he get arrested?\n\nDefendant: No. Because we both got into it. He hit me, and I hit him. He destroyed my DVD player, my kids' DVD player, my Blackberry. He took my big screen TV and threw it on the floor.\n\nJudge: And that was the breakup?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: How did he take the breakup?\n\nDefendant: He tried to be nice about it at first, then he got angry. He was in denial. I had to get a restraining order. I changed my phone number, relocated, changed my kids' school.\n\nJudge: Do you have a criminal case pending?\n\nDefendant: Yes, harassment and other charges.\n\nJudge: Here’s my ruling. You have an unhealthy obsession with her. You need to move on. There is a restraining order. If you violate it, you go to Rikers. As for the truck, based on your voicemail, I cannot rule in your favor.

{"id": "9", "dialogue": "Judge: You've relied quite a number of times on the government's apparent concession that the 100 percent case would come out your way.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: I took the government to be hedging on that question. I'll just tell you. We'll find out soon enough. But, if the government is not, in fact, taking the position—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —that you took about the 100 percent case, what changes in your argument?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't—\n\nJudge: I mean, how much of your argument relies on that supposed concession?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm not trying to rely on the concession as such. And I—I think you're right, there's a little bit of hedge in the brief fairly, so you can ask him, but I think it is—is a correct statement of law regardless of who says it or why, that—that saying everyone in this position has the mens rea is the equivalent of saying the defendant in the courtroom has the mens rea. It is a class of people that necessarily includes the defendant.\n\nSo there's really only two things you have to decide in this case, Judge. That's the first thing, is that when you move from the defendant to a class of people, including the defendant, whether you're still within 704(b), the answer is yes.\n\nAnd the second question is whether, if that opinion is stated in probabilistic terms instead of absolute terms, you're still within 704(b). We say yes.\n\nAt that point, you're done and you can leave for another day modus operandi versus direct statements of mens rea because, you know, you have a direct statement of mens rea here.\n\nJudge: Another judge?\n\nJudge: Just wanted to explore a little bit further your response to the previous question.\n\nThe 80 percent—he comes in and testifies, 80 percent know, but admits that he doesn't know about the defendant. How is that evidence in court in the first place?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That—that's what I was trying to say, Judge. I think that if the—if the expert disclaimed any knowledge whatsoever about this defendant and—and any inference that might be drawn from his overall experience or from his probabilistic opinion, then I think the plaintiff's lawyer would rise to object and have a very good ground to exclude that opinion.\n\nBut that's not what happens here.\n\nIf it's the only reason—\n\nJudge: Whether it comes out on direct or cross, it wouldn't make any difference.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right.\n\nJudge: He shouldn't be in court.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The only reason the government is offering this testimony is because the expert is implicitly saying, I believe this defendant probably falls within the group. There's no disclaimer here that the expert is offering. And that's the whole point of the testimony.\n\nAnd if—and if—\n\nJudge: So, if we're—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —if I could say one other thing, Judge?\n\nJudge: Please.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is underscored by—by the agent's answers on cross-examination that there's only three possibilities that I'm aware of where the defendant does not know they have drugs, and those possibilities are all different from this case.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, when you add that all up, the expert is effectively saying, not just most people, but this person by logical implication knew she had drugs.\n\nJudge: Correct. And—and—and so, in this case, the only implication is she knew.\n\nIn the other cases we've been discussing, the 80 percent—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: —and I don't know, then you've got a Daubert problem possibly and we're going to have to tackle that in the next case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right. This is the easier case in that sense too. It's not just a most case. It's a most and the only situations I can think of are something else, so, therefore, you get to all by the totality of the agent’s testimony.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Were it down the other road, we're going to have a bunch of Daubert questions. We're also going to have how much probability is enough probability questions too.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You—you—you could. I think—I think the better rule there is that when it comes to Rule 704(b), any opinion of any proffered—\n\nJudge: No, I understand your view. But if you should lose—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah. Yes, we would.\n\nJudge: —we're going to have Daubert questions—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: —and we're going to have probabilistic questions about how much probability is enough.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Exactly. Ninety-nine percent, I'm virtually certain, but I can't guarantee, all these kinds of verbal formulations would be borderline cases.\n\nJudge: Another judge?\n\nJudge: On the text of the rule, that seems to be a problem for you just in my view. And then you rely heavily on the government saying: Well, even though the text only says that it prohibits expert testimony that this defendant had knowledge, that may also prohibit testimony that all defendants in the class always have knowledge. And you seize on that, understandably.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: But then the key move in your argument, I think, is that \"always\" means the same thing as \"usually,\" and that's just not true.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh, I agree, that's not true. So there's—there's two steps, Judge. So the first is whether the defendant, to use the text of the rule, covers a class of people including the defendant. And I think the answer is yes.\n\nAnd I can just give you a couple more examples.\n\nIf somebody—if somebody was trying to figure out what a member of this Court thought and somebody answered, well, Supreme Court Justices always think X, that would be a statement about whether that particular justice had a particular state of mind.\n\nAnd then the second step is whether the \"always\" versus \"probably\" matters. It matters in some sense. It's a degree of certitude.\n\nBut, to go back to the text of the rule, it is still an opinion about whether that justice has something in her mind.\n\nSo to say if you're trying to figure out what some justice thinks and somebody says, justices usually think X, that is a statement about whether the justice has a particular state of mind.\n\nNow it's not absolute, but it goes to the nature of expert testimony.\n\nJudge: It's not—how is testifying that usually, how is that an opinion about whether the defendant did have a mental state?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It—it's opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state. So did or did not covers the full scope.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I think an opinion can be absolute or it can be probabilistic.\n\nTake the opinion—take the example we give in our brief where a therapist, after interviewing a patient, says: People don't usually have trouble getting out of bed unless they're depressed.\n\nWell, that's not a direct statement about that individual, but in context, we understand it to be saying, I think you're depressed.\n\nYou know, we've talked a lot this morning, Judge, about the nature of expert testimony. Expert testimony is rarely absolute. I think a couple of you have pointed that out today. It's usually a probabilistic opinion.\n\nSo, to go back to the Hinckley case, if the expert had said I think John Hinckley was probably insane, he probably couldn't tell right from wrong, that wouldn't be an absolute opinion, but it would have to be covered by Rule 704(b).\n\nAnd the only thing I'm trying to persuade you of today is to say most people in Hinckley's position wouldn't have known right from wrong is exactly the same statement as saying I think Hinckley couldn't tell right from wrong.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So I'm not sure what a lack of history proves.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I'm not sure that that's true. I'd point to the Hatfield Courthouse problems in Portland, Oregon, but let's also look at what the Court has said in so many different cases— in Dubin, in Bond, in Yates, in Kelly, all of these cases.\n\nJudge: But, there, there was a difference in the use of words. Here, you might have a problem with breadth. \"Otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes.\" And the government can address that. But it's not unclear what those words mean.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But the government has no way to address its problem with breadth because—\n\nJudge: Well, we can let them answer that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Okay.\n\nJudge: Any questions?\n\nJudge: If it were just the language in (c)(2) and it simply said, \"whoever corruptly obstructs, influences, or impedes,\" without the word \"otherwise,\" if that were the whole provision, do you acknowledge that the language would then be applied properly to a situation like this?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Unfortunately, no, and the reason for that is that, again, applying all the other canons and applying the whole-text canon and zooming out and looking at 1512, we would submit that (c)(2) should still be read in the way we have suggested that it be read—as something that is an evidence impairment statute. I think also, as I mentioned, the Latin canons, the surplusage problem that (c)(2) would create, all of those would still apply if it sat there by itself without the \"otherwise.\" The \"otherwise\" is the icing on the cake. And, finally, as I mentioned earlier—\n\nJudge: Well, let me just clarify—if you didn't have (c)(1) and only had (c)(2), without the \"otherwise,\" I'm not sure I was clear on that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh, okay. Well, in that case, I think it gets even harder. But I would still say, if we look at what 1512 is about and if we look at this Court's cases on broad, plausible but overly broad readings of criminal statutes not being what the Court adopts when there's an available narrow reading—because Congress can fix that—we would still say that (c)(2) doesn't perform the massive dragnet function that the government submits.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "589", "dialogue": "Judge: I understand, but by operation of the law, don't we have basically the same thing here? Because the second contract is not completely silent.\nThe second contract says forum selection, go to—you know, disputes go to the court.\nAnd I thought that by operation of law, when you don't speak to delegation in a situation like that, the choice is—the delegation is to the court.\nSo that, in effect, even though we don't have those words in the second contract, we basically achieve the same thing.\nAm I wrong about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think you are—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —just a little bit off about that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And the nuance here, I think, is the exact nuance that this Court identified really going all the way back to Prima Paint but through Rent-A-Center itself, where it talked about the fact you can have validity challenges that occur at these different levels.\nSo you can argue that there's some sort of invalidity or some sort of supersession that occurs at the level of the arbitration agreement.\nYou can also have one that occurs at the level of the delegation clause.\nAnd under the severability principle that this Court has consistently applied and that it draws directly from the text of Section 2 of the FAA, the only question here is whether the Respondents' argument addresses the who decides question.\n\nJudge: Can I—keep going.\n\nJudge: No, I'm—it's all right. I'm done.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So the only—only other point I would make that I think is important to understand about this is that a delegation clause by its very nature must reach more broadly than an arbitration agreement, and that's because, when you get to the delegation and you end up in front of the arbitrator, sometimes the answer will be yes, this should be arbitrated; sometimes it will be no, it shouldn't be.\nBut the force of the delegation clause does not turn on the reach of the arbitration agreement.\n\nJudge: So, from the reply brief, page 9, I located a point of possible agreement between you and Respondent on a remand possibility.\nSo you say on page 9 in the reply brief,\n\"Because the Ninth Circuit did not decide whether the sweepstakes official rules displaced the delegation clause, this Court could vacate the judgment below and instruct the Ninth Circuit to apply the FAA's severability rules. See response 58,\" the response to the red brief.\nThe red brief said the Court should remand this case to the Ninth Circuit to more thoroughly consider whether the official rules partially modify the user agreement's delegation clauses they say under non-preempted state laws of contract interpretation.\nAre you all saying the same thing there? And if you both agree that the Ninth Circuit's analysis is wrong, it should be remanded, are we done?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think, Your Honor, that we do both agree that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.\nI think we do both agree that this should be remanded.\nI think we have a disagreement when you get beyond that.\n\nJudge: Understood. Can we just remand and say that's for the Ninth Circuit to figure out in the first instance?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: You can. I think it would be important—\n\nJudge: And if we do that, are we done? (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I think you—I think you could stop there.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think there are some reasons not to stop there and to add a little bit of an explanation.\n\nJudge: But we could. I just want to get the \"could\" and the Respondent. (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. Yes.\n\nJudge: And then tell me why we shouldn't, but I just wanted to get the \"could.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I—I think you could stop there, but in saying that you're remanding the case, I think there are three important principles that the Ninth Circuit went astray on that I would recommend that this Court provide as guidance because this is a situation—successive contracts come up not infrequently in all sorts of commercial settings, consumer settings.\nThe first is that the severability principle applies just as much in a successive contract scenario as it does to a single contract scenario.\nThat means that the court can only entertain challenges directly to the validity or enforceability of the delegation clause itself.\nThe second principle that I think would be important to explain is that delegation clauses can and regularly do direct an arbitrator to resolve disputes about whether an arbitration agreement exists and whether it covers a particular dispute.\nThe third point I think that this Court should make in remanding it is that a court cannot refuse to enforce a delegation clause based on the court's view that a later contract changes the scope of what disputes are arbitrable because, as I said in—in response to your earlier question, the force of a delegation clause does not rise or fall on the scope of—\n\nJudge: These are huge changes.\n\nJudge: Well, you—you do—\n\nJudge: I'm sorry. These are huge changes.\nYou are now creating a whole set of federal rules on what constitutes a superseding agreement or not.\nI don't—we didn't grant cert on that.\nWe granted cert on a very narrow question, and the narrow question was where parties enter into an arbitration agreement with a delegation clause, should an arbitrator or a court decide whether that agreement is narrowed by a later contract that is silent as to arbitration and delegation.\nI don't know whether the silence or not is relevant.\nThe question is what does state law do.\nWe didn't ask for briefing on that.\nThe short answer is the court decides what state law says or doesn't say.\nHere, the Ninth Circuit decided that three years into this litigation, two appeals to the Supreme Court that have been accepted.\nWhy shouldn't we just answer that question? The Court decides it.\nState law may guide the Court in whether there's been a superseding agreement, but we shouldn't be creating federal rules for the state to follow or not follow in interpreting contracts.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, we are not asking for you to create any federal rules in resolving this case.\nThe severability rule is something this Court has applied consistently.\nIt has drawn directly from the text of Sections 2, 3, and 4.\nAnd all we're asking is that in remanding this, you make clear that the severability rule applies here, just as it always does.\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nJudge: I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: I would suppose that your answer could be that it—it depends.\nI mean, simply because there's a subsequent contract that is silent doesn't mean that the delegation clause covers all of that, right?\nYou could have a big enterprise, and you have a delegation clause in a particular arbitration agreement, and there's a contract entered between the same parties somewhere down the line concerning a totally different issue.\nAnd do you think in that situation it still goes to the arbitrator—\n\nJudge: —to decide whether he or she's been delegated the authority to arbitrate that agreement?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I think there is a practical answer to that and there is a doctrinal answer to that.\nThe practical answer is that a party only invokes a delegation clause when it thinks it has a real claim that the dispute is actually subject to arbitration.\nSo—for example, in this case, the Respondents have agreed that absent the rules changing it, their claims are subject to arbitration.\nSo that's the—that's the practical answer.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "251", "dialogue": "Judge: So two responses, Your Honor.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: First, I don't think judicial review of orders concluding withholding-only proceedings is precluded by the Fourth Circuit's reading. The parties have identified various ways by which aliens could obtain review of those orders.\n\nJudge: Let's assume --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They've acknowledged --\n\nJudge: -- the government has kind of disclaimed that now.\n\nJudge: So let's -- if -- if those aren't, let's -- in this hypothetical, just assume those are off the table.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If those are off the table, if those are not valid, then I think this is a unique form of judicial review.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I'm not aware of another one that is like this.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It allows CAT claims to be reviewed but only if you file a petition for review of a final order of removal.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I'm not aware of an -- an analogy to it, but I don't think it would be surprising, if Congress meant to restrict judicial review, that it would do it for these particular classes of aliens, aliens who have been convicted of felon -- felonies and illegal reentrance.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That would not be a surprising class, given Congress's interest in expediting the removal of those aliens.\n\nJudge: Is that consistent with the presumption of judicial review?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, again, front-line position is that I think there are means available to get judicial review.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Setting that aside, I don't think the presumption -- I don't think the Court needs to resort to the presumption, given the plain meaning of the filing deadline.\n\nJudge: Would you say, then, that your argument, maybe not hinges, but is helped significantly by the available of these alternate routes?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think it is helped, but I don't -- I think it's helped, I don't think the presumption needs to be raised at all because I don't think the text is ambiguous with respect to what the meaning of a final -- final order of removal is, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: But if your front-line position is that there is judicial review, even with respect to these people who are in expedited proceedings, if that's your front -line position, isn't it a quite odd way to write a statute to say, yes, you get judicial review, but we're going to set up a 30-day deadline which effectively precludes you from ever getting that judicial review?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I think it wouldn't preclude you from getting the judicial review if these alternative means are available.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would just require you to file the protective petition and hold it in abeyance, which the government represents has been done in the Fourth Circuit since its decision.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And I think this Court has been clear that administrative burden or complexity is not a reason to depart from the plain meaning of the statute.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But I also think there was a good reason for Congress to do it this way.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And I think this relates to the policy consequences of the Plaintiff’s and the government's position.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the Plaintiff’s and the government's position separates administrative finality, on the one hand, from finality for purposes of judicial review, on the other.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And by doing so, they create a risk that aliens can be removed from the country to a third country during withholding-only proceedings without ever having the chance to go into court and get a stay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's a significant policy problem, and that's because, as everyone here agrees, the final administrative removal order is administratively final as soon as it's issued.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That authorizes the government to remove the alien to a third country so long as the government provides notice of that and the alien doesn't have a fear of persecution or torture in that country.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But as long as withholding-only proceedings are ongoing, according to the Plaintiff and the government, there will not be a judicially final order, and so the alien won't be able to go into court and get a stay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's a particularly significant problem because there will be cases in which aliens both want to challenge the validity of their 1228(b) orders and seek withholding relief.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And those aliens will be put to a difficult choice.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They will either need to forgo their withholding proceedings so that they can immediately get judicial review and the stay of their 1228(b) orders, or risk it, go into withholding proceedings knowing that there's a chance they might be removed to a third country before ever having the chance to go into court and get a stay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That cannot happen on the Fourth Circuit's reading because the Fourth Circuit's reading marries administrative finality with finality for purposes of judicial review.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: I thought that there was a stay for the petition for removal when a CAT claim is made --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There --\n\nJudge: -- within the 30-day period.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There is not, Your Honor. And the government explained that, that the government believes itself and does in fact have the authority to a remove an alien to a third country --\n\nJudge: To a third country?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Exactly.\n\nJudge: -- but they said --you forgot the subject to -- subject to notice and an opportunity to file an amended CAT claim on the new designation.\n\nJudge: So it's not an open-ended thing. And you answered the other Judge by saying it makes sense that aggravated felons and people who have come back illegally shouldn't have more -- have expanded appellate rights under CAT.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But the government has conceded that people who haven't had either of those two situations, who have appealed to the Board and -- and are subject to the zipper clause in terms of the 30-day period, the Board not infrequently affirms the petition for removal and remands the petition --the CAT claim. You're saying those people can't appeal either.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Your Honor, I think that, generally in those cases, aliens would have the opportunity to do it, and that's because of the Board's particular remand policy.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So under a 1978 Board decision called Matter of Patel, when the Board remands a case, it's a general or plenary remand that allows reconsideration of any issue on remand, unless the Board --\n\nJudge: But not the petition for review if they've affirmed it.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would allow for reconsideration of the removability decision by the IJ unless the Board expressly limits the remand to that withholding issue.\n\nJudge: Can I go back to the other Judge’s question about the presumption? I guess I don't understand why the text of the statute is not ambiguous concerning the meaning of final order in the expedited removal context.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So two points, Your Honor.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: First, we don't think the presumption comes up so long as these alternative means of getting judicial review are available, like the protective petitions.\n\nJudge: Presumption -- I think the other Judge’s point is the presumption of reviewability helps us interpret statutes, and if the statute's ambiguous, then it kicks in and it has nothing to do with facts on the ground.\n\nJudge: And you -- you can achieve -- skin the cat some other way.\n\nJudge: Do you want to respond to that?\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "242", "dialogue": "Judge: I understand that. That's a different case. What I'm interested in is we had this exact issue in a previous case. That would have seemed to have been the occasion for deciding exactly what you're talking about. But we did not get a court for that. I can think of no other case where the right to have your spouse immigrate to this country has been considered. That's what I'm interested in.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I see. To clarify, that's not the procedural due process right that we're advancing. We do not claim that the petitioner has a right to do what she wants, live with her husband in the U.S., even if her husband is inadmissible. We're merely asking for a reasonable and workable solution, which is that some basis for the denial be given so that we can correct the possibility that there was a mistake.\n\nJudge: No, I'm interested in the liberty interest that requires the procedural right, the underlying liberty interest that we could not find in the previous case. That's all I'm interested in.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I see. In a number of other substantive due process cases, precedent has acknowledged the substantive right to raise a family and establish a home, which certainly has a cohabitational element. The issue of the right to daily personal intimate association was recognized by this Court as a substantive right. Even in the immigration context, at the peak of restrictive immigration policies, the Court acknowledged that a noncitizen had the right to bring their spouse to the country even without the required documentation.\n\nJudge: Well, none of those address the central issue, which is the principle of consular nonreviewability, which seems to be an entirely different order of magnitude than the cases you've cited.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The government raises consular nonreviewability as an exception when the rights of citizens are implicated. If a U.S. citizen has been living with their spouse for years and has tried to go through the legal process, but a denial is given without any explanation, that is the type of case where some level of review is necessary. The Court has previously considered claims asserted by U.S. citizens regarding violations of their personal rights allegedly caused by the government's exclusion of particular foreign nationals. We do not believe the Court would be breaking any new ground by acknowledging that consular nonreviewability does not apply when the liberty interests of U.S. citizens are implicated.\n\nJudge: What more would you be entitled to than what you've already received? I understand the question of the timeliness of the explanation, but what else do you think you're entitled to?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: What we received, what the lower court said was sufficient, is far better than vague explanations.\n\nJudge: But as you said, you’ve already received that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct, after the one-year deadline had passed.\n\nJudge: So you think you're entitled to more just because the deadline had passed?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, but we think we're entitled to a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegation with enough information so that we're not trying to fight back with our hands tied.\n\nJudge: In court?\n\nJudge: Can't you—I'm sorry.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, but if I may, this certainly came up in the earlier discussion.\n\nJudge: I mean, what happens in court then? You say reasonable opportunity to contest. So you can force the government to provide more evidence behind the reasoning, or what happens?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, Your Honor. What we believe is the most appropriate way to proceed is to follow the process used in the domestic context, where a general factual summary of the basis for denial is provided, excluding sensitive national security material. This would allow these cases to be resolved at the agency level instead of leading to prolonged litigation.\n\nJudge: But, counsel, you got that. The lower court said that’s exactly what you received. So why are we here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Because what we're asking for now is the chance to go back to the consulate and try to overcome the denial with the information we now have.\n\nJudge: Okay.

{"id": "622", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-5572, Fischer versus United States.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted 1512(c) in 2002 in the wake of the large-scale destruction of Enron's financial documents.\nThe statute therefore prohibits the impairment of the integrity or availability of information and evidence to be used in a proceeding.\nIn 2002, Congress hedged a little bit and added Section (c)(2) to cover other forms of impairment, the known unknowns, so to speak. It was, after all, the dawn of the Information Age.\nUntil the January 6th prosecutions, Section 1512(c)(2), the \"otherwise\" provision, had never been used to prosecute anything other than evidence tampering, and that was for good reason.\nThis Court has said that \"otherwise,\" when used in a criminal statute, means to do similar conduct in a different way.\nThe government would have you ignore all that or disregard all that and instead convert (c)(2) from a catchall provision into a dragnet.\nOne of the things that that dragnet would cover is Section (c)(1).\nOur construction of the statute at least leaves (c)(1) and (c)(2) to do some independent work.\nThe January 6th prosecutions demonstrate that there are a host of felony and misdemeanor crimes that cover the alleged conduct.\nA Sarbanes-Oxley-based, Enron-driven evidence-tampering statute is not one of them. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: How do we determine what these two provisions have in common? Do we look after the \"otherwise\" or before, and why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We -- you look at before, Your Honor, and you look at the kinds of manner in which documents and records are to be impaired, and then you look after to see what the effect is.\nBut I would submit that the effect is the same, right, in order to cause the impairment of the integrity of the evidence that's to be used in a proceeding or to prevent its availability.\nSo we look back and we look forward.\n\nJudge: Wouldn't it be just as easy to look at (c)(2) and then ask what it has in common with (c)(1) and use (c)(2)'s provisions as a basis for that similarity?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, because (c)(2) speaks to the effect of the actions that the \"otherwise\" clause covers.\nSo, in other words, we look at (c)(1) and we see that Congress is concerned about documents and records and other objects and things that are done to those to impair the integrity of those, and the effect of that is to obstruct.\nAnd so (c)(2) omits that object and verb section.\n\nJudge: But you could just as easily say that Congress is really concerned about things that obstruct, influence, or impede proceedings.\nAnd that's (c)(2). So why isn't that the basis for the similarity?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, because of the presence of the \"otherwise\" provision.\nSo \"otherwise,\" as I mentioned -- and \"otherwise,\" this Court has said, means to do similar conduct in a different way.\nSo what we've got here is -- is the impairment of evidence being done in a different way.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry. I thought it was, yes, doing it in a different way, so let me give you an example.\nThere is a sign on the theater: You will be kicked out of the theater if you photograph or record the actors or otherwise disrupt the performance.\nIf you start yelling, I think no one would question that you can be expected to be kicked out under this policy, even though yelling has nothing to do with photographing or recording.\nThe object that the verb is looking at is the obstruction. It's not the manner in which you obstruct; it's the fact that you've obstructed.\nIsn't that the structure of this provision?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is, Your Honor.\nIt -- it's -- it's in part the structure of the provision.\nBut what -- what your hypothetical omits is that there is a specific reticulation, I guess it's called, of all of the different sorts of things that might be done to evidence to begin with.\n\nJudge: Except that --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There's a long --\n\nJudge: What's fascinating about (1), which is not about (2), is that (1) doesn't require you to have actually impeded the proceeding. (1) requires you to have that intent, but you don't actually have to accomplish the intent.\n(2) requires you to accomplish the intent.\nAnd so that's a very different articulation of what the object of (2) is.\nThe object of (2) is the actual disruption of the proceeding.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I would respectfully disagree because both --\n\nJudge: Well, why? Look at the language.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: \"Alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record.\" I do that in my home, and I do it anticipating that it might be needed.\nAll I have to do is have the intent to impair.\nBy that very language, I don't have to have an actual proceeding that I've impaired.\nOn (2), you need an actual proceeding to impair.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I guess I'm -- I guess I'm a little confused, Your Honor, because, as I read this, I would think that the government would say that any attempt at (1) is also covered by the statute, and I'm not sure that I would disagree.\nSo I'm not -- I don't think that there has to be an actual impairment.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And is it odd -- I mean, just kind of walk me through this double layer thing. I mean, as I understand your argument, it's that 544(b) has a nested cause of action in it under applicable law, so you're standing in the shoes of the creditor pursuing someone under state law.\n\nIf under state law you could recover that money from a governmental entity that would otherwise have state sovereign immunity, then you have a claim that's been nested by virtue of the under applicable law, but because the vehicle through which the trustee is asserting that cause of action is 544(b), you still need a separate abrogation of the state sovereign immunity to move forward and that's the work that 106(a) is doing?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes.\n\nThat's right.\n\nLet me try to say it back to you and see if you think that you agree.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThe work that 106(a) is doing as to 544(b) in that situation is the same work it's doing as to the other avoidance provisions that are referenced in 106(a), which is these are federal code provisions.\n\nThey would not normally apply to a sovereign absent a waiver, abrogation of immunity, so you would, let's say, take 548, the federal fraudulent transfer provision.\n\nNormally, you could bring that against a private party, but there's no indication you could bring that against the United States or against that state sovereign.\n\n106(a) allows the trustee to assert that cause of action against a sovereign, absolutely, the federal --\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- cause of action. You're right to say that the way 544(b) works is by looking to what would have happened under state law, whether there's a viable avoidance action outside state law.\n\nAnd that's where that state's waiver of sovereign immunity comes into being, which is that that state has exposed itself to fraudulent transfer liability in its own courts.\n\nThe trustee can now mirror that inside the bankruptcy.\n\nJudge:\nBut, absent 106(a), under the way that you're viewing this, the trustee could not proceed under 544(b)?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThat's right, and that's the purpose of 106(a)'s waiver as to the 59 provisions.\n\nIt's to allow those federal code provisions to be applied, invoked, enforced against sovereign entities.\n\nThat's the work it's doing.\n\nJudge:\nSo the other side says, well, that's pretty weird because then you're looking for two waivers of sovereign immunity or an abrogation of sovereign -- two abrogations of waiver and an abrogation that you have to double-team in order to go.\n\nYou want to respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes.\n\nThanks.\n\nI don't think that our position is asking for two waivers.\n\nTo the contrary, what our position is resting on the premise of is that when Congress made a provision like 544(b), which turns on liability that exists outside the code, it doesn't mean to affect that by waiving immunity inside the bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nSo we disagree with the premise that Congress wanted to accomplish this thing.\n\nBut you're right to say that if Congress wanted to accomplish it, the way to do it would be it has to do something about 544(b). And the answer would be to alter -- the most obvious answer would be to alter the way 544(b) operates.\n\nAnd instead of operating on the basis of an action that's actually viable outside bankruptcy, which, again, is not our interpretation -- it is the uniform understanding for over a hundred years of 544(b) and its predecessor provisions -- would be, instead of requiring that, it would say something like, in 544(b), transfers to the United States are avoidable to the same manner and the same extent as transfers to a private party, similar to what Congress did in the FTCA context.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Jackson?\n\nJudge:\nI think the thing I found interesting in the exchange you just had with Justice Barrett is that she approached the analysis by starting with 544 and you started with 106(a).\n\nAnd I wonder if that might be the sort of -- to the extent there's any disconnect, and I don't think there is, but the framing is slightly different.\n\nYou say we need the waiver of sovereign immunity to start to allow for the trustee to bring an action.\n\nAnd then, to determine whether or not that action can proceed or is successful or whatnot, you go to 544, which says you have to allow -- the trustee can proceed only to the extent that he could -- that an actual creditor could outside of bankruptcy, and sovereign immunity there can do the work to prevent the trustee from proceeding.\n\nIs that how you're viewing this?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI actually don't think it matters where you start.\n\nI think where --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n--where Justice Barrett started was perfectly fine too.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThis is more just conceptually trying to understand what's going on here as sort of the whole code, what is Congress doing here.\n\nAnd 106(a) absolutely waives immunity as to these federal code provisions.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you do that at the end of the analysis or at the beginning of the analysis.\n\nBut, when it does that, it specifically says it's not altering the substance of those provisions.\n\nSo what do you do as a court adjudicating an action brought under one of these provisions? You go look at what are the substantive terms.\n\nFor most of them, the substantive terms don't implicate something happening outside of bankruptcy.\n\nBut 544(b) works differently, and it's long been understood to work differently.\n\nYou have to go look at what's happening outside of bankruptcy.\n\nAnd nothing in 106(a) suggests that Congress meant to affect what's happening outside of bankruptcy or that requirement that you look to what's happening outside of bankruptcy.\n\nEssentially, what the trustee is asking for here is that when you look at 544(b)'s actual creditor requirement, you close your eyes or you disregard sovereign immunity that hasn't been waived, that continues to exist.\n\nAnd that's where the theory is wrong and it's why the 544(b) claim fails on the merits.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 106 waiver with respect to 544 means that trustees can avoid fraudulent transfers inside bankruptcy even though sovereign immunity applies outside bankruptcy. \"With respect to,\" even read very narrowly, means directly relating to 544.\r\n\r\nAnd the waiver that concededly applies to the trustee's claim has the same direct relationship to the incorporated state law elements.\r\n\r\nNo textual or logical distinction exists between the two.\r\n\r\n106(a)(2) also lets courts hear any issue respecting 544's application to governments, so courts can thus hear these claims without regard to sovereign immunity.\r\n\r\nCongress waived immunity knowing that 544 has always required trustees to step into creditors' shoes under state law.\r\n\r\nBy waiv ing immunity, Congress clearly expected trustees to sue governments by relying on state law.\r\n\r\nCongress could not have plausibly intended to waive immunity only to see it smuggled in through the back door under the guise of applying state law.\r\n\r\nNor is it plausible that Congress has ever waived immunity but only contingent on a second waiver.\r\n\r\nNo such statute exists in the U.S. Code, nor does any statute contain a double waiver.\r\n\r\nCongress spoke expressly when it wanted to give t he IRS special treatment and to make exceptions for fraudulent transfers, but it did neither for the IRS in 544.\r\n\r\nThe government's position overrides these choices and allows the I RS to keep assets that every other transferor would have to return.\r\n\r\nThat result would prevent the trustee from recouping this money and paying it to the bus drivers and the mechanics and the vendors, who certainly gave All Resort more value than the IRS did.\r\n\r\nAll -- the government's position finally --destroys creditor equality.\r\n\r\nWhere governments are creditors, like they are here, the government gets to keep the fraudulent transfer and its share of a much smaller pie.\r\n\r\nI welcome the Court's questions.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Does she not have Article III standing because there's a -- an imminent threat of what she claims is unlawful conduct in the future?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nIt would be no different if she knew that her disease would render her totally disabled and she wanted to enjoin the City from terminating her employment before it did so, when, of course, under Title I, employers are allowed to terminate employees the moment they become unqualified and they can't do the job with or without a reasonable accommodation.\n\nShe would be seeking to enjoin the City from doing something that is not unlawful under the ADA.\n\nIt might be an equal protection violation.\n\nIt might be a breach of contract. It might be all of these other things, but it would not be a violation of Title I of the ADA.\n\nJudge: Well, given her allegations, do you think she has a facially valid breach-of-contract claim?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Absolutely not.\n\nShe -- her -- the -- there is no breach of contract because the policy was changed in 2003, 15 years before she retired.\n\nAnd, under Florida law, governmental employees are permitted to change retirement policies before the rights under them vest.\n\nSo, if we had changed -- we would not have been allowed to change it after she retired.\n\nShe would have had a vested right. But 15 years before she retired, we changed the policy to not treat her worse but to treat her slightly less preferentially than she was already receiving.\n\nBefore the policy change, disability retirees, even if they retired with five or 10 years, were given the same health insurance subsidy as people who worked for 25 years.\n\nSo they were receiving preferential treatment over similarly situated non-disabled employees who had the same amount of years.\n\nAnd then the City changed it to start treating disability retirees more equally with everyone else and said you -- now you also have to work 25 years to get the full subsidy, but, out of compassion, because you were forced to retire due to a disability, we will give you 24 months of the subsidy, whereas we would otherwise give you nothing if you were a non-disabled person.\n\nAnd, uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly how long it takes for a totally disabled person to then become Medicare-eligible and get Medicare insurance.\n\nSo the City bridged that gap between when a disability retiree retires early and the two years that it would take to start getting --\n\nJudge: Can -- can you explain --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: --health insurance under Medicare.\n\nJudge: -- the Medicare insurance and -- and how that works? So, after the two years, someone in this position gets the health insurance benefits that you're giving them for the two years in the interim, correct? Or it's similar.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If they -- if they apply -- if they --\n\nJudge: I mean, I don't know how Medicare matches up with your health insurance benefits.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So a person like the Petitioner who -- who alleges they are totally disabled --\n\nJudge: Or admitted.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- could qualify under Social Security disability.\n\nAnd the Medicare Act says, once you become eligible for Social Security disability because you're permanently disabled, you then become eligible for Medicare Parts A and B.\n\nSo that bridges that gap.\n\nWe pay -- the City paid for her --\n\nJudge: And -- and --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: --health insurance until --\n\nJudge: -- I think --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- those 24 months.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\nI think you were saying the City did that precisely to bridge that gap so that someone who's totally disabled is not left without health insurance --I'm not sure of the \"because\" here, but --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: -- that's what you're representing, I think -- to bridge the gap so that someone's not left without health insurance in that two years.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nBecause, if a non-disabled person were in Petitioner's shoes and retired with only 20 years, they would receive absolutely no health insurance subsidy.\n\nAnd they also, because they're not disabled or totally disabled, would not be Medicare-eligible if they weren't 65.\n\nSo the City continued to treat its disability retirees with preferential treatment over non-disabled employees who were similarly situated with an equivalent amount of years of service.\n\nJudge: The problem with this argument in my mind is who bears the cost. You're saying the public fisc should bear the cost because, in two years, Medicare will pay what we used to pay, correct? Because, under the Medicare Act, they don't --they exhaust private remedies first, and then the public fisc pays?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, there is no requirement that any employer provide health insurance subsidies.\n\nJudge: That we're putting aside.\n\nThat's the nature of the claim here, which is you promised me you would.\n\nAnd assuming that were true, which I know you fight on every level, but assuming you made an explicit promise, I'm going to pay you this amount of money, and then took it away so the public fisc could pick it up, that's what you're doing, is you're saying we're -- this is just always a matter of who's going to pay, us --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, because, if -- if --", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "58", "dialogue": "Judge: How do you respond to the government's suggestion that the NTA is really not central? I mean, the government says we are looking at the statute and it says, you know, we can get an in absentia removal order if we have issued (1) or (2). And so I guess the government's point is that suggests that (1) is really not pivotal in the way that you are putting forward.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that's wrong, Your Honor, for two reasons. The first is that the \"or\" in the in absentia context doesn't define the relationship between (a)(1) and (a)(2). That's done in the statute defining those two provisions. And so, again, to go back to the voter registration hypothetical, you could have a sentence saying, you know, send the voter the primary ballot for the party listed in their voter registration form or their change of party affiliation form. That wouldn't mean that somehow the voter registration form is irrelevant just because you have the word \"or\" in that sentence. And so I think what you have to do is look at paragraphs (1) and (2) and the relationship between them, and it's clear both from the mandatory language of paragraph (1), from the fact that, as this Court explained in Niz-Chavez, it's the one place that tells you all the information you need to defend yourself in a removal proceeding, and the fact that (a)(2) is structured as a change or a supplement, that those two documents are not interchangeable.\n\nJudge: I want to make sure I understand your answer about change. So you're saying that, you know, just because you file a change of party affiliation form doesn't make your initial voter registration valid. I -- I get that. But, in the statute, it says, \"change of time or place of proceedings.\" So it's not, you know, referring generally. I'm just wondering where you get the statutory hook, because that presumes that there is an NTA. But, if it's defective in some way, if, as we take the defect in time and place out of it, why couldn't it be that there is an NTA that's defective in some way, but the statute imposes an obligation on the non-citizen who knows the time and place he's supposed to show up to make an appearance at that proceeding and raise whatever objection there is to the defect?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: And maybe -- maybe the objection -- and I'm thinking of an analogy to a Rule 55 civil default judgment proceeding. It may well be that whatever objection that the non-citizen raises at that point is fatal to the government's case. You know, maybe it's missing some vital piece of information. Maybe it can be remedied if it's omitted the right to counsel by giving him time to obtain counsel. If there's some problem in the description of the charges, the grounds for removal, then maybe the entire thing has to be dismissed and the government has to start again. But why wouldn't it be consistent with the statutory scheme for the non-citizen to have to show up to the removal proceeding and register whatever objection the non-citizen has? I'm not saying that that's right, but it seems to me -- I -- I just want to understand why that's ruled out on your understanding of the statutory language.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor. So the statute doesn't ask about notice generally or notice of the time of the hearing. It asks about notice in accordance with the specific statutory provisions. And that's a contrast to the pre- --\n\nJudge: Or, though, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So that's correct. But our position is that there's been neither a paragraph (1) notice nor a paragraph (2) notice.\n\nJudge: But I guess I don't understand where in the statute you can say there has not been a paragraph (1) notice if there's been a defective paragraph (1) notice? There's been a paragraph (1) notice. And, here, I'm not talking about the blank piece of paper. I'm just saying it's missing some piece of information other than date and time. Why isn't that just a defective NTA?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that's sort of the square holding of Pereira. So, again, Pereira reserved the question of missing other pieces of information, but the statute puts them all on par. And Pereira says it's not just that this is a deficient document. It says no notice to appear has been served, right? That's the language that Pereira was interpreting.\n\nJudge: But stop -- well, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So -- so Pereira is interpreting has a notice to appear been served under paragraph (1). It says no notice to appear has been served if it's missing one of these pieces of information.\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I -- I'm not cutting you off?\n\nJudge: No, I'm done.\n\nJudge: Then I'll jump into that. I have -- I want to follow up on the previous question because there seems to be a difference between a jurisdictional flaw and a claim processing flaw, which is what the government has been calling this. And I do think that we -- you have to address that question. It seems to me that the clear holding of our prior precedents is that it's jurisdictional, that if you don't have a proper notice of appearance, that that's a jurisdictional defect. They can't order you -- they can't invoke the stop-gap rule, but they also can't order you removed until they provide you with the proper document, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that's right. I want to be a little bit careful because I think \"jurisdictional\" is a little bit of a slippery word.\n\nJudge: It is.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: So is using claim processing in this kind of context.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So our position is that if you show up at the hearing, you can say this was defective. And until the government cures that defect, they can't go forward. Congress also provided an express remedy for where there's a defective notice and you're removed in absentia. There is no remedy in the statute for where there's a defective notice and a removal order was entered after a hearing. So we're not saying that someone who attended their hearing, had the chance to object to the notice to appear, and was nonetheless removed gets to reopen because Congress hasn't provided that remedy.\n\nJudge: All right. So --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Congress has, however, in --\n\nJudge: Before we end today, I -- I want to take head-on the draconian consequences that a ruling in your favor that the government is painting, and I want you to answer that.\n\nJudge: We may as well go with that now. (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So -- so two responses, Your Honor, right? So the first is the government came to you in Pereira and Niz-Chavez and also articulated a parade of horribles. And this Court said those sorts of raw consequentialist calculations have no place, particularly where, as noted, those consequences are a function of the government ignoring the text of the statute over many cases and many years. The second is, you know, I -- I -- I don't want to dispute that there will be an increase in the volume of these motions, but I do want to be clear about who exactly has an incentive to file them. Remember, if you win on reopening your in absentia removal order, all you get is another hearing, right, even if you're successful in clearing all the hurdles. And at that hearing, you have to prove that you're able to remain in the U.S. And so, you know, for many, many non-citizens who have no pathway to staying in the United States, it's very unlikely that they're going to come forward and file one of these motions to reopen because the best they get is another hearing.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "889", "dialogue": "Judge: So, if you look at the lower court decisions applying this statutory scheme, not a single one of them actually looked at the text of 2401 or 702. None of them did.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, but what I’m suggesting is that there’s not much in the text to look at. \"Accrues\" just means arises. Now we do have precedent, but that precedent arose in a very different context as to what \"accrues\" meant, so you wouldn’t find a lot looking at this text.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I disagree with that. I think this Court definitively interpreted the phrase \"first accrues\" in Gabelli versus SEC just 11 years ago, and it said, in common parlance, a right first accrues when it comes into existence.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: We made very clear that that was a default rule, a general rule that could be, of course, countermanded by Congress but that also could be countermanded by different circumstances. If you look at the Crown Coat opinion, for example, there’s a very explicit recognition by this Court of the hazards inherent in attempting to define for all purposes when a cause of action first accrues. A word like that should be interpreted in the light of the general purposes of the statute, with due regard to those practical ends which are to be served by any limitation of the time within which an action may be brought. You couldn’t find better language to point to. This is a really different context with really different interests, including reliance interests of many, many parties who are not before the Court. And courts have responded to that and created a different rule which has lasted—this is kind of a revolutionary ask.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We disagree. On Crown Coat, the top-line holding from Crown Coat as we read it is that Congress would not want the statute of limitations to start running until the plaintiff had the opportunity to sue. The language you just quoted, we see that as a recognition that obviously the underlying cause of action accrues differently depending on the type of claim. Torts accrue at different times than breaches of contract. Different torts can accrue at different times. And as far as the purposes of the statute, this Court said in Abbott Laboratories that the purpose of the APA was to embody a presumption of judicial review. So, if we're going to look at the underlying statute and its purposes, I think that cuts our way, not the government's way.\n\nJudge: I thought that we had sort of basic first principles governing statutes of limitations. Ordinarily, we say that a cause of action arises—that is, accrues—when all of the facts necessary to establish the elements of that cause of action have occurred. In a tort situation, when there's a duty, if there's a breach and injury as a result of the breach, those facts have occurred, the cause of action has arisen, and we say the clock starts running at that point because a claim against the defendant can be sustained in court when those facts exist. If that’s right as a first principle, I don’t understand your argument that the cause of action arises when the plaintiff can bring the claim. The law regarding when a plaintiff can bring a claim is something different. But here, we have a cause of action arising out of the final agency action, because that is the point at which a person can sustain a claim against the agency under the APA. Why am I wrong about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: This Court has identified the elements of an APA claim, and it requires a plaintiff who is injured and injured by agency action.\n\nJudge: Where have we said that that was an element? I thought that was just a statement of the statute as to who can bring the claim, not the element of the claim itself—like when the defendant has violated the law.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would point the Court to the Lujan decision, 1990, where it outlines the elements of an APA claim.\n\nJudge: Right. Who has the cause of action? I'm talking about what are the elements of the cause of action. I thought it was that the agency has enacted a final rule that you claim is arbitrary and capricious or not in accordance with the law. Once the agency has done that, we have a cause of action—it has arisen—and then these other elements or aspects of the statute say who is the person who can bring such a claim.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I disagree with that. This Court has said that certainly final agency action is an element of an APA claim, but the other element, as this Court noted in Lujan and Newport News, is that someone must be actually harmed by it—a plaintiff who was harmed by it. Accrual-based statutes are necessarily plaintiff-specific. That’s in their nature. We’re not aware of a statute that uses accrual language or accrual-like language where the statute of limitations starts and ends on the same day for everyone. If that were the case, it wouldn’t be an accrual statute—it would be a statute of repose. Congress certainly knows how to pass statutes of repose, and it didn’t do so when it passed the APA. In 1934, Congress passed a Hobbs Act-like statute for the SEC. It did so again in 1938 for the FTC. And in 1950, it actually passed the Hobbs Act itself. But in between those years, it passed the APA and did not subject it to a repose-based statute of limitations, and it passed Section 2401 two years later. That must have been an intentional choice—APA claims are not subject to the kind of repose that applies to other types of causes of action.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That, by the way, was also codified through binding text. That's 1446. I agree that it goes back longer to cases like St. Paul Mercury. As an aside, I actually think that's a completely defensible interpretation of the old statutory text precisely because Congress understands it doesn't want to blur the line between jurisdictional facts and the merits. We don't want to create the Judge Posner problem where a plaintiff comes into court and loses or wins an amount that's less than the amount in controversy and now we have to --\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- remand for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: Do I understand your -- what you just said to mean that you would win this case even if 1367 had never been enacted?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think that I would win this case if 1367 hadn't been enacted and we were still in a more common law regime and this issue were squarely presented to the Court for the first time. Cohill had this issue obliquely presented. Yes, there was an amended complaint. But the party presentation rule should matter. No one made that fact relevant for the Court's consideration. You could have considered it sua sponte because it went to jurisdiction, but no one did. And this Court has pointed out before that drive-by jurisdictional rulings don't have any precedential effect. The reason you had to say that is sometimes, even though you would like to avoid it, you issue drive-by jurisdictional rulings.\n\nJudge: Why --why -- why -- why would we say Cohill addressed this? As I understand it, in -- the question there was whether to remand or dismiss, and this -- this issue wasn't presented to the Court at all.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I completely agree with it. It was not presented to the Court. The facts of Cohill, though, I have to say in the -- in the spirit of candor was that there was an amended complaint and it dropped the federal claim, and then there was the question of whether there is discretion to remand versus just discretion to dismiss for lack of continuing jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: And do you have any way to rationalize St. Paul Mercury other than it's been codified now?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, I do think that I can rationalize St. Paul Mercury. As I was saying just a moment ago, I do think that the amount in controversy, even before Congress said in 1446 we have to look to the initial pleading, going back to cases like St. Paul Mercury, it is reasonable to read -- read the words \"amount in controversy\" to mean theoretically possible to be recovered. It doesn't matter what happens after you file your lawsuit. And so, if the plaintiff pleads in an initial complaint, consistent with Rule 11 or whatever the equivalent was in 1938, I'm above the jurisdictional amount in controversy, that's showing that it's theoretically possible to recover that amount in good faith, and that's good enough for the statutory jurisdictional requirement that Congress added onto Article III.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer of Defendant, in thinking about -- you know, the different boxes and some of the inconsistencies. One way I've been thinking about this is I think it's been true for a very long time, back to Strawbridge versus Curtiss and the complete diversity requirement, you know, talking about Mottley and the well-pleaded complaint rule, that the Court for a very long time exercised a pretty free hand in interpreting 13-1 and --1331 and 1332. That language is identical to Article III, but yet the Court interpreted it to mean something different. And I think that in the Gibbs regime pre -1367, the Court was exercising a pretty free hand in -- in articulating the contours of pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction before Congress controlled it. Can you think -- I mean, I think a lot of this case seems to kind of come down to is that just the way we've been treating jurisdictional statutes and do we keep it up with 1367, or in 1367 because, in Finley, the Court kind of said no, look, Congress, there need to be clear jurisdictional rules, expressly invited Congress to address it, which Congress did. Would you say, do you think it's fair to say, or can you think of a counter-example that in 1367, when it comes to supplemental jurisdiction, the Court has tightened its belt and isn't being as free-wheeling, or can you think of other examples where the Court, this Court, has done kind of what the court of appeals seemed to have continued to do in 1367, which is maybe make a little bit more jurisdictional policy than was set out in the text?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah, an important question, Judge. I think I would describe the history a little differently. I wouldn't describe it as free-wheeling. I would say it all points in one direction. The Court construed jurisdictional statutes more narrowly than Article III. So that's certainly true with Strawbridge versus Curtiss. We know that there's not a complete diversity requirement because of CAFA. It's the same thing with 1331. Justice Thomas noted this in Grable. From the very beginning of the Jurisdiction and Removal Act of 1875, this Court almost immediately construed the words \"arising under\" to be not coextensive with Article III.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "301", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-1127, Wisconsin Bell versus United States ex rel. Todd Heath.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc.\n\nThe FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent.\n\nAs a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box.\n\nThe program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act.\n\nThe consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims.\n\nFirst, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program.\n\nText, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting the public fisc at risk.\n\nThat never happened here.\n\nThe government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake.\n\nSecond, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent.\n\nBy design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here: grants of E-rate reimbursement requests.\n\nIn fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act.\n\nChoices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Ms. Ho, could you focus just briefly on the $100 million that the government says it contributes or provides? That -- much of that is collected under a debt collection provision that authorizes the government to collect its -- a debt owed to it. That seems somewhat at odds with your argument that it's not the government's money.\n\nHow could it be collected under that Act if it is not owed to the government? And if -- if it is owed to the government, then why isn't it the government's money after that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Justice Thomas, and let me answer both parts of your question.\n\nLet me begin by addressing the debt settlement and restitution.\n\nThose funds are no different than the E-rate contributions themselves.\n\nThey are owed to the Administrative Company.\n\nThe United States just collects and returns those funds to their private owner.\n\nA -- a -- a good analogy is like child support.\n\nLike a parent provides child support even when the United States withholds from the parent's income and sends to the other parent, the private telecom carriers provide E-rate funds even when the United States collects their delinquent debts, just like when a private litigant uses a sheriff to go after a property to pay judgment.\n\nNow let -- Justice Thomas, let me address directly your question about the Debt Collection Improvement Act.\n\nAnd those debts don't belong to the government, even under the Debt Collection Improvement Act, for three reasons.\n\nNumber one, that's a different statutory scheme with different language. That's the Blanca case from the Tenth Circuit that we cite in our brief.\n\nThe FCA limits a claim to money that the United States provides, and the Debt Collection Improvement Act defines \"claim\" more expansively without regard to its effect on the public fisc.\n\nAnd, number two, relatedly, the Debt Collection Improvement Act applies to funds that the United States is authorized by statute to collect for the benefit of any person.\n\nThat is Section 3701(b)(1)(D).\n\nSo money belongs to the person for whose benefit the government collects it.\n\nThe government just holds it in trust.\n\nAnd that's in our brief on page 32.\n\nAnd my friend, the Solicitor General, admits on page 17 of the Solicitor General's brief that they are obligated, the government is obligated, to transmit funds back to the Administrative Company.\n\nJudge: The -- the --\n\nJudge: Can I ask you a question -- oh.\n\nSorry.\n\nJudge: I was just -- the government, though, treats this, these funds, as appropriated funds, right? They -- they're -- as I understand it, they're called backdoor appropriations?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: You're correct, Mr. Chief Justice, that OMB and the President's budget have -- have labeled the E-rate funds as -- I think they're -- I think the -- the bureaucratic term is \"permanent indefinite appropriations,\" but even -- even OMB, in using that term, admitted that -- I think -- I think the language used was that the line between the private sector and government can be murky and that it was including those funds in the budget out of a desire to be -- to be comprehensive. So, ultimately, it is this Court's responsibility to interpret this statute and determine what the nature of the funds are.\n\nSo bookkeeping labels aren't dispositive of that question, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nJudge: But I guess I'm wondering why the government isn't collecting the money here for a public purpose for the funding of this program.\n\nYou suggest that the money belongs to the person for whom the government collects the funds, and I thought the funds were being collected to operate this government program.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, Justice Jackson, I take your question to be focused on, you know, isn't -- isn't money that the government collects -- which, of course, we know the government isn't actually collecting the money here.\n\nThe private carriers are paying their money --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nI was just responding --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- to another private person.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I was just -- I was just trying to understand your response to Justice Thomas, who said --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- we have a hundred million dollars that the government is collecting, admittedly, as a result of settlements and debt collection, in the context of this program, but, ultimately, the reason why the money is being collected is because the government has ordered telecom companies to fund this government program.\n\nSo the ultimate beneficiary, I would think, is the public, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So we know, Your Honor, from the text of the False Claims Act and its definition of \"claim\" that just having a government purpose isn't enough and that the -- the precise language -- and this is 3729(b)(2)(A).\n\nIt defines a claim, and it says, \"if the money or property is to be spent or used on the government's behalf or to advance a government program or interest,\" which is what you're asking me about, \"and if the United States provides or has provided any portion of the money or property.\" So it's not enough that --\n\nJudge: So I guess I don't understand your argument about \"provides.\" Can you help me?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

One, it only applies only to regulations, not statutes.\n\nSecondly, it applies only when the period of action is provided in the regulation.\n\nAnd we don't think that applies.

{"id": "659", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 23-1141, Smith & Wesson Brands versus Estados Unidos Mexicanos.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mexico asserts that American firearms companies are responsible for cartel violence ravaging Mexico.\n\nIts theory is that federally licensed manufacturers sell firearms to licensed distributors, who sell to licensed retailers, a small percentage of whom sell to straw purchasers, some of whom transfer to smugglers, who then smuggle them into Mexico, hand them over to cartels, who in turn use them to commit murder and mayhem, all of which requires the government of Mexico to spend money.\n\nNeedless to say, no case in American history supports that theory, and it's squarely foreclosed by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n\nAs to proximate cause, this Court has repeatedly said there must be a direct relationship between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury.\n\nBut no such relationship exists if plaintiff's injury is caused by multiple intervening independent crimes committed by foreign criminals on foreign soil to inflict harm on a foreign sovereign.\n\nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico doesn't identify a specific crime, criminal, or criminal enterprise that defendants supposedly helped.\n\nInstead, it asserts that defendants are liable for every illegal sale by every retailer in America because they know that a small percentage of firearms are sold illegally and don't do more to stop it.\n\nAgain, no case in history supports that theory.\n\nIndeed, if Mexico is right, then every law enforcement organization in America has missed the largest criminal conspiracy in history operating right under their nose, and Budweiser is liable for every accident caused by underage drinkers since it knows that teenagers will buy beer, drive drunk, and crash.\n\nThe First Circuit gravely erred in embracing that implausible theory and should be reversed.\n\nJudge: Mr. Francisco, as to the predicate exception, which federal or state law is your -- is Petitioner reputed to have violated?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So my understanding, Your Honor, is that they're invoking the federal aiding-and-abetting statute to argue that we have aided and abetted the federal statutes that govern the sale of firearms, and they're alleging that retailers have knowingly sold firearms to straw purchasers and that we aided and abetted that knowing sale.\n\nThat actually raises a very important question about their allegation of knowing.\n\nI don't think it's relevant because I'm willing to even assume a certain level of knowledge.\n\nI don't think it matters.\n\nBut their theory of knowledge is that we actually know that retailers are selling illegally.\n\nI'd actually urge you to look at that 2010 Washington Post article that they incorporate into their complaint.\n\nThat article talks about a particular retailer called Lone Wolf.\n\nIn 2010, it was the number one seller of firearms that were found in Mexican crime gun scenes.\n\nAnd, in that article, you actually have a quote from ATF that says that ATF has no -- has no basis to believe that Lone Wolf is doing anything illegal or wrong.\n\nWell, if the government doesn't know, how are we supposed to know? It reflects this convoluted theory that -- that simply because the gun is found in Mexico, can be traced back to a retailer, that means the retailer necessarily sold it illegally and that we know that the retailer sold it illegally.\n\nJudge: Would this be a different case if there was a specific federal or state statute that was alleged -- that you were known to have violated?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, it would be a different case.\n\nI would want to know more because I still think that, depending on what they alleged, I would have very strong arguments on proximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability, but it would certainly be a different case.\n\nJudge: Well, the -- the -- the reason I ask is because the exception is for knowingly violating a state or federal statute, and it would seem helpful in determining aiding and abetting and then eventually proximate cause if that comes up if you knew which statute we were dealing with.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So the complaint is a little bit vague on this.\n\nTo the extent I understand it, they're looking at federal statutes that restrict the knowing sale of firearms to people who aren't authorized to purchase them, and then they're invoking the criminal federal aiding-and-abetting statute to claim that we're then liable for those illegal sales.\n\nI'm willing to assume for the sake of argument that that's valid because I don't think they come anywhere close to establishing aiding-and-abetting liability, and even if they did, I don't think they come anywhere close to establishing proximate cause.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, counsel, but exactly what role -- I had difficulty telling from your brief -- does foreseeability play in your proximate cause analysis?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, as -- as this Court has made clear in a number of cases, it's not that foreseeability is irrelevant.\n\nIt's that foreseeability alone is not the standard. So it's necessary but not sufficient.\n\nIn addition, there has to be a direct relationship between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury.\n\nAnd, Your Honor, I think that the plurality opinion you authored in the Hemi Group is directly on point.\n\nThat is where a case -- a case where the plurality held that the City of New York couldn't sue a cigarette retailer for not filing the tax reports in order for the city to recover its lost tax revenue because in between the city's injury of lost tax revenue and the retailer's failure to file the reports stood the citizens of New York who illegally failed to pay their taxes, and that broke the chain.\n\nThis is a much easier case.\n\nHere, we don't have just one intervening independent crime.\n\nWe have a multitude of intervening independent crimes.\n\nSo, even if they could establish aiding-and-abetting liability -- and I don't think they come even close under Twitter -- they couldn't establish proximate cause, which is the other requirement here.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "385", "dialogue": "Judge: Yeah, I have a question about the phrase in (c)(1), the specific intent. Do you agree it's specific intent with the intent to impair the object's integrity?

Like, do you think that that intent requirement carries over to (c)(2)?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The corruptly intent requirement?\n\nJudge: Not—not corruptly. The \"with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in a proceeding\"?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, we do, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So it carries over. How—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And we'd say that's the object of—of—of the overarching mens rea.\n\nJudge: But how can that be? I mean, it seems like that, you know, (c)(2) would read awfully oddly then. It would be \"otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any proceeding with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding\"? That would be your position of how it would read?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that's right. I mean, it's—it's awkward. I mean, there's no doubt that it's an awkward statute, but, if you—if you do the operation that I talked about earlier, which is we're just going to use \"otherwise\" to replace the verbs and the nouns in (c)(1), then—then the statute makes perfect sense.\n\nWith respect to intent, I mean, I think Your Honor makes an excellent point, which is that this intent is a specific form of intent. The \"corruptly,\" which has been construed to be the mens rea up there, is not different than—at least on this reading, is not—is not—or on the accepted reading by the D.C. Circuit right now is not different than—than some form of specific intent.\n\nJudge: So \"corruptly\" is redundant?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It seems like it's getting to be, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's true. And our submission is that \"corruptly\" should mean something different. So should \"proceeding.\" That's how you marry 1512 with 1519.\n\nJudge: Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: So I'm just still wondering if your theory about this provision might be too narrow in a sense because you've got evidence going and spoliation in a sense. What I—what I'm trying to work out in my mind is whether you would still have a decent argument if this 1512 language is read to prohibit the corrupt tampering with things that are used to conduct an official proceeding with the intent of undermining the integrity of the thing or access to the thing and thereby obstructing the proceeding.\n\nIt's not just evidence. It's a proceeding. (c)(1) is an example of, you know, the corrupt tampering with certain things. And (c)(2) broadens it out a bit. It's not just documents and records. What do you think about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that's—that's a correct reading, Your Honor. I mean, we—as—as—as 1512(f) demonstrates, it doesn't—you know, 1512(f) we would submit actually supports our position because it says the evidence need not be admissible or free of a privilege claim.\n\nNow what would that mean about what the statute is addressing if it's not evidence? But (c)(2) has been applied, and—and occasionally (c)(1) has been applied.\n\nJudge: In a non-evidentiary way?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, to—to—to things that could become evidence, to the efforts to shape someone's grand jury testimony.\n\nJudge: All right. Let me—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —to answers to interrogatories.\n\nJudge: —let me ask you about the question that the other judge asked before. You know, you—you suggested that it has to be to the document, but—in other words, the—the—the activity has to be actually to the document, but I don't know why that's the case under (c)(2).\n\nAnother judge says, well, one of the commonalities between (c)(1) and (c)(2) could be the impairment of the object's integrity or availability. The previous judge posits a scenario in which you have someone who is impairing the availability by doing something to prevent the object from getting to the proceeding. Why wouldn't that count under (c)(2)?\n\nSo this is—this is, you know, preventing Congress from counting the electoral votes, for example. Let's say it's being done. The previous judge says it's in an envelope going to the vice president's desk and someone does something to impair or prevent that from happening. Why isn't that what (c)(2) could cover?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, first, it's not affecting the integrity of the document, Your Honor, or—or the—or—\n\nJudge: Availability is also in the statute.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Availability it says too, but, as I mentioned earlier, simply delaying the arrival of evidence at the courthouse—\n\nJudge: No, not delay. Let's say the person steals the envelope and takes it away.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Then it gets harder, I agree. If they steal the envelope, they take it away, they rip it up, all of those things, which is certainly not what happened here, and it's not in the indictment—the—the ballots or the—the vote count is not even in the indictment.\n\nJudge: Well, we—we wouldn't have to decide that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: We could send it back if we clarified that that is what the statute means.

I think—\n\nJudge: And they've admitted that they're an outlier. What do we do about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I guess a couple of points. First, I think it is true that the four states that I think were on the other side of this, whether judges or juries had to make these recidivism findings, they were an—they were an outlier as to the default common law rule in this context. I concede that the majority of states had a default common law rule that these recidivism findings or these recidivism facts had to be in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. I think—so I think South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Kansas, they were outliers with respect to that tradition. But what I don't think they were—\n\nJudge: But some of them weren't even members of the original states that formed the compact that led to the Sixth Amendment.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's true, Your Honor, but I think the—and as to your second point, the later cases, Alabama, Kansas, they—although they come later, they recognize that there had been a settled tradition in those states. And I think Plaintiff and the government have shown nothing to contradict that. So I think that is a fair assumption. And I do think that—so the fact that there is this different common law tradition in the majority of states, it doesn't—I don't think that's enough to establish that this was a fundamental principle that was incorporated into the Constitution, because we have these states within that majority, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, these are significant states, that were a part of the initial compact and that allowed legislatures to deviate from the common law rule. And then when those supplemental information statutes were challenged in court on constitutional grounds, courts rejected those challenges all the way through to this Court's decision in 1910 endorsing the Massachusetts Ross decision from 1824. So I think there's just a uniform string of precedents saying this majority common law rule that recidivism has to be in the indictment and proved to a jury, it's something the legislature can alter.\n\nJudge: Can I ask you about bifurcation? Do you think bifurcation is completely in the discretion of the trial judge?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I think it's in the discretion of the trial judge—\n\nJudge: If you lose here and—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right. I think, in the federal system, it is—under Rule 14, I think it's subject to the discretion of the trial judge, subject to abuse of discretion review.\n\nJudge: Would there be any constitutional overlay on that? In other words, it was impermissible to deny bifurcation under these circumstances?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so. I think the Court has refused to require bifurcation as a constitutional matter, and I don't think the Court should do so in this case. And I also don't think the Court should sort of place a thumb on the scale even if the Court sides with Plaintiff and the government here to say that bifurcation should ordinarily be required in these cases because I do think there is something to the idea that the government really does have, I think, a right to present to a single jury all of its evidence on all of the elements of the crime. And if you rule for Plaintiff and the government here, I think what you are saying is that this occasions fact is sort of an element of the crime. And then on bifurcation—I think bifurcation, the other problem which I mentioned earlier is that states have varying procedures on bifurcation, and so some of them make it discretionary, and I think—so it's going to have—it's hard to say exactly how this is going to play out in the states.\n\nJudge: That's true with respect to Old Chief too?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct. I think Old Chief—I think Old Chief doesn't really solve the prejudice problem because, as you see from the Harrell case we cite, that case involved an Old Chief stipulation, so bifurcation was denied. The defendant was then forced to stipulate or he chose to stipulate, I guess, under Old Chief. And that stipulation has to be read to the jury, and that jury has to be told this is a three-time convicted felon. That's a big difference from being told this is, you know, a one-time convicted felon.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

They did not want the kind of thing that Judge Friendly was describing -- I think my friend is right about this -- where you had what was called fraud by hindsight, where, you know, a stock goes down, the day later, you know, plaintiffs' lawyers who are not representing institutional investors file a lawsuit without any investigation. Those kinds of cases where, you know, they're looking for a theory of fraud without any information, those kinds of things are what the PSLRA was intended to root out and appropriately so because Congress did strike a balance.\r\n\r\nCongress recognized that there is a value to having private securities litigation as a supplement to public enforcement to ensure that our capital markets are the best in the world, that they are efficient, that they are honest, that people can rely on our stock markets.\r\n\r\nJudge Kavanaugh: If Judge Sanchez's opinion had been the majority opinion, would you have sought cert?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I probably would have been very upset, but I probably would have counseled my clients that this is a fact-bound disagreement --\r\n\r\nJudge Kavanaugh: Really? (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- about settled standards.\r\n\r\nJudge Kavanaugh: I wouldn't bind yourself like that, but anyway, thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge Roberts: Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge Roberts: Ms. Sinzdak.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To resolve this case, the Court does not need to create any new one-size-fits-all rules. Instead, it can simply reiterate a few basic principles that flow from the plain text of the PSLRA, and the good news is I think we're all agreed on those basic legal principles. So, first, as to scienter, the PSLRA requires a plaintiff to plead enough particularized facts to create a strong inference of scienter. Particularity means detail.\r\n\r\nBut the particularity requirement doesn't say anything about what kind of details the plaintiff has to plead.\r\n\r\nSo long as she pleads enough details to make the inference of scienter at least as likely as any competing innocent inference, then she has cleared the PSLRA's bar.\r\n\r\nAnd we think that happened here. Second, as to expert reports, the PSLRA does not mention them at all.\r\n\r\nSo they're neither disfavored, nor are they preferred.\r\n\r\nIt's just that the same basic standards apply.\r\n\r\nSo, if a plaintiff is relying on facts drawn from an expert report, they have to be pleaded with particularity.\r\n\r\nAnd if the plaintiff is relying on a belief, it's making information and belief pleading, then it needs to plead the particularized facts supporting that -- that opinion, that belief. Again, we think that's the standard the Ninth Circuit applied here, and so all the Court needs to do is reiterate these principles and affirm.

{"id": "29", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, that— that— if that's how Employees is read, then that is inconsistent, I would argue, with what the Court has said since, which is that Congress can state its intent in any way it wants.\nAnd if you simply foreclose use of statutory definitions in— in— in Congress's ability to state— state its intent, I think—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's a thin line, but the line has been between in the cause of action provision itself is the explicit reference and in a separate definitional provision, as in— as in Employees and mentioned in Union Gas as well, that's different.\nNow that's a thin line. I might not have come up with that if I were starting from scratch, but—\n\nJudge: But is it— is it really a line at all? I mean, what if— what if we have the definition provision in— the definition provision next to the cause of action provision?\nI mean, here, it's in a, fine. But you can imagine a world in which they write 1681n and 1 is the provision that says any person willfully, et cetera, and 2 is \"person\" means, and they list out the statute, list out the entities.\nI mean, I— I think it's— it's so fine a line that it probably is nonexistent from— from the standpoint of really understanding what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I do think it's a fairly arbitrary line if you hold onto it, if you can say— you try to refashion Employees into the modern era and say this is the line we're going to draw in terms of telling Congress how it needs to write a statute, do not put your—your— identify your— the government's— any governments in the statutory definition, put it in the cause of action, then that's— that's— that's one thing.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's a— But—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: — it's a good point. It's exactly the Brennan dissent, but I said that before, but, yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But the— I mean, once again, I would point out that none of the courts of appeals that have addressed this issue read Employees that way. They—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, two of—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Two of them don't even—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: — two of the—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: — cite— cite it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, they don't cite it. And in at least one, D.C., it wasn't even raised. I'm not sure what happened there.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It— it was raised in the oral argument in D.C.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, but not in the briefs. It wasn't raised.\nRight. That's right. That's the only court that it wasn't in the briefs.\n\nJudge: Now us setting forth a statement like that, you need to do this, would be contrary to our— all the jurisprudence in which we say you don't need magic words, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think so. I mean, the way I see it is that the Court is reluctant to tell Congress how to craft legislative language because that is inherently tied to policymaking, which is inherently an Article I type of function.\nAnd so even though the Court, you know, will interpret the words Congress does use, it— it's not going to tell Congress, for example, if you list out sovereigns in a definition, you better include Indian tribes or else we're going to assume you don't mean it.\nIt's going to— what— what's— what the Court's going to do, as it did in Lac du Flambeau, is to say we're going to take the words Congress has given us and we're going to interpret it. If it's ambiguous, the government gets the benefit of the doubt. If it's not ambiguous, we're going to give the text its plain meaning.\nAnd— and this text is not ambiguous.\n\nJudge: Do— do you— do you take any stock on the amendment history? I mean, you know, I— I appreciate the plain meaning, we just look at the statute and see what it says, and maybe, in that world, it is parallel to Employees.\nBut Employees seemed to put some stock in the amendment history as it analyzed what was going on, saying that it— it was surprised that Congress had not amended the cause of action.\nAnd, here, we have an amendment history that shows that Congress was amending the cause of action. And so, if our ultimate question is how do we— how and whether we should be implying some kind of intention on Congress's part to extend the cause of action to government, is the amendment history relevant at all?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think it definitely is relevant that Congress amended the cause— cause of action. Even if you take Employees at face value, that should be sufficient. I think the other things that go along with that are the fact that Congress amended the cause of action at the same time it imposed substantive duties on governments.\nAnd I think the other thing to keep in mind is that governments are not strangers to the FCRA. Congress accommodates the government's interests throughout the statute, creating exemptions for them, for example, in the national security area, exemptions in terms of the adverse action response requirements that apply to persons, the government in the— in the— in the context of national security, Congress has created an exemption for them.\nAnd then I would indicate again in— in other— other statutes in the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Congress knew how— it showed it knows how to create exemptions for the government. TILA, the— the Truth in Lending Act, extends liability to all creditors. Congress said we don't want— even though the government is a creditor as defined in that statute, we don't want liability to be imposed, so we're going to create a carve-out for that for the government.\nIn the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Congress enacted that without any exceptions for the government two years later in 1976, and— and that was an act two years— one year after Employees.\nIn 1976, they said we don't want punitive damages to be imposed on the government, so it carved out a—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\nJustice Thomas?\nJustice Alito?\n\nJudge: Just assume for the sake of argument that \"person\" in q does not include the government. Could you just give me your best answer to the argument that n and o should be treated the same way?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: N and o deal with civil liability, which deals with the substantive provisions of the statute, all of which use \"person\" consistently to include the government. It's a different context entirely.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: Do you think q doesn't deal with the government because the government can't be jailed, or do you think it doesn't include the government for what other reason?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We would— if that— if the case were before me, I would say it includes the government because Congress did not create an exemption like it did in the Truth in Lending Act for governmental criminal liability.\n\nJudge: Correct. And there's all sorts of statutes that I mentioned earlier, the Clean Water Act being the primary one, where the government is included in the criminal provision, and it speaks about jailing and imprisonment.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And we just don't imply— we just don't apply the jailing part because you can't jail a corporate entity, correct, or a—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It would be the same analysis for corporate entities and the government.\n\nJudge: So there's— it's not that you're reading \"person\" differently in q. You're just saying that some remedies can't be applied?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think— I think that's right. There are a number of ways to deal with q.

{"id": "473", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I just ask you—because I'm trying to follow. So you've said many times that the money is going out, but I guess I'm trying to figure out whether the proceeds of the life insurance are really going out when they're being used to redeem the shares.\n\nJudge: So what is the effect on the value of the remaining shares once the redemption occurs?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the remaining shares effectively have a larger share of ownership in the company.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In other words—\n\nJudge: Their value increases. Is that where the four times that another judge was talking about— is that where that comes from?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that's correct. And this is the contrast, I think, with a voluntary redemption because in the context of a voluntary redemption, rather than these life insurance proceeds, something else has to go out of the company and you are getting the shares back into the company.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the reason why that is different is that here you are extinguishing an existing liability. That is what makes this different—\n\nJudge: But you're treating this—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —is that you have a liability on the books.\n\nJudge: You're treating this redemption obligation like any other redemption obligation.\n\nJudge: And it's really not like any other redemption obligation because this obligation is benefiting the equity interests that we're trying to value.\n\nJudge: And so it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense in that context to say that the redemption obligation simultaneously serves to reduce the value of that interest.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that that's a fair factual statement, but let me explain to you why that should make no difference.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In our view, the redemption obligation is like any other debt from the perspective of the hypothetical buyer.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I recognize that this is the artificiality of the case, but I think it's an artificiality of the case that is inherent in the way that the regulations work, and I think it's a problem that the government has to come to terms with as well.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Our view is that, from the perspective of a hypothetical third party, the fact that this redemption obligation runs to somebody else is of no moment.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The hypothetical buyer here is not in the same position as the deceased shareholder. It's a hypothetical buyer.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And so that is why we think that when you're applying a regulation that requires you to take into account all relevant facts, you've got to look at the economic reality from the position of the company.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And, again, the best way I think to understand that is to think about whether or not the government's fair market valuation would be one that the parties would use.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We know that our fair market valuation, in fact, pretty closely tracks the price that was agreed.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: $5.3 million would have destroyed the company if the company had spent that amount of money to redeem the shares because, again, the life insurance proceeds would not have covered that amount.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I think that illustrates why the government's position cannot be correct.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Can I just ask one more question? Assume that the company doesn't take out life insurance to fund the redemption. The agreement just says the company promises to redeem the shares at fair market value upon the shareholder's death.\n\nJudge: What, if anything, about your treatment of the redemption obligation changes in that circumstance?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the analysis is somewhat different, Judge. And I think that that is similar to the two-sisters hypothetical that the government uses in its brief.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And that is for the simple reason—and we've kind of been talking to some extent about this—that in that hypothetical, the obligation to redeem shares actually has a depressive effect on the company's future earning capacity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Why? Precisely because the company has to use other assets and typically operating assets in order to fund the redemption obligation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And in that circumstance, there could well be a depressive effect on the valuation, and that depressive effect could, in fact, be substantial.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: One reason why this circumstance is different is precisely because where you have an offsetting life insurance policy and redemption obligation, it actually makes sense to think about valuation in terms of the net worth of the company.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think once you start to get away from that, the valuation of the company is affected by its remaining operating assets, how the business is going to do on a going-forward basis.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But here, precisely because there's no effect on the remainder of the company, it makes sense to engage in the valuation by multiplying the percentage of shares by the net worth.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Counsel, please proceed.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: May it please the Court: The estate's evaluation of the deceased shareholder's shares contradicts basic math and valuation principles.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: According to the estate, before we can value the deceased shareholder's shares in the company, we must first subtract the price that the company paid for those shares.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: In other words, the estate's theory is that before you can value something, you must first subtract the price paid for the very thing you are trying to value.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That makes no sense.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Using the item you're trying to value as a line item in its own valuation will never give you the correct answer, and it doesn't give the estate the right answer here either.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The estate's contrary view rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a redemption obligation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: A redemption obligation is not a corporate debt that reduces the corporation's net worth or the value of the shares to be redeemed.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: A debt owed to creditors reduces corporate and shareholder value.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: A redemption obligation divides the corporate pie among existing shareholders without changing the value of their interests.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And here the corporate pie was worth 6.86 million, not 3.86 million.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And that's true even if you look only at the estate's own numbers.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The estate walked away from the redemption with approximately $3 million in cash, but Petitioner also admits that another shareholder walked away from the redemption with $3.86 million in value.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And the estate doesn't dispute the basic valuation principle that the interest of each equity shareholder added together has to equal the company's total value.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That defeats their position because that means that the company's total net worth before the division was 6.86 million.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The value of the two equities added back together, and that means the estate's valuation of the deceased shareholder's 77 percent stake at $3 million came nowhere close to fair market value.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: I think what Petitioner is arguing is that, yes, we took the insurance policy, received 3.5 million, paid out 3, and received the shares, so it's a wash.\n\nJudge: The 3 million, up to 3 million, it's a wash.\n\nJudge: So what do you do with that argument?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "528", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has recognized that cases like these, where state defendants disclaim the use of race in line drawing and argue that any racial disparities are simply the result of a correlation between race and political affiliation, present special challenges for trial courts and require an especially sensitive inquiry. As part of that inquiry, plaintiffs bear the burden to disentangle race and politics and show that race drove the map-makers' decisions about where to place a significant number of voters. The district court found that plaintiffs had done that here. But this Court has also been clear that on appeal, this Court's job is more straightforward. Racial predominance is a factual finding subject to clear error review even when there's a politics defense. The Court has also repeatedly rejected attempts to impose unjustified evidentiary hurdles as a matter of law on redistricting plaintiffs. Defendants' arguments for reversal in this case contradict those settled principles. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: If we find no intent to discriminate or to -- that there was vote -- on the vote dilution claim, that's what I'm more interested in, you seem to want us to send it back on that. But, if you find -- we find no intent, should we, or should we just simply resolve it here?\n\nPlaintiff: So our position on the second claim is that if this Court were not to affirm on the first racial gerrymandering claim -- and not find racial predominance there, that this Court should remand on the second claim because we believe the district court used the wrong legal standards to evaluate that claim.\n\nJudge: And what should that standard be?\n\nPlaintiff: So, first, we -- the district court simply sort of took the findings it had made on racial predominance and the Shaw standard and carried them over, but the intent standard is different for an intentional vote dilution claim. It's the Arlington Heights inquiry that this Court --\n\nJudge: And that is -- it's the -- again, the vote dilution claim. It seems as though those were collapsed into one another, the redistricting and the vote dilution, and dealt with on the same standard. So I'm wondering, if the standard is intent with respect to the dilution claim, if you don't see that intent here, why should we remand it?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I don't think the court -- the district court made the findings under the correct intent standard for you to evaluate that. I mean, as I mentioned, the district court just asked about racial predominance, but they are different intent inquiries. For intentional vote dilution, you're asking about a specific intent to dilute the voting strength of the minority population, not just whether race predominated in the line-drawing decisions.\n\nJudge: And you're saying we couldn't determine that on the record that's here?\n\nPlaintiff: I think this Court should follow its usual practice and instruct the lower court about the correct legal standards and then send it back for that decision, determination to be made in the first instance by the court looking at the full record if the Court were to have occasion to reach that second claim.\n\nJudge: Ms. Flynn, your office reviews a lot of these voting cases, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, our enforcement work is typically in vote dilution, not in racial gerrymandering per se, but, yes, of course, we've been involved in these cases before the Court.\n\nJudge: Putting that aside, have you ever supported the plaintiffs in a case in which there was no evidence of any direct discrimination, no alternative map, no oddly shaped districts, and a volume and volume of political data? Can you think of one where your office has done that before?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I -- you know, this might be the first case where there hasn't been sort of direct evidence of an attempt at VRA compliance or the like, but I do think that -- when you brought up the alternative map, I do think that the -- the plaintiffs offered expert evidence to answer that same question about was it race or was it politics that were driving the line-drawing decisions.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that's one of the things I brought up. I also brought up the absence of direct discrimination, the absence of oddly shaped districts, the lack of -- I mean the great volume of political evidence, and throw in another one, anything that all of that has been done, it is alleged on racial basis, to change the population in the district of the desired voters by 1.3 percent? I mean -- I mean, my point is -- is a clear one. Have you ever seen anything like this?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, this Court has affirmed, I believe, on a circumstantial record I think in North Carolina versus Covington. The Court said that there, the state was completely denying using race. The legislature told its map-maker not to look at race. And this Court still said it was permissible for the district court to find based on demographic information and information about the shape of the district that race was, in fact, relied upon. I'd also say that here, the district court did look at traditional redistricting principles and find that they were subordinated in this instance. For instance, this new district is not contiguous when the previous district was. Of course, there was previously a Charleston County divide, but this is I don't think the case that the traditional districting principles wholly supported the state's story here. And I will sort of go back to the expert evidence in this case. In our view, we think the Ragusa expert and Liu were the most probative on the question we've been talking about today, which is was it race or was it politics that were driving the district lines.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I want to just explore the alternative map non-requirement requirement thing for a minute.\n\nPlaintiff: Sure.\n\nJudge: Everybody seems to take as given that the legislature here did seek to pursue a partisan gerrymander, if you will, or a partisan tilt, I think, is their preferred term, and that that's permissible under this Court's precedents. We start with that as a given.\n\nPlaintiff: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: Right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And that the plaintiff bears the burden of overcoming a good-faith presumption that the legislature is doing just what it says, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: How do you prove that they are acting in bad faith without showing that they could achieve their objective some different way?\n\nPlaintiff: I agree that that could be a probative piece of evidence in some cases, and I think that's what the Court said in Cooper. What we're pushing back on is the idea that you need to have, as a matter of law, for the plaintiffs' case to even get off the ground, an alternative map that checks all the boxes.\n\nJudge: I get that, and I'm wondering why. I mean, normally, if a plaintiff bears a burden of proof, you have to show that it would have happened but for, you know, this change in the world. And I think the -- here, the analogy would be -- and I'm just exploring this. I don't know. All right? I could be wrong. Probably am. But, in a but-for world, the legislature could have achieved its partisan purposes, nefarious, happy, whatever you think they are, in some other way without -- without doing what it did that you're objecting to. And, here, there's no -- no evidence that the legislature could have achieved its partisan tilt, which everyone says is permissible, in any other way.\n\nPlaintiff: So I --\n\nJudge: What do we do with that when -- when -- with the presumption of good faith?\n\nPlaintiff: So I have a couple responses to that. First, I do think the expert evidence answers the same question. An alternative map says, if you were really relying on the thing you said you were relying, wouldn't you have done -- maybe you would have done this other thing instead.\n\nJudge: I could have achieved the same partisan objective 15 different ways, and with map-drawing technology and computers, you know, they spit out maps by the thousands these days. I would have thought that would have been a relatively modest burden.\n\nPlaintiff: But it's still --\n\nJudge: What am I missing?\n\nPlaintiff: -- it's still just a way to answer the question what better explains how lines were drawn. And we think the expert evidence does that. The other thing I would say about creating this kind of requirement as a legal rule, rather than something that can be a piece of evidence that both sides can make arguments about, is that I think it's going to add even more complication to these even very, very complicated cases. So my understanding is that defendants want their alternative map requirement to be limited to circumstances where there is no or meager direct evidence. So I think, first, you're going to have a mini-trial on is this a case where there's sufficient direct evidence or not to bring this rule into play. And then I think you're going to have to have litigation and probably appeals on what the alternative map has to do.\n\nJudge: No, I'm not even asking about -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm really not interested in whether it's a requirement or not. I'm just -- just as a factual matter, wouldn't it have been the simplest thing to do? If I'm plaintiff and I want to show the defendant can achieve its permissible ends in some other way, I think, in most other scenarios, in a tort case or an antitrust case, is what I'm thinking about, I would show that there were 15 other ways to achieve that which you said you wanted to achieve.

{"id": "886", "dialogue": "Judge: Is it not true that he has a long record working for the legislature and he's drawn maps for both Republicans and Democrats?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, the panel acknowledged he has two decades of experience in which he used race every time he was drawing maps in the past but denied doing so in this case.\n\nJudge: At trial, Judge Gergel -- is that the correct pronunciation of his name, Gergel?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, it is Judge Gergel.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Judge Gergel had complimentary things to say about him. He said, I know Mr. Roberts. He's a very precise guy. What I want is if that report -- he's talking about a particular report -- isn't accurate, and I'm persuaded, if he tells me it's not, that's good enough for me.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, and also his honesty in Footnote 9, where he recognized that a year after trial, Mr. Roberts was able to cite with specificity the racial makeup of VTDs, which was completely inconsistent with his non-credible denials that he did not look at race.\n\nJudge: So, the district court turns around in its opinion and says that his testimony rings hollow. So that's a nice way of saying that he lied, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. And that's what this Court acknowledged was the case in Cooper with the three reasons for it, including his in-depth knowledge of the racial demographics of South Carolina.\n\nJudge: Is that damning?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, not in and of itself, because race consciousness is not the problem. It's the incredible denial, despite all of the evidence, including his testimony, experts' demonstrations, and the movement of so many people, and the coincidence that they land on the exact same patterns.\n\nJudge: So they say he gave no plausible explanation for that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct. In fact, Mr. Roberts admitted he abandoned the core priority of least change in CD1.\n\nJudge: Didn't he say that his aim was to produce a Republican district?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, the Court accepted that legitimate goal, but the Court recognized in Cooper that using race as a means to get there is constitutionally suspect.\n\nJudge: Isn't that a plausible explanation for all of those things?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Court found that the testimony was not as persuasive as the racial movements, and the expert testimony demonstrated otherwise.\n\nJudge: No, but the question is, is it a plausible reason?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, it is plausible, but the Court is not asked to relitigate the validity of expert testimony that it accepted.\n\nJudge: And the last one is he admitted that his movement of nearly 17,000 African Americans was inconsistent with the Clyburn staff plan for Charleston County that he claimed to be faithfully following, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, the state makes a big defense that their map is consistent with what Representative Clyburn was seeking. However, the record does not reflect that. More importantly, Representative Clyburn’s partial map did not harm West Ashley in the same way.\n\nJudge: Let me come back to the question I asked about why your experts did not produce an alternative map. Dr. Imai produced 10,000 maps, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct, for one simulation.\n\nJudge: He never considered politics?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: As Dr. Imai's testimony reflects, he tested for the criteria that the state was saying they were using, including the objective criteria. Dr. Imai and Dr. Duchin's methods were useful in supporting the conclusion that race was a significant factor.\n\nJudge: Well, in a case that's all about disentangling race and politics, how can we possibly give any weight to an expert report that did not take politics into account?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The district court was confronted with that question and relied upon Dr. Imai's testimony for the findings that it thought were probative. Dr. Ragusa and Dr. Liu provided unrebutted testimony that helped disentangle race.\n\nJudge: Did Dr. Imai run a simulation using political data as well but then decide to shelve it when the results were not favorable?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That is not what the record reflects.\n\nJudge: It never occurred to him that politics might have something to do with this?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Each expert is tasked with answering specific questions. Not every expert looks at every factor, but Dr. Ragusa and Dr. Liu focused on disentangling race and showed that race was more predictive than party affiliation.\n\nJudge: Did Dr. Duchin control for politics?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: She did in some of her analyses. She looked at how the maps performed with Black candidates and found that they performed worse in the enacted map compared to generic partisan races.\n\nJudge: Did Dr. Liu and Dr. Ragusa use the county envelope method?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, both did.\n\nJudge: Is that a sound method?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, it's a method used in past cases like Cooper and Bethune-Hill.\n\nJudge: Under that method, if two people live in the same apartment building, could one be moved and the other not?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The county envelope method works at the precinct level, not at the apartment level. It relies on moving entire precincts.\n\nJudge: Does it assume that all precincts could be moved, regardless of their location?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Only those within the county envelope, which reflects the fact that counties like Berkeley or Beaufort were wholly moved into CD1. It was fair to assume that any VTD in those counties could have been moved into CD1, and where they were not moved in, it involved Black voters.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

If you make the hoops so difficult to go through, then they have no remedy.\n\nHere, Mr. Williams was thrown out of -- out of the state process because he didn't receive notice because he was unconscious because of COVID, and he's had no remedy in their state court.\n\nSo, basically, what you're really saying is no, we're not hostile to a federal right because we know we're going to win no matter what we do.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, I think --\n\nJudge: And -- and one last question.\n\nTell me where in your regulations there is a process set out that -- that claimants can go through to speed up the process.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, Your Honor --\n\nJudge: All of them have told me that they've appealed on time, they've called a -- not all of them, but we have 21 plaintiffs here.\n\nMany of them filed their appeal notices, letter after letter, phone call after phone call, years and years that passed before they received anything or, when they received something, with no explanation.\n\nSo tell me where in your regulations you tell claimants what they can do before the agency if there's a due process violation.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, I don't have chapter and verse for you because, again, this was not raised --\n\nJudge: You can provide a letter.\n\nI don't want to hear about mandamus or -- I want to hear where in the regulations these people didn't do what the regulations said they could have done.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, mandamus is not something they're required to do, but it is something that is available --\n\nJudge: And it's --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- to them.\n\nJudge: -- discretionary, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Counsel, can --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Your Honor, but it is one way to avoid due process problems.\n\nPlaintiff: In the --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Counsel, can I just -- oh, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: No, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Can I just get you to focus in quickly on Felder, and you -- you've said many times that you see that case as the problem being about minimizing liability.\n\nBut I'm quoting from the case when it says that this is \"essentially\" -- \"the question is essentially one of preemption.\n\nIs the application of the state's law to Section 1983 actions brought in state courts consistent with the goals of the federal civil rights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement instead stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes of the objectives of Congress?\" I thought we were thinking about is it an obstacle, is it consistent? And what I'm worried about is that if we start moving away from that conception of what it means to be preempted, that same kind of thought process and doctrine is used in other laws, not just 1983.\n\nFor example, we have the Federal Arbitration Act, which has a preemption standard that is almost identical to what Felder just said about whether or not it's consistent.\n\nAnd we've repeatedly said that state laws that do things like -- you know, related to contracts, et cetera, et cetera, are preempted by the FAA for the very same reasons.\n\nSo can you help us not to be concerned about shifting the standard of what it means to preempt and the way in which that might actually implicate other preemption doctrines and other laws?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, Your Honor, I think -- I think the real concern would be adopting the view of preemption from my friend, which doesn't really seem to line up with the more disciplined and text-based approach that this Court traditionally --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, I -- we can --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- takes in the preemption context.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Let's say we reject saying there's something about Felder that is focused on exhaustion.\n\nI'm looking at Felder as a preemption case that has a standard that talks about the inconsistency with the purposes of the federal statute --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mm-hmm.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- is it an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution? And I got to tell you, in the Concepcion case in AT&T versus Mobility, that exact same concept is governing what the Court is doing with respect to preemption.\n\nSo, if we move from that, if we're focused more on minimizing liability or whatever else you say you think Felder means, I'm worried that that's going to bleed over into these other kinds of preemption areas.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, what I'd say to that is, why was the law an obstacle? And the text answers that question.\n\nState officials shall be liable.\n\nWhat's the state law do? Minimizes liability.\n\nSo there is your text-based preemption problem right there on the face of the statute.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It's not in the text of the statute.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Shall be liable --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Minimizing liability is not in --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\n\nBut the -- the law at issue there was part of a broader liability scheme -- the Felder Court recognized this -- that was enacted after Wisconsin had done away with judicial immunity.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court had done away with judicial immunity.\n\nAnd so this new immunity statute was enacted that had damages caps and also had this notice of claims requirement.\n\nWisconsin extolled this as a way to minimize liability.\n\nSo there wasn't really a question as to what the law was doing.\n\nBut --\n\nPlaintiff: You believe that plaintiffs here could have brought suit immediately in federal court, is that right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nPlaintiff: So, I mean, this is Felder's -- it seems to me there's a lot going on in Felder.\n\nBut one -- its most essential holding is it quotes Patsy, and it says -- you know, Patsy said, too bad about an exhaustion requirement.\n\nYou have to be able to bring suit in federal court immediately.\n\nAnd then -- and this is on page 147 -- it said should there be any different rule with respect to state courts, and it says, given the evil at which the federal civil rights legislation was aimed, there's simply no reason to suppose that Congress meant to have that kind of distinction.\n\nSo, I mean, that seems just like a very clear-cut understanding of Felder, that once we say that the exhaustion requirement does not preclude suit in state courts, we understand -- does not preclude suit in federal court, we understand 1983 to do the same thing with respect to state courts.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "843", "dialogue": "Judge: I'm generally sympathetic to the idea that you don't want to disclose information, national security information, but I think you've said multiple times you already do that when the case goes to the merits in these kinds of situations.\nSo I'm not sure that's a particular concern if you have to do it in a few more cases to establish mootness, but correct me if --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, if you accept Respondent's submission in this case or the Ninth Circuit's, it's not just going to be a few more cases; it's going to be literally anyone who's ever on the No Fly List, the claims could never moot out unless we --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- revealed the information, then, you know, there is a point of minimization.\nEven, you know, when we have to reveal the information --\n\nJudge: I agree.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- we do it, but we don't want to -- that doesn't mean we do it all the time.\n\nJudge: I -- I'm very sympathetic to that, so I -- I accept that. Okay.\nOn the -- on -- I'm sympathetic to your mootness argument, although I might not have sounded like it, but the reason I'm having trouble is to squeeze this kind of situation into the test we use I find very -- very difficult.\nSo -- and there are two different kinds of scenarios someone could come off the No Fly List that I think might affect how at least I instinctively look at this.\n\nOne would be we made a mistake, it's the wrong name, person had the same name.\nThis happens.\nAnd someone comes off the No Fly List because it was some -- you know, you had nothing to do with anything and your name was the same as someone who does, okay? If you said that, then mootness seems like very easy to establish under the standard that we have.\nWhen it's this kind of, well, connecting the dots situation, it's much harder, I think, to squeeze it into reasonably expected to recur because we just have no idea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\nSo two -- two responses to that. One, I -- I think you hit the nail on the head with the dynamic nature of these things.\nIt's not like, you know, the churches either are or aren't entitled --\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- to a grant under the First Amendment.\nThe union fees either are or aren't, you know, chargeable under the First Amendment. Here, it's -- it's not static like that.\nIt's not like, if you're an individual, you either always belong on or always belong off the No Fly List.\nIt's at the moment, do you pose a threat of engaging in terrorism.\nAnd an individual might pose that threat before 2016, not pose it since 2016, and, you know, in -- in 2050 might pose it again.\nWho knows? But you can never know that, right? And I think that you're right, that is a distinction here.\nAnd so then the second part of my answer is I think we need to remember that voluntary cessation is a judge-made exception to Article III.\nWe're still -- we're always implementing Article III.\nAnd I think, therefore, it's critical not to stray or become untethered from the purposes of the voluntary cessation doctrine and why this Court developed it.\nIt was to prevent gamesmanship and docket manipulation to avoid judicial review, post-certiorari maneuvers, other sorts of things.\nThat's not what's going on in this case.\nWe did not take him off the list in an attempt to evade judicial review.\nAnd I think that should be the touchstone for how you apply the reasonable expectation of recurrence or whatever the language is for voluntary cessation.\nDon't untether it from the purposes for which the doctrine was developed, because, at all times, it -- mootness should not stray so far from Article III that they become completely disconnected.\nAnd, here, he's not on the list.\nHe hasn't been on the list in eight years.\nThere just simply isn't a live case or controversy about his placement on the No Fly List any longer.\nAnd in the unlikely event he's put back on the No Fly List in the future, he can bring a challenge at that time.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. [Defendant's Lawyer], could you address the claim made by Respondent and some of the amici that the government, in fact, is strategically mooting these cases by dismissing them?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\nWe strongly disagree with that, and I don't think the evidence they cite actually supports the claim.\nI think the ACLU's brief is probably the most comprehensive on this front, but if you look at the ACLU's brief, what they say is -- you know, sometimes, I -- I think it's about half or something like that, roughly, of these plaintiffs are removed from the No Fly List during the litigation.\nOf course, that's the -- that's how many U.S. persons are removed from the No Fly List, just based on the administrative redress process, which is what we think is happening.\nSo ACLU documents that, well, some of these plaintiffs are removed before any briefs are filed, and then some are removed after the briefs are filed but before a district court decision.\nAnd then some are removed after the decision.\nSome are removed on appeal.\nAnd I look at all that and I think, well, that makes sense because they're removed as an outcome of the administrative redress process and where the agency takes a fresh look at the file and says we now no longer believe they pose a risk of engaging in the terrorist activities.\nIf we were strategically mooting, you might expect the removals to all come at, like, the same point in litigation or with a certain kind of litigation trigger.\nBut that's just not what's going on at all.\nAnd, of course, we have litigated several No Fly List claims to judgment, which wouldn't make sense if we were trying to engage in strategic mooting.\nSo I think, if you look at the universe of cases, what is apparent is that in all of the cases cited by Respondent and I think in ACLU's appendix, redress proceedings were in parallel to the litigation, and I think it's natural to expect that sometimes those individuals will be removed as a result of the redress process.\nI strongly dispute any notion that we're engaged in strategic mooting, and we have filed declarations from people occupying the same position as Courtright, not in this case but in follow-on cases, that say we never place someone on the No Fly List or remove them from the No Fly List because of litigation concerns.\nAnd I think that's entitled to deference and -- and respect.\n\nJudge: So I just want to be clear.\nAre you asking for a special mootness rule for the national security context?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: Are we doing some sort of a carveout for national security?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, quite the opposite.\nI -- we rely extensively, I didn't think it was possible to rely more heavily, on a case than we do on -- than on Already.\nThat was a case involving private parties.\nWe think exactly the same rule applies.\nWe do think the national security context does matter for an evaluation of the facts on the ground.\nI think it's Respondent who would have a heightened rule for government officials.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

To be clear, we don't think that in the indictment we actually need to charge what the specific predicates are.\n\nJudge: No, but you did in this information.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We -- we did in this information, but I don't think that --\n\nJudge: And wouldn't the --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- given that he had -- he has a fairly long rap sheet --\n\nJudge: No, I understand that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- I don't --\n\nJudge: But do you think a defendant might make a reasonably different choice if he knows what -- what the -- I may be able to have a good occasions clause argument with respect to these crimes but not those crimes? And -- and the ones you chose are different than the ones you're now seeking to pursue.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, to be clear, Your Honor, we charged them, as I read the information, as -- I mean, it put him on notice of the ACCA because it cited --\n\nJudge: You did.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It put him on notice of the ACCA, but it was also in support of the basic underlying 922(g) offense. In addition, I think he is fairly charged with knowing --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- his own prior conviction history.\n\nJudge: And then, on that, in response to earlier questioning, you admitted, I think, that there are some situations in which a jury could reasonably find that a series of crimes happened on the same occasion even though they happened over the span of some days. At least in a jury trial, you've got all the facts before you. Here, we have just the pleading documents from those prior cases. How is a judge -- how are we supposed to have a hundred percent confidence that it's harmless that these were, in fact, on separate occasions when there's been no trial and all we have before us are these pleading documents?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, first of all, Your Honor, I -- I don't think we look at it quite as that there has been no trial. It's that the --\n\nJudge: Well, there's been no trial.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- the entire record here would encompass the sentencing proceedings. This is the same error the Court considered in Neder, where an element was erroneously presented to a judge but not a jury. And, here, you have the record. We have the documents.\n\nJudge: But we don't know what the defendant would say. He might say it was all part -- I -- I did this crime to commit that crime, to commit the third crime, just as you posited earlier. We don't know what he would say with respect to whether these three crimes that you wound up using are part of a single occasion or different ones.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, now that we've expanded the different occasions inquiry into a fundamentally factual one, that's the holding of Wooden, I think looking at what the defendant precisely did, it doesn't remotely support an argument of that sort. And also, the idea that -- I -- I -- I -- I would resist the idea that it's part of a common scheme or plan simply just to undertake a string of robberies within a week. Like, clearly, he had the means to do the first one, to do the second one, and to do the third one. He had several days in between to cool off. He did not -- and on the last day, he robbed two stores, Druther's and Schnitzelbank. If you want to look at the sentencing memorandum, the government's sentencing memorandum, at page 6, those are fairly far apart from one another. I don't really think he has any viable argument, and I don't take debt, simply a debt, to be an argument. Otherwise, a gambling addict could constantly be on the same occasion.\n\nJudge: It seems to me probably right, but we have to decide whether it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and we don't have anything from the defendant here with respect to his views about why this might be a single occasion, and I'm just wondering how we're supposed to do that, but --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your -- Your Honor, I think we do because this issue was litigated before the judge, notwithstanding his objection.

{"id": "358", "dialogue": "Judge: So, Mr. Dvoretzky, just to be sure I understand your answer to the previous question, is it that the due process right to the hearing is tied to the innocent owner defense, and if there were no innocent owner defense, there wouldn’t be a right to a retention hearing?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think if there were no innocent owner defense—first of all, we’re not asking the Court to go beyond holding that there is a due process right where there is an innocent owner defense. And, in fact, we’re not even asking the Court to go that far because we’re only asking for the methodological holding about whether to apply—\n\nJudge: Because the methodological—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —Mathews or Barker.\n\nJudge: I understand that, but does the methodological question—even in your view—does a court even need to ask the question of whether a retention hearing is due if there’s no innocent owner defense?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it does because, even in that context, I think there is a difference between the claim about a final determination and the speed of the final determination in previous cases versus the interim deprivation that’s at issue here. But I think it’s a lot clearer that those cases don’t speak to the question presented when, as here, you have an additional substantive right created by state law that wasn’t at issue in those earlier cases. And as this Court’s due process jurisprudence makes clear, when states create substantive rights, that can also give rise to additional due process protections—\n\nJudge: But does it even—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —that are required.\n\nJudge: —make sense to ask this question? I mean, you point out that one precedent rather than another is the more apt analogy, but you don’t get a hearing on the probable cause determination. So, as the state points out, you’re asking for more process, more robust process in the context of civil forfeiture than a criminal defendant gets.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: A couple of points on that, Your Honor. First of all, the point of our reliance on that precedent is simply to show that even in the criminal context, one test is not the overarching test that applies in all circumstances. Even in the criminal context, it doesn’t speak to every constitutional issue that could come up having to do with timing. And just as those cases don’t speak to every issue, previous rulings don’t necessarily settle the due process claim here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: With respect to the argument that under our view, property is somehow getting greater protection than persons, there’s a panoply of protections under criminal law that defendants get. In this case, and particularly where you have an innocent owner defense, there has not even been any sort of probable cause determination made by the police at the time of the seizure about the innocent owner defense. The police here are seizing the car incident to arrest. They’re not even making a determination at that point about who owns the car and whether that person has a probable claim of innocence.\n\nJudge: Do you think that the innocent owner defense is required by the Constitution?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: This Court has held that it is not, in a previous case, so no.\n\nJudge: All right. If the state creates that, could it allocate the burden of proof to the owner of the car?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it could, and under Alabama law, in the pre-2022 version, the burden of proof was allocated to the owner of the car, whereas under the current version, the burden of proof is allocated to the government.\n\nJudge: And could it say that the owner of the car must prove innocence by clear and convincing evidence?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it could if that were the law.\n\nJudge: If the retention hearing has to occur within 48 hours of the seizure, you didn’t mention a time in your argument this morning. You said \"reasonably prompt.\" How— Is it practical to expect the police to be able to prove within a short period of time that the owner of the car did not know that the person driving the car was going to have drugs in the car?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, first, I do think that \"reasonably prompt\" is the standard. The way that lower courts have interpreted that is generally a few weeks. We’re not asking for the 48-hour standard under previous rulings, although, to another judge’s question, that is another example of where we are not actually asking for more protection for property than for people—\n\nJudge: What does \"a few weeks\" mean? I’m sorry to interrupt. What does \"a few weeks\" mean?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The Sixth Circuit in a recent case said two weeks. In New York, for certain hearings, they have to happen within 10 business days, which is two weeks as well. I don’t know that it is a rigid line at two weeks. I don’t think this Court needs to decide a particular day at which it needs to happen, but it needs to happen reasonably promptly on a scale measured by weeks rather than months or years, which is how civil litigation ordinarily happens.\n\nJudge: Are you asking us to decide that in this case, though? Because I thought we were only deciding which test applies to determine whether or not there is a procedural due process claim here. I didn’t understand us to be answering the question of how many weeks are necessary, but maybe I’m confused.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor, you understood correctly. The question presented is simply about which methodology, which test applies to determine whether a hearing is due, not—\n\nJudge: And whichever one we decide, we could remand it for the lower court to actually apply it in this case to determine whether or not there was a procedural due process violation, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Absolutely.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Assume—we do know that English common law provided post-seizure process separate from the final forfeiture hearing.\n\nWe don't have a similar history in early American courts for all the reasons the opposing counsel raised, largely because, except for pirate ships and some isolated other types of seizures, we don't have a robust forfeiture process until the 1970s.\n\nSo, if the common law doesn't have a clearly established process, does that mean no process is ever due, or does it mean that we have to judge it by the circumstances that exist in modern times? I would think it's the latter.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I think the history is a lot clearer and a lot clearer in our favor than suggested. We agree with a lot of the premises that in Slocum and an early Judge Hand decision, there is a requirement to institute or return.\n\nWell, that sounds like Barker to me. Institute promptly, conclude promptly. There is not a history of a mini-trial, despite having a history in the liberty context with something like a precursor to the Gerstein hearings.

If you get in front of the judge quickly, he can consider all those factors.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then, on Barker and Mathews v. Eldridge, the Solicitor General in particular suggests that those really are ultimately the same, materially the same thing in this context, asking the same questions.\n\nDo you agree with that or not?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We see a little more daylight between the tests, but we do agree that in these cases, they would result in the same outcome. That’s what the Southern District of Alabama held in this case, that under Mathews or under Barker, the petitioner loses.\n\nJudge: Suppose we have no precedent on point and suppose we have no idea what the history says, just a complete blank slate.\n\nAnd suppose we're using Mathews v.

I would point you to this Court’s opinion in Kaley, where they considered the significant interests the government has in not having to try their case repeatedly.\n\nIn the forfeiture context, movable property can disappear, be hidden, or be misused again. You don’t want to turn the car back over to someone who just allowed it to be used to traffic methamphetamine because there’s at least some chance that it might be misused again or disappear.\n\nSo we think the government’s interests are very strong here. And it’s not clear what additional process is really going to be provided when that retention hearing is going to look a lot like the final hearing—except that it’s going to be rushed, increasing the risk of error.\n\nAnd that risk of error is not just a problem for the public; it’s a problem for other actually innocent owners. If a merely purportedly innocent owner takes the property due to an error, the real innocent owner might lose it.\n\nJudge: Just to finish it out, you would have us figure out whether we agree more with the government or the individual on that? We just have to make a policy call?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, I think that’s part of the problem with Mathews. It’s not all that predictable. The Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, in the context of cars, said you do get the retention hearing. The Fifth Circuit and the Southern District of Alabama in this case said you don’t get a retention hearing for cars.\n\nSo, it doesn’t really give us a whole lot of guidance.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "6", "dialogue": "Judge: Does the case die, though? Let -- let's just -- I'll follow Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.\r\n\r\nJust hypothetical, let's imagine that we adopted the United States' view.\r\n\r\nWould you have any hope of satisfying your burden of production on remand?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We -- we would.\r\n\r\nAnd I would think that we would be able to get jurisdictional discovery into that inquiry if that were the standard that the Court were to adopt here.\r\n\r\nThe way this case proceeded below, again, Hungary's only argument, Hungary didn't dispute expropriation and it didn't make an argument about the fact of liquidation or commingling.\r\n\r\nIt only said, well, it's impossible to trace.\r\n\r\nAnd the way this case was litigated was about whether there was a tracing requirement.\r\n\r\nIf this Court required -- if this Court concludes that Hungary's or the United States' standard is the correct one -- and, again, Hungary has the information about what happened to the property and about its bank accounts --we would at that point be entitled to jurisdictional discovery below to try to establish whatever standard this Court --\r\n\r\nJudge: What would --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- sets forth.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- that jurisdictional discovery look like?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, for starters, it would involve discovery into Hungary's records of what happened in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nWe allege at some length in our complaint that Hungary has extensive records of the expropriation of property and --and how it -- what happened to it after it was expropriated.\r\n\r\nWe would want to get access to those records, which we have tried to get but been unsuccessful in doing so.\r\n\r\nWe would also --\r\n\r\nJudge: I don't understand how that would help you.\r\n\r\nI mean, you know, they have records and they say yes, we took all of these people's money and --and other assets, and the money we put in bank accounts, and the assets we sold and we put the proceeds in bank accounts, and then we spent it.\r\n\r\nI mean, that's what you're going to find out 70 years later, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, and -- and, Justice, the records are actually, I think, a little bit more detailed than that.\r\n\r\nWe already know and have put in the record evidence of particular bank accounts that the money was deposited into.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if this Court were to require us to somehow trace the flow of that dollar from 1944 to today, we would get -- we would need that kind of evidence to know this property was deposited into this bank account and then trace the flow of that bank account through the years.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is the standard that the --the -- the statutory language requires because, again, I think the commingling theory is valid.\r\n\r\nMoney is fungible.\r\n\r\nAll the arguments we've been talking about about the nature of exchange in this context.\r\n\r\nBut, if the Court were to disagree, we'd be entitled to discovery to try to figure out exactly where the dollar went from account to account.\r\n\r\nJudge: Unless the account into which the money was placed was the sort of unlikely special account that was discussed earlier, the --you know, the Holocaust expropriation account, I don't understand how that would -- the kind of discovery you're talking about would help you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think it -- it depends what standard the Court were to adopt. I -- again, I think the right standard here would not require this sort of tracing because, when we're talking about money, it just doesn't make sense to ask where a particular dollar went when all dollars are fungible.\r\n\r\nBut, if the Court were to come up with that kind of a standard, we ought to be entitled to an opportunity to prove it.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nJustice Thomas? Justice Alito, anything further? Justice Kagan?\r\n\r\nJudge: Just one thing. In that discovery, are you deposing officials from the Hungarian government too?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Potentially, yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Just one --\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Jackson?\r\n\r\nJudge: Just one clarification.\r\n\r\nIs the exchange in your argument at the point of the liquidation or the withdrawal? At some point, you were saying withdrawal is when the exchange is occurring.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Both.\r\n\r\nJudge: Both?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Both.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple exchanges that occur in the chain.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thanks.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Rebuttal, Mr. Glasgow?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like to make just three brief points.\r\n\r\nFirst, jurisdictional discovery did occur in this case back in the summer of 2019. We submitted declarations explaining that tracing was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Respondents engaged in some discovery.\r\n\r\nThe district court imposed a deadline to file a motion to compel, and they elected not to do so. Second, there were some questions about what specifically outraged Congress in Sabbatino.\r\n\r\nAnd there's some historical context necessary to understand that.\r\n\r\nAt the time Sabbatino -- the second Hickenlooper amendment was passed, prior to the FSIA, Congress presumed that assets would be in the United States for such a claim to proceed because there was no mechanism to establish in personam jurisdiction over foreign states, and so some asset had to be present in the jurisdiction of the district court in order to -- to proceed with those claims.\r\n\r\nAnd the -- the sort of catchphrase that Senator Hickenlooper used during those debates was that the United States would become a thieves' market unless the second Hickenlooper amendment was passed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, finally, I know the parties have made a number of analogies in this case, and I recognize no analogy is perfectly apt, but if I can offer one more, hewing as closely as I can to the facts of this case.\r\n\r\nImagine that a trial court in a European capital city declared that it had the authority to adjudicate claims for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, claims that could result in a judgment against the United States in the billions of dollars and permit attachment of U.S. property abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd imagine further that this trial court based that authority on the proposition that every dollar the United States spent in the past 80 years was given in return for personal property taken from a few interned individuals.\r\n\r\nThe United States would be outraged and affronted by such a decision.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress passed the FSIA, it knew that exercising jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns creates international friction. That's why it focused on commercial activities consistent with the restrictive view of foreign sovereign immunity, and that's why it imposed a commercial nexus requirement in the expropriation exception.\r\n\r\nThe commingling theory effectively reads that most important part of the exception out of the statute.\r\n\r\nWe ask that this Court reverse.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nThe case is submitted.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "515", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Stewart, that raises a question for me because, like the Chief Justice, I was wondering, what could the OCC do here? And you alluded to that. It's interesting, I'm not sure what to make of this, but in the 13 years or so since Dodd-Frank, we don't have an OCCA rule on escrow accounts, except for the one issued in 2011 immediately after Dodd-Frank, in which it reaffirmed its rule banning any regulation by states on escrow accounts under an \"obstruct or impair\" standard that predated Dodd-Frank. That purported to ratify what it had done before under the old law. And as I took it from a couple of cryptic footnotes in your brief, you're not asking us to defer to that regulation. In fact, you seem to suggest that it's inconsistent with the law and entitled to no respect. Why hasn't the OCC done something here under the law that actually exists?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the OCC did file an amicus brief in the Second Circuit taking—\n\nJudge: The other way.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The other way. And so that—that was what they did. Now I—I would—\n\nJudge: But you seem to have disavowed everything the OCC has done since Dodd-Frank. What do we do with that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I think there are substantial indications in the text and history of Dodd-Frank that, although Congress intended to codify the Barnett Bank standard, it intended to revise or overturn the way that the OCC had been making preemption—\n\nJudge: And then the OCC said maybe you thought so, but, ha, we promulgated it before Dodd-Frank, so you're stuck with it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: And now you're saying, nah, that's not right. And is the OCC going to actually do some of this work at some point under the law?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, as far as I'm aware, the OCC has never issued a case-by-case preemption determination. And I don't know what the reason is, but I would say, if you imagine the OCC trying to do a case-by-case preemption determination with respect to the New York law at issue here, the most straightforward way to do it would simply be to say we have a regulation that says states can't regulate mortgage escrow accounts, this is a regulation of mortgage escrow accounts; therefore, it's preempted. But, if the OCC tried to do it that way, it would run into the provisions of Dodd-Frank that say, when the OCC does these determinations, it considers the impact of the state law—\n\nJudge: In fact, we have exactly the regulation. You say if they did this. They did it. They said there are no escrow regulations that are permissible under state law. They're all preempted. But you're not defending that regulation; you're disavowing it. You've flip-flopped positions on it. And I'm asking, is the OCC ever going to get around to doing that which Dodd-Frank directs it to do?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I think I would say Dodd-Frank authorizes but doesn't direct it to do this. Now, if the Petitioners' position in this case prevails and if the Court holds that some inquiry into practical impacts is necessary with respect to the individual state law, then it's very possible that the OCC will start making these case-by-case determinations because, independent of legal expertise, the OCC has expertise in the way that national banks operate and can bring that expertise to bear in determining whether—\n\nJudge: If it has expertise, why are you disagreeing with its longstanding position?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think the two reasons—well, two or three reasons. The first is that, as I say, we think that the text of Dodd-Frank manifests a disapproval by Congress of the way that OCC had been doing these determinations. The text says case-by-case determinations, and it's really the opposite of an OCC rule that says here are many categories of state laws that can't be enforced at all.\n\nJudge: Even though key members said otherwise?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They were not the key members. They were two members of the Senate who had drafted the Senate version of the preempt—\n\nJudge: I shouldn't have used \"the\" but key members. I shouldn't have used the word \"the.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Okay. They had drafted the Senate version of the preemption provision, and the Senate version contained a general reference to the legal standard in Barnett Bank but didn't use the phrase \"prevents or significantly interferes with.\" And then the House bill had framed the preemption standard as does the state law \"prevent and\"—\n\nJudge: I interrupted you. Keep going with why you changed positions. So one is your reading of the text and history.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That they indicate that Congress wanted the OCC to redo this. I think the second thing that we would say is the way in which OCC's view is currently manifested is in the 2011 regulations, but Congress said the way that OCC is supposed to do preemption determinations going forward is through case-by-case determinations. And, historically, it's been a requirement for deference that the agency act through the procedural mechanism that Congress specified.\n\nJudge: Do you have a view on whether this New York statute constitutes a significant interference with national banking powers?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We don't have a concluded view. Certainly, as the opposing counsel points out, this is something that state banks have been complying with, apparently, without material impairment. I think it would depend in part on evidence or a factual showing about what rate of interest can the banks use on the money in the escrow account because—\n\nJudge: Can I interpret that as suggesting that you're skeptical that it's a significant interference?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "778", "dialogue": "Defendant’s Lawyer: Right, because what Congress was concerned about was the confusing spectacle of competing opinions on mens rea. And even if—I would just add one more thing—even if there were just one expert, if you do want to look at congressional intent, what that intent is clear about is that experts should not be talking about the ultimate issue of mens rea.\nIt's perfectly fine to talk about mental state.\nIt's perfectly fine to talk about experiential facts that lend to inferences about mental state.\nBut the jury’s special role in criminal cases is designed to find mental state in expert—\n\nJudge 1: And then—\n\nJudge 2: But what about—\n\nJudge 1: —and then just to—just to finish up, you know, the—the fact that parties can often get inferences through facts about mens rea and therefore come virtually close to this, is that anything unusual in trial practice? I—I was always taught there's always a way to skin the evidentiary cat, and I can come up with a whole bunch of facts that—to suggest that somebody does or doesn’t have a mental state.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, that’s exactly right.\nAnd, of course, the prosecutor at closing can connect all of the dots and make an argument to the jury.\nSo I’m not here to make a big dramatic argument, but I am here to make a meaningful argument about testimony that’s this explicit about the defendant’s mens rea.\n\nJudge 2: Well, that—actually, Judge 1’s question brings up one that I had, is what about your client’s own expert testimony in this case, you know, an expert who says there’s no way for someone to suspect or know that the car has drugs in it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think, Your Honor, that particular sentence of our expert’s testimony crossed the line of Rule 704(b), but, remember, the trial judge had already ruled at that point that Agent Flood’s testimony was admissible and had construed the rule in the way the Ninth Circuit does—to bar only explicit opinions about the defendant herself.\nSo the defendant was playing under the same rules that the prosecution was playing under.\nWe agree on a retrial that that particular statement would be out.\n\nJudge 2: That that would have to stay out? And what about framework evidence, that the evidence professors say framework evidence is valuable and it comes in in most cases, and, you know, your average juror is probably not going to understand how cartels work? So it would be valuable, I would think, to say things like, well, you know, cartels like to know where the car is going to be parked on the other side of the border so they know where to find the drugs.\nThis is the value of the drugs.\nSo this is how cartels—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge 2: —do it.\nSo the evidence professors say this would be a terrible rule because framework evidence is valuable.\nDo you—what rule do you see for the kind of framework evidence?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think the—the professors just misunderstand our rule.\nAnd we’re, again, not advocating something out of thin air.\nIt’s the Fifth Circuit’s own doctrine that we’re—that we’re advocating here.\nAnd that doctrine makes clear all the stuff you just posited is perfectly admissible because, again, it’s—there—there’s no statement about mens rea in those sentences you just read me.\nThey’re just facts in the world that make it highly likely or unlikely a person had a mens rea, but it’s not statements about knowledge to use the mens rea in this case.\nAnd—and this brings me back—\n\nJudge 3: But, Mr.—Mr. Defense Lawyer—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —to Judge 2—\n\nJudge 3: —Mr. Defense Lawyer, sometimes statements about knowledge are actually important for the defense.\nYou suggested that in this case the defense put that evidence in sort of because they were living in the world that the court had already established.\nBut one of the things the evidence professors talk about is that if you exclude this kind of evidence, you could have a situation in which you have a battered spouse who assaults the person who is beating them, and they’re not going to be able to put on expert evidence that negates mens rea in that situation.\nWhat do you say about that? It seems to me this is not all net positive for the defense.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think this is the flip side of the exchange I had with Judge 1.\nThe defendant in that situation can put on an expert to talk about the phenomenon of battered women syndrome.\nThat expert could testify about the cycle of violence and learned helplessness and the features of battered women syndrome.\nThe only thing the expert could not do is say, I think this defendant or people in her position would not have had the requisite mens rea.\nBut then, at closing, the defendant can make that very argument.\nIt’s just direct expert testimony about the precise element of the crime—the mens rea element of the crime—that is barred by Rule 704(b).\nSo, again, I don’t have some broad—\n\nJudge 3: But is there a difference between saying the defendant herself didn’t have the mens rea or women in this situation didn’t have the mens rea?\nI guess that’s what I’m not understanding about your argument.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that those two things are both covered by the rule.\nNow the—and even the government—\n\nJudge 3: Both covered by? But I thought that’s what you just said they could get up to the line of saying.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, no, no.\nI think they—they could describe women in the situation of battered women syndrome and what those symptoms are and what those features are of that—of that condition, but the expert could not testify as to whether or not a person with that condition would have had the mens rea to commit this crime.\nIt’s just the mens rea testimony.\nIt’s not mental state testimony—mental condition testimony more generally", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

You didn't have that status.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because the Hobbs Act itself incorporates the Atomic Energy 2339 provision that I quoted to you about being a person affected by the license, requesting a hearing, that we shall be admitted.\n\nSo the Hobbs Act party --\n\nJudge: Did you make that argument before the court in your intervention -- wasn't that the basis by which you went to the court and said: I need to intervene, look at the Hobbs Act provision that says these things?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nWhat we did in the D.C. Circuit was we talked -- and -- and the D.C.\n\nCircuit, by the way --\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, that's not the statutory basis for your claiming the right to intervene?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: It is.\n\nIt is.\n\nJudge: It was, right? So you said to the court: Look at the Hobbs Act. Here are these criteria we need to be able to intervene.\n\nAnd the court disagreed.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think you're misreading what happened in the D.C. Circuit, Your Honor, with respect.\n\nWe didn't have an opportunity to challenge the final order in the D.C.\n\nCircuit.\n\nThat could only be done after the final order was made.\n\nSo what we did challenge was the limited application of the Commission's intervention rules to say they had not been applied correctly.\n\nJudge: Mr. Frederick --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's a much more limited question.\n\nJudge: -- it makes little sense.\n\nThe rule at issue that you wanted to intervene in was a rule that was citing a -- a storage area that you now say they didn't have the authority to do.\n\nSo, if you were an aggrieved person under the Act, you could have gone to the D.C. Circuit on your first round of appeal and said just that: I can intervene because I have an argument that they've exceeded their statutory authority.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And the D.C. Circuit 20 years before had rejected that argument. There was no circuit split.\n\nJudge: Oh, so then you could have sought cert here.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And there was no circuit split, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: You didn't have to, but you -- but the Hobbs Act requires you to be a party aggrieved, not a person aggrieved.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Let me just say, Your Honor, if the Court adopts that line of reasoning, the NRC is effectively immune from judicial review because they set the rules for determining what can be an \"admissible contention\" which has to meet -- surpass the summary judgment standard.\n\nJudge: Well, I take that point, Mr. Frederick, and it might very well be that this D.C. Circuit decision is wrong.\n\nI mean, it -- it -- it looks to me as though it goes beyond the statute.\n\nSo I -- I'm pretty sympathetic to that view.\n\nAnd yet I'm still sort of hung up on the idea that in this proceeding, at this moment in time, that's not before us.\n\nOnly whether you were a party is before us.\n\nAnd any way I sort of think about it, you weren't a party.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, I would ask you to reread the language of 2339 of the Atomic Energy Act, which says we are a party.\n\nAnd -- and if you're going to apply normal textual canons of strict construction, you would say we are a party.\n\nJudge: I think that language says you should have been included as a party. I think that language gives you a good reason for saying that -- that the regulation is invalid and a good reason for saying that the D.C.\n\nCircuit is wrong.\n\nBut I don't think that language gives you a good reason for sort of just, you know, making X not X, that you weren't there.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, I don't think that the Fifth Circuit's ruling that we were a party that should be allowed to challenge the statutory authority of the agency would deny us party status now.\n\nAnd I -- I do want to emphasize the time point.\n\nAs Your Honor pointed out, this license can have this storage for up to 80 years.\n\nAnd under the reasoning of that line, no one would ever be able to say, well, you know that -- that nuclear stuff in the west Texas area was done illegally because no one had the appropriate party status because the intervention rules of the NRC said you don't get to intervene.\n\nThat would be a very crazy way to think about limitations on agency authority that exceed what the statute allows.\n\nAnd I think that if you consider the other side's argument, onsite storage has to be done for safety reasons.\n\nThe -- the nuclear material that is burned, it is very, very hot.\n\nIt has to stay onsite.\n\nAnd that's why the facilities license provisions are the easiest way to understand the practical reality that, for 70 years, this material has stayed onsite.\n\nWhen Congress considered in the Policy Act what to do with it, it said either --\n\nJudge: Mr. Frederick, what do we do about the fact --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- keep it onsite --", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "435", "dialogue": "Judge: Why -- why doesn't bifurcation take care of all the problems from your perspective?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think for a couple of things, Your Honor. I think, first, bifurcation is -- is extremely rare in criminal cases. I think the other side has cited only two contexts in which it occurs regularly. One is the death penalty context, where it's required by statute. The other is the criminal forfeiture context, where it's required by rule.\n\nAnd I think, here, it's going to be discretionary. And I don't think they've cited you a case in -- or a context in which discretionary bifurcation happens as a matter of course. And I do think that the -- because it's discretionary, the government is, I think, going to have good arguments against bifurcation in at least some cases.\n\nI would think if I were the government I would argue that the government has a right to present all of its evidence on all of the elements of the crime to a single jury, so that that jury can make a moral judgment about whether this defendant has committed the crime as defined by Congress, and the defendant doesn't have the right to sort of hide an element from the jury on the first go around and then show it to the jury in a bifurcated proceeding.\n\nAnd I think there already is some evidence of this. So we cite the Harrell case at page 466 of our brief. That's a case in which the government -- the prosecutor opposed bifurcation post-Wooden. The judge denied bifurcation. And then the -- the defendant was forced to stipulate to the occasions question.\n\nAnd the jury was told, this is a three-time convicted felon, and then the prosecutor at closing told the jury this is a drug-slinging, gun-toting, three-time convicted felon. So I think that shows that when prosecutors decide they don't want to bifurcate, judges may well agree with that. And that when they don't bifurcate, it's going to be seriously prejudicial to defendants.\n\nJudge: Well, of course, part of their answer is that this will be an incentive for the defendants to plead.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think that's right but I think that goes to my point, which is that this is prejudicial whether it's -- it's -- if it forces the defendants to plead to worse deals or it forces them to go through non-bifurcated proceedings in which these prior convictions are paraded before the jury.\n\nJudge: There are a lot of occasions in which a defendant might love to have a bifurcated proceeding because jurors don't usually think like lawyers who are open to arguments in the alternative, so if the, you know, if the defense is going to be \"I didn't do it, but if I did it, I didn't have the intent that is necessary under the statute,\" it might be really beneficial to have a trial first on the actus reus and then have a separate trial later on the mens rea.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think there's no doubt the defendants are going to want to have bifurcated trials. I think the question is whether the government is going to want to. And the prosecutor said at least the federal government is going to be willing to do that in most cases, apparently not all cases, but most cases.\n\nBut I don't think there is any guarantee that -- this is going to apply to the states, whatever this Court says in this case is going to apply to the states too. And I don't think there is any guarantee that state prosecutors are going to feel the same way. In fact, I would think, I mean, I would think this is going to be a pretty significant piece of leverage that prosecutors can use against defendants to say either plead to a worse deal or we're going to try to get this in front of a jury, and that is seriously prejudicial.\n\nJudge: Do you think it is the right historical question to ask whether there was an established precedent on the narrow question, whether recidivism questions, whether the question whether the defendant had committed other offenses in the past, was recognized as an exception at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment?\n\nOr would the broader question be more appropriate, which was whether it was well understood at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment that judges could make discretionary sentencing decisions, which would take into account prior criminal convictions?\n\nAnd if it's the broader question, the historical evidence is extremely strong, as distinguished scholars have pointed out.\n\nAt the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, the -- the first Congress, which sent the Sixth Amendment to the states, also adopted the first federal criminal proceedings. And contrary to the suggestion in Apprendi, they didn't say if you commit -- if you commit burglary, you get five years imprisonment.\n\nNo, they said if you commit such and such an offense, you shall be sentenced to no more than a certain sentence, which gave the trial judge discretion.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So to be candid, Your Honor, I think there are two lines of history here.\n\nOne is the history you just referenced which is that judges have an enormous amount of discretion to, you know, change sentences within a sentencing range. The other is the Apprendi line of history, which is that generally speaking, sentence-enhancing facts about present crimes were treated as elements that had to go to a jury.\n\nAnd so I think the relevant historical question is: was there a uniform understanding about sort of which box the recidivism-related facts fell into? And I think the answer is no.\n\nI think the answer is that there were at least eight states that we've identified going back to the early 1800s, that -- where legislatures had discretion to treat recidivism as an element of the offense or not.\n\nAnd that's because recidivism was different than facts about present crimes. It went to punishment only, not guilt. And in putting that recidivism -- those recidivism facts before a jury would seriously prejudice the defendant.\n\nSo I think that --\n\nJudge: Counsel.\n\nJudge: When we start talking about history, I get very annoyed because in every history, there are exceptions.

{"id": "532", "dialogue": "Judge: They take the property, they sell it. We have money.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: And that would qualify as any property exchanged --\r\n\r\nJudge: Exchanged for, correct.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- for such property.\r\n\r\nJudge: First step, exchanged for. So then the money goes into either a separate account or a commingled account.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\r\n\r\nJudge: And then, once it's in a commingled account, I understood the United States' argument to be that unless you can trace it -- and maybe I'm wrong?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: Trace it to the money they're pointing to today, you don't satisfy the statute?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: That's basically right. I mean, once that cash is in a large account and there's lots of deposits and withdrawals, it loses its distinct identity.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: And, at that point, then no property, whether it's in the United States or not, could be deemed to have been exchanged for the original property. It's as if the original property had been lost or destroyed, and so --\r\n\r\nJudge: I guess I -- thank you. I mean, I guess my only point is, if the original property is lost or destroyed, the exchange was still made originally. We identified the exchange, and then it's lost or destroyed. The problem is we can't trace it to what you're pointing to today, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: I think we're saying the same thing.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: They're equivalent. But -- but the --\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- the notion of tracing has to come from the word \"exchanged for.\" I think that's --\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- the way to get there.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hungary and MAV lack immunity for stealing Respondents' property during the Holocaust. First, the expropriation exception applies when a foreign state or instrumentality possesses the expropriated property or any property exchanged for such property with the required commercial nexus with the U.S.\r\n\r\nHungary and MAV stole Respondents' property while forcing them onto cattle cars. When Hungary and MAV liquidated Respondents' property, they exchanged that property for money. And when money is commingled, a withdrawal from commingled funds is an exchange for earlier deposits. So, when Hungary used commingled funds to pay interest and buy equipment in the United States, it put into the United States property that had been exchanged for the expropriated property.\r\n\r\nFor MAV, an instrumentality, the analysis is even simpler. The property doesn't have to be in the U.S. MAV deposited money exchanged for Respondents' property into funds it continues to hold, and that satisfies the exception given MAV's commercial activity here.\r\n\r\nSecond, Hungary would nullify the expropriation exception by limiting it to barter economies and inept regimes, hardly the threats that Congress targeted. The expropriation exception is already limited because it requires that the taking violate the international law of expropriation, which doesn't reach domestic takings. Moreover, this case is the rare case where the historical record shows the defendants' practice of liquidating and commingling.\r\n\r\nI'd like to briefly address the two tests that I heard Mr. Joshi and Mr. Glasgow propose. The government proposes a test whether property retains its distinct identity. But, because money is fungible, as soon as it is commingled, at that point, it loses its distinct identity. So, under the government's test, commingling would be a roadmap for escaping the FSIA's jurisdictional hook.\r\n\r\nMr. Glasgow argued the item at the beginning and the end have to be given in return for one another. That's exactly what happens when you have a series of exchanges involving money. I welcome the Court's questions.\r\n\r\nJudge: You know, that's understandable, but, if the account is one for one, you reduce the property to funds and you hold that fund into a -- a marked account, that's understandable. But, when you put the funds in an undifferentiated or general account, how do you say that the funds in that account are all exchanged for the property?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice, I think the answer to that has to do with the fungibility of money. When somebody deposits money in a bank, they get an IOU, in effect, a credit.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: A withdrawal is then an exchange of that IOU for money in the bank, but it's not -- they're not getting the same money. They're not getting the same bills. The money has worked its way through the banking system. The bank has lent it, has used it, has done whatever with it. But they're getting money back for the IOU.\r\n\r\nThe account always has more money in it than it would have had but for that initial exchange, setting aside the possibility of bankruptcy or the account zeroing out somehow. The account always has more money in it. And, therefore, when there's a withdrawal later in time, that withdrawal can be understood as being an exchange for the expropriated funds that were put in in the first place.\r\n\r\nJudge: But the funds are not simply from that exchange. You could have Justice Barrett's funds from Justice Gorsuch's car, you could have people's retirement accounts in that general fund, and the funds from the property. So it's not merely the exchanged property -- the funds from the exchanged property.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That is, of course, the nature of commingling, that when you put the expropriated funds in with other funds, you have both there, but, because the funds don't have a distinct identity because money is fungible, when you take the money out, it is perfectly natural to understand that you are taking out funds that are attributable to the funds that were there before.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, how would you distinguish an account that is solely -- let's say that someone, Hungary, set up a stolen prune account, and you could trace it. How does that -- how would that be different from a general account?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I do think that if you had a segregated account, if you had a Holocaust theft fund account --\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- that was totally segregated from any other general funds that the defendant had, that would be a different situation. You'd be able to say those funds are just in this one place. But, as soon as they are commingled, at that point, you can no longer differentiate the illicit funds from the funds that were there before. And the law recognizes this in a number of different areas.\r\n\r\nThis is why, for example, in the in rem cases, in a civil asset forfeiture proceeding, a district court doesn't lose in rem jurisdiction just because forfeited money is deposited in a bank, enters the banking system, and in a sense leaves the jurisdiction where the money was seized. In the money-laundering cases, as the Fourth Circuit, for example, recognized in the Moore case, when that's talking about monetary transactions in criminally-derived property. The government doesn't bear the burden to prove that no untainted funds were used after illicit funds are commingled with other funds.\r\n\r\nJudge: Counsel --\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

It's because the other federal avoidance powers convey all the ways that Congress wanted to give federal rights to avoidance.\n\n544(b) does something different.\n\nIt recognizes that sometimes out there in the real world, an actual creditor has that right.\n\nAnd Congress picked that up with requiring an actual creditor in 544(b).\n\nBut I wanted to also address the point that you said where you said that we think that this is what the text means.\n\nIt's not what we think the text means.\n\nIt's how this provision, 544(b), has been interpreted for over a century. It is uniform case law --\n\nJudge:\nWell, that -- that's why we're here, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo.\n\nWe're here on the 106(a) question.\n\nWe're here on --\n\nJudge:\nWell, how the two interact, yeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, kind of.\n\nAll of the cases in the split on 106(a) are all asking how does 106(a) affect that actual creditor requirement.\n\nNone of them are challenging the actual creditor requirement.\n\nIf you look at all those cases, for instance, DBSI, the case that started this split in the Ninth Circuit, everything about that case acknowledges this.\n\nEveryone agrees 544(b) operates by looking for an actual creditor.\n\nThe question is, when the -- when the defendant is the United States, how does 106(a) affect that analysis? Are you supposed to disregard sovereign immunity that would exist in an actual creditor's suit? Everyone accepted that as a premise because that is how 544(b) has always been understood.\n\nJudge:\nThat's right.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge :\nMs. Dubin, and -- and you -- you say this actual creditor requirement, which everyone acknowledges exists in 544(b), is there for a reason.\n\nAnd I've been struggling with that, and I want your reaction to -- to this. Is it because Congress was making a policy choice related to its concern about the potential disruptive nature of avoidance? So the general trustee avoidance power has a two-year statute of limitations because, when you come in and you void a previously existing transaction involving innocent third parties, that's like a big deal.\n\nThat's causing a lot of disruption in the market. And so, ordinarily, a trustee can only do that for two years after that transaction has occurred.\n\nThere's no such limitation in the 544(b) world in terms of timing, but maybe -- maybe -- this is my theory -- the -- the relevant limitation is this actual creditor requirement, that what's happening there is the trustee gets the avoidance power but only to the extent that an actual creditor could have affected the same kind of disruption in the market by bringing this kind of action on his own.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think you have it exactly right, but I would add one piece to it, and it's why does Congress care that an actual creditor has that right in the real world? And it's because that transfer could be invalidated in the real world as to that transferee.\n\nSo all Congress is doing is saying that the trustee, instead of leaving that right to one creditor alone, he is going to vindicate the principle of equality among creditors, equality of distribution, bring it into the bankruptcy and that transfer can be avoided for the benefit of all creditors.\n\nBut, absent that situation where this transfer is already vulnerable, Congress's policy judgments about repose, about who should be able to avoid a transfer govern, and 548 governs, other than in that situation.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel --\n\nJudge :\nCan I take you --\n\nJudge :\n-- you say in a foot --oh, go ahead.\n\nI think this will be quick.\n\nYou say in a footnote in your brief -- and this follows up on Justice Jackson's question -- that the way this would work for the actual creditor who actually had the claim in the real world is that if the bankruptcy estate is closed and that person is actually still holding the claim, that they could then pursue it, assuming that it was still available.\n\nHow often does that happen?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think it happens.\n\nI don't know -- I can't give you exact numbers, but it certainly can happen.\n\nIt's not some fantasy.\n\nOf course, if the actual creditor has a right that the trustee can invoke and it's used in 544(b), then there will --\n\nJudge :\nThen it's gone.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- no longer be the right outside of bankruptcy.\n\nBut, if, for instance, the trustee doesn't take advantage of that right or runs the statute of limitations within bankruptcy, then the actual creditor will regain the right when the bankruptcy closes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd it's the same for if that -- if the -- if the transferee has the money and then someone at the actual creditor runs and grabs it before the trustee has a chance, then the trustee can't get it because, presumably, there's preclusion that would apply?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

If you have a case in which you have called an expert to describe, for example, color blindness and the -- and that's relevant to an ultimate issue in the case, and the expert wants to come into court and say everyone who has color blindness, this is what follows from that, the expert doesn't need to qualify that testimony in order to circumvent Rule 704(b) --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I mean, you're making this --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- a lot more complicated than I think it has to be. 704(b) says about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition, dah-dah-dah.

And if they wanted to make -- to say that the expert cannot state an opinion, cannot state anything that is relevant to the issue, they would have said so -- they would have said so explicitly.\n\nAnd a lot of these hypotheticals, it seems to me, are taken care of by other rules. I don't know how any expert could say 100 percent of the time this is true. I -- I don't think that's reliable. It's subject to objection under 702.

If -- you know, if an expert says 100 percent of the time this is true, I -- I -- I think that that -- that would be --that might well harm the -- the case of the party who introduces -- introduces that testimony.\n\nBut let me ask you this: There are people who think that there's a lot of chaos in the states that comprise the Ninth Circuit, but, I don't know, until this morning, it hadn't occurred to me that maybe the cause for this chaos is the Ninth Circuit's rule about 704. Do you think that's true?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. We have not seen any practical problems in applying -- in applying the long-standing understanding of Rule 704(b) that we are advocating in this case.\n\nAnd, to your earlier points, I entirely agree with you that many other rules will take care of some of the hypotheticals that we are battering about today. I took the Court to just be interested in how do you define the outer limits of how Rule 704(b) should apply.\n\nOf course, this case doesn't necessarily present any occasion to address those outer limits because the testimony here looked nothing like some of the hypotheticals that we've been discussing this morning.\n\nThe other point I would make, and -- and we advert to this in our brief, Rule 702 itself was recently amended in ways that were meant to discourage experts from overstating the certainty with which they could express their opinions on the stand. Rule 702 and Daubert gatekeeping is really the way that you handle concerns that an expert is stating something in categorical or absolute terms that is just not supportable by the facts underlying the expert's opinion.\n\nJudge: Counsel, have you had any trouble convicting drug mules in the Fifth Circuit?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, and -- and -- and I take your point that this isn't going to be critical testimony in every case or, indeed, in any particular case.\n\nAnd we have instances in which --\n\nJudge: I mean, in this case, for example, the defendant couldn't roll down her window and the border agent well knows that that usually means there are drugs stuffed inside the panels of -- of the vehicle.\n\nRight? I mean, one can draw an inference from that pretty quickly, when she says I can't --I can't roll down my window.\n\nI mean, there -- there's -- in my experience, I mean -- and in the Tenth Circuit, for example, we -- we took as a reliable indication sometimes one -- one contributing factor for a traffic stop was there -- there -- that there are air fresheners in the car, okay? And it was traveling below the speed limit, okay? And in a panel van.\n\nAnd -- and the windows couldn't roll down.\n\nI mean, all the modus operandi evidence in the world.\n\nAnd you can draw inferences from that.\n\nThe one thing the rule says is you can't reach inside someone's head. And it doesn't seem to be a problem in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't -- I don't dispute that. I think you're right. We are convicting defendants of illegally importing drugs into the United States in the Fifth Circuit without this testimony.\n\nAnd -- and so too, I think we could obtain convictions in the Ninth Circuit without this testimony.\n\nAnd we have a harmless error argument here, which, you know, the upshot of that argument is, I think, the other evidence in this case was overwhelming that the defendant knew about the drugs in her car.\n\nNonetheless, this is helpful and reliable testimony, and we think the jury should be allowed to hear it.\n\nAnd -- and I think if you're thinking about the case through the lens of, you know, what is sort of the practical -- the practicalities here, if you adopt Petitioner's rule, on the other hand, it's going to open up a host of arbitrary and difficult line-drawing exercises that I don't think you really had persuasive answers to this morning.\n\nAnd so I think what the Court should do is stick to the text of Rule 704(b) itself, and Rule 704(b) only comes into play when the defendant expresses an opinion about the defendant's own -- excuse me -- when the expert expresses an opinion about the defendant's own mental state.\n\nAnd the testimony here didn't do that. He said in most circumstances, drug traffickers do not entrust large quantities of drugs to people who are unaware of those drugs. He explained why that was true.\n\nAnd he elaborated on cross-examination that, of course, he is aware of some scenarios in which the traffickers may try to use so-called blind mules, and he describes the facts of those scenarios.\n\nAnd they don't meet the facts of this case.\n\nEverything that occurred here occurred in full compliance with Rule 704(b).\n\nAnd we would ask the Court to affirm.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "39", "dialogue": "Judge: General, could I take you back to the line of questioning that you and the other judge were talking about? In your reply brief, on page 18, you discuss a standing appropriation of up to a quadrillion dollars for the President to fund as he deems fit the entire federal government, besides the Army. So just on this question of where your outer limits are and what theory we might use to say there are some limits, what do you want to say about that sort of statute? Would that be a constitutional violation? If so, why so? And why is that different from this?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So that statute, as we understand it, would be completely unprecedented. It would effectively take the whole of Congress's appropriations authority and transfer it to the executive branch. Congress has never done that for the past 230-plus years, and it's hard for me to imagine Congress ever would do that.\n\nBut I think, if the Court were confronted with that issue in a future case, it could well recognize limits, and the limits would come from history. The Court, in any number of separation of powers cases, has said that the fact that a method of structuring government has no historical precedent can strongly counsel against recognizing it as a constitutional way to proceed.\n\nThat was the analysis the Court used in a previous case. It repeated it in another ruling. But that history works both ways. The Court has likewise said that the fact that a way of structuring government is well rooted in history and traces back to the founding is powerful evidence of the contemporaneous understanding of original intent, and that's the box we're in here.\n\nSo I guess I would urge the Court to save for another day whether there's some theoretical possibility that Congress could go too far with a kind of appropriation we've never seen before and instead focus on this particular appropriations law, which we think finds its roots both in text and history.\n\nJudge: Well, I have the same question, basically, that the other judge just asked you.\n\nYour response in your reply brief was an answer to an argument that was made by the plaintiff, where they say:\n\n\"If the Bureau is correct that there is no constitutional limit on Congress's power to pass laws providing funding to agencies, then a single Congress could allocate each year forever up to a trillion dollars to an agency like the FBI or FTC or even up to a quadrillion dollars for the President to fund as he deems fit the entire federal government besides the Army.\"\n\nNow, you answered the latter part of that in your reply brief about the quadrillion dollars, and you just answered that in response to the other judge. You didn't answer the first part of that about providing a very substantial sum of money to an agency like the FBI or the FTC.\n\nSo I just want to understand what you think the limiting principle is. Let's take the FTC, which I think had a budget of $430 million.\n\nSo let's say there's a law that allocates forever up to $1 billion, adjusted for inflation, to the FTC to use as the FTC sees fit. Would that be consistent with the Appropriations Clause?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think, at the outset, if the law said however the FTC deems fit, it's not clear that would count as an appropriation because it's not clear Congress would have specified the purpose.\n\nBut I recognize you can tweak it and say, you know, to carry out the FTC's functions. In that context, I think the hypothetical would effectively be a standing uncapped appropriation because, of course, the FTC would never reach that amount. It would be for a single agency.\n\nAnd we think that that is well grounded in history and, in fact, is how many agencies are funded today, particularly in the financial regulatory space. But, if you have concerns about that principle, here, of course, we have the statutory cap.\n\nAnd the plaintiff says, you know, the cap is illusory, that it's more like the hypotheticals we've just been touching on. But I don't see how they can tenably make that argument when the cap is set at $600 million, adjusted only for inflation, and many of the agencies from which the CFPB inherited its responsibilities have far larger budgets—$1.8 billion for one agency, around a billion for another, and over a billion for another financial regulator.\n\nThis is a meaningful restraint, and I think it just demonstrates that if the Court thinks it's important to have that constraint here, the CFPB is even more under Congress's control than these other agencies.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

This is going back to a previous line of questions.\n\nI totally understand your point, I understand the precedents, but we do have this Almendarez-Torres carveout, and part of this case is understanding its scope and whether or not this kind of thing does fit in it as a matter of precedent or should fit in it, given all of the various ways in which this could go.\n\nAnd one concern I have is that I think when we're talking about two different sets of facts with respect to the jury, there is added complexity.\n\nWhat I mean by that is we have the facts that relate to the charged crime— today's charged crime, in this case, it's the 924(g)— but we also have facts that relate to past crimes that this defendant was convicted of committing.\n\nAnd I guess I'm just trying to understand how today's jury adjudicates past crime facts.\n\nSo are they limited to the record that was presented to the original jury on those facts? Can new evidence come in related to crimes that happened 20 years ago as we try to figure out whether they happened on a single occasion, or how does this work?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, remember, if you bifurcate, the jury's not doing the two things at the same time.\n\nThey're doing the 922(g).\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And then they’re having a separate proceeding.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: In that separate proceeding, I do think other evidence could come in beyond the record that was established in the initial conviction, because the way I think Congress drafted this— “was committed on separate occasions” is an open-ended fact-finding.\n\nJudge: So how do we keep this from being just like mini retrials of the whole— are you saying we have to have the evidence with respect—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, remember—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: You're having that inquiry regardless.

So I think the plain text controls.\n\nWe agree about that.\n\nThe present tense verbs, I think, are intended to indicate that there is jurisdiction presently.\n\nWe focused on the word \"have\" with the colloquy with Judge -- Judge Jackson.\n\nI would also focus on the word \"are.\" There has to be a relationship between the other claims, the state law claims that are related to claims in the action, the federal -- federal claims that are within the Court's original jurisdiction.\n\nIf we amend out those federal claims, they're no longer in the action.\n\nThere's no relationship.\n\nAnd so there's no supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nThat's 1367(a).\n\nThat's the requirement to establish supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nYou don't get to the exceptions in (b) or (c) unless you establish jurisdiction under (a).\n\nJudge:\nI think not logic but experience, you lose, Mr. Lawyer of Defendant, because the experience cuts the other way.\n\nI mean, just the -- this has all -- until the Eighth Circuit came along, the position of the Plaintiffs has always been understood, assumed.\n\nEvery -- everybody thought that that was the rule.\n\nAnd it was a rule which really has no adverse consequences because everybody remands these cases anyway.\n\nIn 99 percent of the cases, these -- these --you know, there's a remand. So, like, what harm is this rule doing? And this rule has existed in every single circuit court for lo these many years.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah, so I respectfully disagree.\n\nThe master principle that I think governs in every context, except the amount in controversy, is that the amended complaint controls.\n\nIf you amend a complaint in state court to add a federal claim --\n\nJudge:\nSo I basically agree with you.\n\nI mean, I basically agree with you on that and not with Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh says it's all arbitrary.\n\nI don't think it's arbitrary.\n\nI think some of the cases that he was talking about is when facts in the world change, but when we're not talking about facts in the world, when we're talking about allegations, I think that the structure is the way you describe it, that we look to the operative complaint, the amended complaint, except in the amount in controversy area, where there are sort of special considerations.\n\nBut -- so I -- I kind of agree with you that if we were creating a system where all the rules cohered, yours is the better rule. But -- but I think on the other side of the table is, look, we have this anomalous rule, but this anomalous rule has been accepted by everybody for many, many years, and it does no harm anyway since most of these cases are remanded back to state court where they belong.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah, a couple of responses to that, Judge.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think that we, meaning this Court, has ever embraced that rule. It's true that the lower courts deserve respectful consideration, but a lot of these cases predate binding statutory text, so I'm not sure that that's dispositive.\n\nAlso, I would respectfully submit that you're the supervisory Court that's most important in our Article III system.\n\nAnd when you're hearing a question for the first time, you ought to adjudicate it correctly, notwithstanding the respectful consideration that you would give to the lower courts.\n\nAnd if you've determined, as it sounds like you have, that from first principles I'm right, the fact that lower courts that obviously can't bind this one got it wrong I don't think is a reason to just say let's go along to get along.\n\nAnd I also think there --\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, you're --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- are --oh, I beg your pardon.\n\nJudge:\n-- you're suggesting that it's kind of the -- the first time the Court's considered the question.\n\nI understand that.\n\nBut you do have Cohill and the Rockhill -- Rockwell footnote to deal with, and I haven't heard a word about those yet.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, here it comes, Judge.\n\nAs Judge -- (Laughter.)\n\nJudge:\nI can't wait. (Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAs -- as Judge Kavanaugh previewed, I don't think that Footnote 6 in Rockwell is anywhere near the ratio decidendi of the opinion.\n\nJudge Scalia was as capable as anyone of making a stray remark.\n\nHe didn't even consider the statutory text of 1367, which both my friend and I agree is dispositive. And the easiest way to tell that it's dicta is, if you cover up Footnote 6, would it make any difference for the adjudication of the rights and responsibilities of the parties? Obviously not.\n\nRockwell would have come out the exact same way and the exact same outcome and judgment would have occurred.\n\nJudge:\nWe have had cases where we came out the other way than every court of appeals had come out, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes, you have, Judge.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Oh, actually, sorry, one more, which is that also not really before the Court, which is that we think that the 30-day deadline is not—is—we agree that it's non-jurisdictional.\nWe think it's not mandatory either, but that—no—no one is asking the Court to decide that particular question.\n\nJudge\nGoing back to Justice Thomas's question about textual basis for your position, are you relying at all on the zipper clause, 1252(b)(9)?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes.\nWe—we certainly are because that is a sign that what we and the government are—are asking for is the sensible way to proceed.\nIt is very clear that Congress intends for there to be judicial review of CAT claims.\nAnd the zipper clause is telling you that everything should come up in one petition.\nAnd how is that to be done? That is to be done by interpreting final to mean what—when the agency is fully concluded with its process.\n\nJudge\nAnd you're getting your proposition that there is supposed to be judicial review of CAT claims from 1252(a)(4)?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nCorrect, which, of course, at least we read Nasrallah to have looked at that provision and—and concluded that Congress did, indeed, intend judicial review of CAT claims.\n\nJudge\nYou've referred to common sense and a sensible way to proceed.\nDo you think that's a characteristic that can be found in our recent related immigration decisions?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI'd rather not comment on that, if I could avoid it.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nBut—but I will say—\n\nJudge\nWell, let me ask you—\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nBut the red light is on.

Justice Alito?\n\nJudge\nI see the red light won't save you from this, my other question.\nWhy don't we just say it's a magic words test?\nYou know, unless Congress says it's jurisdictional, then it's not jurisdictional.\nThese cases are endlessly interesting and they fill up our docket, but I don't know what—what statutory provision that doesn't have the magic words will ever be held to be jurisdictional.\nCan you think of a possibility?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, we know three, of course, Your Honor—\n\nJudge\nWell—\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n—1291—but—\n\nJudge\nThey have historical—they have a historical pedigree.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nExactly.\nI cannot speculate on how Congress might write a statute that would do that, but I would—I would reiterate this particular one, given the structure of the statute and the way the jurisdictional is used elsewhere in the statute, this deadline is—is a straightforward one to conclude it's not jurisdictional.\n\nJudge\nThis statute—oh, I'm sorry.\n\nJudge\nNo, you're up.\n\nJudge\nThis statute is as clear as you can be.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nSome provisions say there's no jurisdiction.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nExactly.\n\nJudge\nThis one doesn't.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "529", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-51, Bissonnette versus LePage Bakeries.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Less than two years ago, in Southwest versus Saxon, this Court carefully examined the text and history of the Federal Arbitration Act's worker exemption, and it held that the exemption applies to \"any class of workers directly involved in transporting goods across state or international borders.\"\n\nFlowers now asks this Court to add an additional unwritten requirement that the worker's employer must sell transportation. According to Flowers, if the thousands of truck drivers who work full-time hauling its goods were only employed by a trucking company that Flowers had hired to do so, then they’d be exempt transportation workers.\n\nBut because Flowers essentially created its own in-house trucking company, it says that those same truck drivers are no longer transportation workers. That distinction has no basis in the text of the statute.\n\nFlowers’ only attempt at a textual argument is its invocation of ejusdem generis, but that argument fails from the start because Flowers can’t identify a single example of the word \"seamen\" ever being defined based on whether a worker's employer sold transportation.\n\nIn fact, if Flowers’ drivers were on boats rather than trucks, under Flowers' own definition of \"seamen,\" they would be seamen. In the words of Saxon, that sinks the company’s ejusdem generis argument.\n\nUnable to rely on the text, Flowers pivots to administrability. But even if this Court could rewrite statutes to make them easier to apply, Flowers' rule is anything but workable. Flowers can't even explain how it would apply in this very case.\n\nThis Court should reject Flowers' attempt to add to the FAA an employer-based industry requirement that is both atextual and unworkable.\n\nI welcome this Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: If this case is decided in your favor, would it affect the separate question of whether or not these drivers are engaged in intrastate deliveries?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: No, I don’t think it would. The only question—as this case comes to the Court—built into the question presented is the assumption that the workers are members of a class of workers engaged in interstate commerce. It wouldn’t affect that at all. The only question here is, assuming that to be true, is there an additional requirement that the individual plaintiffs be employed by a company that’s in the transportation industry?\n\nJudge: So why would the inquiry into the transportation industry be any more complicated than the inquiry into transportation workers?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: By \"transportation workers,\" I take it you mean whether someone is directly involved?\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: So I think there are certainly going to be edge cases about whether a class of workers is directly involved in transporting goods across state or international borders. I would concede that.\n\nBut what Flowers is asking is that we adopt an additional requirement on top of that that wouldn’t obviate that inquiry.\n\nSo take, for example, Amazon. It has trucks traveling across the highway. It has planes in the air. Maybe there’s a difficult question about whether those, say, truckers are directly involved in transporting goods across borders.\n\nBut what Flowers says is, in addition to figuring out that question, we also have to figure out whether Amazon sells transportation. So, you know, how do we know? Do we need discovery into whether it sells transportation? Does it matter who it sells it to? Does it just have to sell it to its customers? Does it have to sell it to other companies? Does it matter how much transportation it sells? Does it matter what percentage of its price is in revenues?\n\nAll of these are going to be difficult questions that are then layered on top of the question you raised, which is already in the text of the statute. And so, in Amazon’s case, for example, it doesn’t get us out of the question you raised. It just adds an additional one on top.\n\nJudge: In your opening, you emphasized the text quite a bit.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: But in ejusdem generis cases, by definition, we’re not following the literal text of the residual clause. Instead, we’re looking at the listed items and trying to discern what connects those listed items, what feature of those listed items is common.\n\nAnd as the Scalia-Garner treatise says, that can be somewhat indeterminate. A difficult position for judges, but we have to try to figure it out.\n\nSo seamen and railroad employees in 1925—one thing that it seems was going on, and I want to get your reaction to, is Congress took them out of this arbitration regime. All workers, all contracts of employment are subject to arbitration. It takes them out, but it takes them out seemingly—you have to look at the legal context, I would think—because they had a separate arbitration regime that already existed.\n\nIn other words, at least as I read the record, and it is murky in parts, I’ll grant you, as of 1925, Congress didn’t want anyone to be outside of arbitration. They wanted Section 2 for most workers and then not for seamen and railroad employees because there was a separate arbitration regime.\n\nWhy, when we look at the common legal context that connects those terms, isn’t that the correct way to look at it? Why is that wrong?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: There are two answers to that.\n\nOne is we know that Congress wasn’t exempting just workers who had alternative dispute resolution regimes because it added the residual clause, and that residual clause would have covered no workers at all at the time.\n\nJudge: At the time, but what Congress was doing, arguably—this is the argument—was contemplating that there would be future industries that would fit in. And in 1936, the airline industry comes in, and those employees are funneled into the same kind of separate arbitration—or the railway arbitration regime. So Congress was accommodating the future.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. The second historical answer to that is, even if this Court were going to try to discern some purpose of the exemption instead of focusing specifically on the text, which is difficult a hundred years later, you know, if you look at seamen, I think one of the assumptions underlying that question is that seamen were going to arbitration—that there was a mandatory arbitration scheme that covered seamen. And that’s actually just not correct.\n\nJudge: So you think Congress in 1925 wanted seamen to be able to go straight to court?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I think that’s exactly right.\n\nJudge: Is there anything to support that?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. If you look at Title 46, enacted in 1925, the same year as the Federal Arbitration Act, what you’ll see is references to the right of seamen to go to court. The Shipping Commissioners Act only applied if, after the dispute arose, both parties agreed in writing to arbitration, which is different from what the FAA requires.\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I—sorry, are you finished?\n\nJudge: Is there any continuing reason—this is just my ignorance, so I’m just curious—we were talking about why in 1925 the regulatory regime existed and whether Congress wanted to funnel some of these transportation workers into alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Is this now just an anachronism, or is there any continuing reason for transportation workers to be exempt?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: So I’ll be quite honest—it’s not entirely clear why in 1925. But if we assume the reason was that transportation workers were crucial to commerce and that their disputes could cause nationwide disruptions, that concern still exists today.\n\nJudge: The Second Circuit did not rely on the district court’s reasoning.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: They did not.\n\nJudge: And so it’s not before us. But the district court argued they’re not transportation workers because they also do office-based work. How do you respond to that?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: There’s a factual answer and a legal answer. The legal answer is…", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "729", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As counsel has made clear, Petitioners view the Section 1 exemption as encompassing any worker directly involved in a good's interstate journey, from the plant worker who loads goods for shipment to the store clerk who unloads them and shelves them.\n\nBut, in Circuit City, this Court said that the Section 1 exemption should be read narrowly and should be interpreted with reference to the ejusdem canon, context, and history, all three of which demonstrate that the exemption is limited to transportation industry workers.\n\nAfter all, in 1925, seamen and railroad employees were defined by the industry in which they work. And that commonality should carry through to the residual clause.\n\nContext and history tell you why this line makes sense. By 1925, Congress knew that labor disputes involving transportation industry workers were different. They were unique. They could cause famines in Chicago.\n\nAnd in response, Congress passed two and only two federal arbitration statutes, one governing railroad employees in the rail industry and one governing seamen, who, under the Shipping Commissioners Act, were limited to those in the shipping industry.\n\nPetitioners can't provide a \"why\" for the enumeration. They can't explain why you would pair railroad employees and seamen together.\n\nAnd they advocate a definition of \"seamen\" that is so broad, it's flatly inconsistent with the notion of a transportation worker and this Court's holding in Circuit City.\n\nThe result: a poor fit. And Petitioners show by example.\n\nPetitioners buy Flowers' bread. They pay Flowers for the product. Then they take title to the bread, and it is only after they take title to the bread that they then move it intrastate in order to sell it to retailers for a profit.\n\nThey are under no personal obligation to move anything. They look nothing like railroad employees or seamen. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: We have looked at the performance of the workers in Saxon, and wouldn't it complicate matters now to look at the entire industry, as certainly the district court did and the Second Circuit did?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: And don't you think—I mean, I thought we foreclosed that.\n\nWe said that we won't look. The argument—part of the argument in Saxon was, well, she, Saxon, is in the transportation industry, therefore.\n\nAnd as I hear you, you're saying, well, Petitioner here is not in the transportation industry, therefore.\n\nAnd we foreclosed that, I thought, in Saxon.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So two points, Your Honor.\n\nThe first was that you have to read those holdings in Saxon in light of the background fact that Ms. Saxon was an airline transportation industry worker.\n\nThe Court presupposed that fact. And as was read from the oral argument, that was accepted fact and part of the background on which the holding was made.\n\nThe second point is the industry-wide holding, and in that part of the Court's opinion, the Court was rejecting Ms. Saxon's argument that it was sufficient for her to fall within the Section 1 exemption just because she was a transportation industry worker.\n\nAnd our argument is not that it's sufficient.\n\nWe think that you have to do the Saxon analysis, but the first question is, is being in the transportation industry necessary?\n\nAnd the answer to that should be yes, because, ever since 1972 in the Second Circuit, the background rule has been that you have to be in a transportation industry.\n\nThat's the Erving decision that predates Circuit City and was on the winning side of the Circuit City split.\n\nJudge: So we have cases from the 1920s in which you didn't have to be in the transportation industry in order to be counted as a seaman.\n\nSo how do you square your position with that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: First, I think Saxon informs what it means to be a seaman, but those cases aren't dealing with the limit here, which is you already have Circuit City, and Circuit City has already held that ejusdem—because of the ejusdem canon, there are implied limits.\n\nAnd one of those implied limits is it's not a limitless seaman.\n\nIt's the seamen who are transportation workers.\n\nAnd I think that's where Petitioners' definition gets in trouble because Petitioners freely admit that their seamen are pirates, they're enemy ship folks, they're on recreational boats—\n\nJudge: I understand that.\n\nJudge: But can I—\n\nJudge: But how do you square that with cases where we have actors aboard a ship being counted as seamen, for example?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Most of those are Jones Act cases, and—\n\nJudge: Well, why does that matter, when Congress was using the word \"seamen\" as I'm sure it was understood at the time that statute was passed?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Two reasons.\n\nThe first is the Jones Act has a broad remedial purpose, and this Court has repeatedly recognized in the Jones Act context that it's reaching to the outer limit of seamen.\n\nThe second is that there's no other federal statute that uses railroad employees and seamen together, and Circuit City says that that list has meaning and that list means that Section 1 seamen are different from other seamen.\n\nThey share a commonality with railroad employees.\n\nAnd this Court held in Circuit City that that commonality is transportation workers.\n\nJudge: Well, but commonality can get very complicated, as the other side said.\n\nI mean, where did the price structure and revenue approach come from?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That was part of the Second Circuit's decision and—\n\nJudge: Yeah, but where did they get it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the Court was looking to characteristics of folks in the transportation industry and giving a more granular approach to what are common characteristics on the facts of this case.\n\nAnd, again, these facts aren't disputed.\n\nJudge: No, no, but I mean, they're not—they're trying to figure out what the transportation industry is.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.

They know that to a certainty, that it's going to be -Subject to Final Review pharmaceuticals, cars, what -- you can name lots of products.\r\n\r\nSo that's a real concern, I think, for me about accepting your theory of aiding -and -abetting liability. And, relatedly, you've referred often to the motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nOf course, as you're well aware, getting past that is often the whole thing.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think we can just rely on the motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nBut the broader point, I'd be interested in your reactions, how we rule for you but don't cause that problem that is identified with great force in the briefs.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nSo let's take Budweiser as an example.\r\n\r\nAs you heard Mr. Francisco say today, if Budweiser had a practice, was alleged to have a practice, of selling bulk quantities of Bud Light to liquor stores that were arranged next to high schools and it was selling more and more into those high schools, knowing that those liquor stores were regularly serving underage students, and, in fact, Bud Light designed it to put out a new can that says Best Prom Ever and sold it right into that high school, that is the allegations in this case.\r\n\r\nIf you have a product manufacturer of a dangerous product that is alleged to have done all of the things knowing who they're selling to and what is being done with that product, then and only then, I think, that product manufacturer doesn't --has a problem. If you look at the examples that are given in PLCAA that aren't at issue in this case, the examples that the congressmen and senators were concerned about in PLCAA were when a car dealer sells a car to someone who later drives drunk, when Campbell's is sued because someone is killed with a soup can.\r\n\r\nThose are the things that PLCAA was concerned about.\r\n\r\nThis case is -- marches through in detail allegations taken as true at this stage that these manufacturers know that they are selling a dangerous product to specific rogue dealers who are -- who are selling to straw purchasers for the cartels across the country.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWhat if a --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nThat's --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- beer -- what if a beer --I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nI cut off your sentence.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nThat's okay.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWhat if a beer manufacturer knows that the per capita beer sales in a small college town are, you know, 50 times more than another town without a college there?

Otherwise, the notice of appeal tolling requirements make no sense, and, otherwise, litigants will be able to bootstrap themselves into appeals of otherwise unappealable orders.\n\nI would like to just address the California law point that -- because it has been suggested that the 1937 enactment of Rule 60 somehow incorporates the corpus of California decisional law.\n\nThere's no indication of that in the advisory committee notes itself.\n\nAnd, of course, California law does not and has never controlled the federal court's ability to review its own judgments.\n\nThat has always been a matter of federal law.\n\nIt goes back to Justice -- Chief Justice Marshall riding circuit in North Carolina in 1803 in Marsh versus Murray.\n\nWe cite that case in our brief.\n\nAnd the Petitioner has no response to it whatsoever.\n\nHe cites two California Supreme Court cases.\n\nThey're both worth noting.\n\nThe Palace Hardware case is a dismissal with prejudice, so it would be final even under the 1946 definition.\n\nAnd the -- the Stonesifer case he cites says --says a proceeding covers -- you know, covers any step in the action seeking court action.\n\nA dismissal without prejudice, a non-suit, is the opposite of that.\n\nIt is a retraction of your complaint.\n\nIt is saying I don't need relief from the court anymore.\n\nJudge \nWhat if that's done mistakenly? I mean, suppose we have a situation in which a person files a suit and then they file a Rule 41 unilateral dismissal, say, a week later, and on a Monday.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, counsel rushes back to the court and says: Oh, my goodness, I made a mistake in filing this notice of voluntary dismissal, I did it in the wrong case.\n\nIs it your position that the court really has nothing -- they couldn't reopen the case under those circumstances?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nIt would -- any relief would not come under Rule 60(b). relief -- Of course, the primary\n\nJudge \nWasn't a proceeding?

The -- the key point is, first, the -- the -- the proceeding is meant to cover the small sliver of conclusive actions, conclusive dispositions, that are not themselves judgments or orders.\n\nSo what might that be?

{"id": "696", "dialogue": "\nJUDGE: Can I ask about the dimensions of your argument in two different ways? I'll give you just a couple of hypotheticals.\n\nSuppose we take this out of the employment context. We're not talking about a benefit of any kind. Is that perfectly okay? Or does that change matters?\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Your Honor, if we're looking at this case by case, then I think it’s time to affirm the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision because it was based on a categorical argument.\n\nBut to directly address your question, we need to determine whether this functions as a rule of judicial administration. If it does, it may resemble Felder and thus be more suspect.\n\nJUDGE: I don't understand. What makes it more suspect?\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: It might depend on factors such as who is conducting the adjudication and what kind of requirements bind them.\n\nJUDGE: It’s set up similarly, but in that case, it’s a police board. Police officers are on these boards, and claimants must go through three different stages before taking their case to court.\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Your Honor, if the process is particularly stringent, it might present issues similar to those in Brown (1949). If it appears designed to minimize liability, we could run into Felder problems.\n\nJUDGE: Let’s assume it’s the same kind of structure, but in a policing context. Same time limits, same procedural requirements—there’s no explicit document stating that this is meant to block valid claims. But it’s not in a benefits context; it’s in a quintessential 1983 case.\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: The Court has held in Howlett and Haywood that neutral rules of judicial administration can serve as a valid excuse for declining to entertain a federal claim. If this is a neutral and jurisdictional rule, then it should be permissible.\n\nJUDGE: But wouldn’t that closely resemble Haywood—a rule that demonstrates hostility toward 1983 claims? There’s no historical precedent requiring such steps for plaintiffs bringing a classic Fourth Amendment 1983 claim.\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: The historical context might be relevant. However, in Haywood, plaintiffs had no access to state court at all. If, under your hypothetical, claimants could eventually reach court, then this Court’s precedent suggests that merely delaying consideration of a claim is different from outright barring it.\n\nFor example, in Johnson v. Fankell, a 1983 qualified immunity defense was denied at the summary judgment stage in Idaho’s trial court. The defendant sought immediate appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court but was denied because 1983 does not grant a right to interlocutory appeal. That’s essentially what the Petitioners are asking for here—a guaranteed right to interlocutory appeal.\n\nJUDGE: I don’t want to derail the discussion, but I do want to ask you about the Plaintiff’s Lawyer’s narrow argument.\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Of course.\n\nJUDGE: Suppose the narrow argument is that there’s no exhaustion requirement in a 1983 case in state court where it is, as a practical matter, impossible or extraordinarily burdensome to obtain a decision. What harm would the state suffer in that scenario?\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: There may still be sovereignty concerns if the statute is interpreted to require state courts to exercise jurisdiction that they have never previously exercised. Even in Haywood, the Court recognized that truly neutral and jurisdictional rules can justify a state’s refusal to entertain a federal claim.\n\nJUDGE: But couldn’t it be that, in cases where the process is a true Catch-22—where obtaining relief is practically impossible—that indicates hostility toward plaintiffs’ claims, warranting a Felder argument?\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Absolutely. Or even a Haywood argument.\n\nJUDGE: Right. We just don’t know if that’s the case here.\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Correct.\n\nJUDGE: In Felder, there was significant discussion about time limits. Here, the time limits are even stricter.\n\nNow, suppose we tighten them further:\n\nInstead of three levels of review, we require five.\n\nBetween each level, claimants must proceed within five days.\n\nAt the final stage, they must file their court claim within five days.\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that the state’s administrative process is so slow that, on average, it takes 10 years to reach court.\n\nAt that point, could we say the process is so onerous that it conflicts with 1983?\n\nLAWYER FOR DEFENDANT: Your Honor, under those circumstances, it could indeed raise a Haywood issue and potentially conflict with 1983. Even if framed as a jurisdictional rule, such a process would start to look more like an attempt to evade judicial review rather than a neutral rule about subject-matter competence.\n\nBut in this case, the process genuinely concerns subject-matter competence. The claims have, since 1935, always been initially adjudicated by hearing officers with expertise in handling these matters. These officers oversee thousands—if not hundreds of thousands—of cases per year.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

{"id": "844", "dialogue": "Judge: Counsel, you've been talking about this costing a lot. It may well be. And I'm interested in the other side's response to the series of questions that are going on now about that limitation. But I understand that in terms of tribal healthcare, it's about one-third of what is spent by the average American on their own healthcare. So it's not as if all of this money is bringing us a luxury healthcare spa. It's actually bringing us to a fairly minimal level of healthcare for tribal members. I still don't understand how your interpretation makes any contract support system costs, or many of them, recoverable at all because you seem to be saying that if you're providing services with a—you have services with a third party like Medicare or Medicaid, why would that then include contracts with a consultant who comes in to do the other services that the contract requires for the government? There's always third-party contract—contract supports that are reimbursed by the government. Why is this any different? They're not providing the service because of Medicaid or Medicare. They're providing the service because of their agreement with the government. This is only a reimbursement. It's not a required service agreement.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I do want to make sure to respond to the point that Your Honor raised in the beginning of your question about the underfunding of Indian health, and IHS, you know, agrees with that and is seeking additional appropriations from Congress but just doesn't believe that upending the funding scheme in this way, in an open-ended way, is what—\n\nJudge: That assumes the answer to the question, which is that it's upending, if it's clear by the text that if you provide services, you'll be reimbursed for them and for contract support. It's the contract doing that, not upending it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, but I—to respond to Your Honor's question about 5326 and the two prohibitions there, so you were, I believe, referencing the second prohibition, which is that IHS funds cannot be spent to pay costs associated with any contract that's not with IHS. We understand that prohibition to be limited to contracts by which the tribe receives funds, which is consistent with Congress's—what we understand to be Congress's motivation to not have IHS's appropriated funds be used to subsidize other funding schemes. But, even if you disagree with me about that, I would point you to the first prohibition in 5326. That is the one saying that IHS's appropriated funds cannot be used to spend on—to reimburse costs that are not directly attributable to ISDA contracts. And we think that that language squarely applies here because attributable is asking for a causation.\n\nJudge: The contract requires them to seek reimbursement. How can it not be attributable? As previously pointed out, before, they didn't have to do it. Now they're forced to do it by contract.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because we think attributable is calling for—I mean, the word means capable of being produced by or brought about by or caused by. And then you add directly, which is an adverb that doesn't appear the other times that ISDA—the three other times that ISDA uses the word \"attributable.\" And that is—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There's an extended—\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I—this is a complicated statute and so I have a question about how it actually works. It seems to me there's an argument that these costs should be included in the secretarial amount. Am I right that you don't dispute that the costs of collecting the Medicare and Medicaid fall within the secretarial amount?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. When IHS collects the money, does IHS then spend it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. It has to first dedicate it to the facility that earned its compliance with Medicaid and Medicare, but yes.\n\nJudge: Right. So, if the tribe is standing in IHS's shoes, why shouldn't the secretarial amount—I don't understand the tribes—and the plaintiff's counsel can address this point—I don't understand the tribes to be saying it should be part of the secretarial amount, but if the secretarial amount includes the costs of collection, it's not apparent to me why it wouldn't cover the costs of expenditure in the same way that you're saying IHS spends that money.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because the—well, there are some—I'm not sure this is Your Honor's question. There are some overhead administrative functions that are included in the secretarial amount if they're the kind of thing that the Secretary could have allocated to that tribe. But, no, the costs of spending income from third parties is not part of the secretarial amount because that is limited to the funds the Secretary otherwise would have provided for the operation of the program. And then the contract support cost obligation is itself tied as funds to support that amount.\n\nJudge: Except my confusion is you're saying that the secretarial amount does include the costs of collecting the third-party income, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, because—yeah.\n\nJudge: Yeah. And you incur overhead costs when you spend that third-party income as well, which I take to be the entire dispute here, is whether they get coverage for that, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, but I guess I would say the costs of collection and billing, that is associated with providing the services using the secretarial amount itself. These later costs of deciding how to spend those funds, which may not even happen during the same contract period, that is not tied up with the services being provided in the first instance. So the billing function, we think, comes over with the secretarial amount because it's tied up with providing the services and getting the funds in return but not with the later decisions about how to spend this money, which could be spent on building a new facility, starting a new kind of healthcare program the Secretary didn't previously run on the tribes' behalf, that kind of thing.\n\nJudge: I think the answer, though, if I understood it correctly, is that when IHS does collect third-party payments, it spends that money to advance Indian health, and that includes some overhead costs?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that is correct.\n\nJudge: And then—just back to where we were earlier, you said that the plaintiff's counsel didn't raise an argument. I've got page 27 of the brief in front of me. \"At a minimum, contract support costs are recoverable when program income is used to fund enumerated services within the contractual scope of work.\" And on page 29, they state that every penny of program income was, in fact, spent for activities enumerated in the contractual scope of work.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I don't understand that to be an argument along the lines Your Honor was suggesting about—\n\nJudge: Why not? My argument was—my question was, aren't they obliged under (m)(1) to spend on general purposes, that's Indian health, and aren't they also obligated to spend in accordance with the contractual services that they've agreed to provide for the government?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I—\n\nJudge: That is exactly what's laid out in those pages.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think they're distinguishing between serving eligible Indian beneficiaries and those that the tribe is eligible to serve once they make a determination that they can.\n\nJudge: How do you square that view and that interpretation with the rule of construction that the statute gives us, which says—I'm looking at 5321(g)—that each provision shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Indian tribe participating in self-determination?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because we believe that statutory language is calling for courts to apply the Indian canon, the common law Indian canon that has been applied in this Court's cases.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1012", "dialogue": "Judge\nJustice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer\nI want to pick up on what you were saying to the Chief Justice because -- and in some of the colloquy you were having earlier because I think there's an important distinction to be made between what an agency can do or maybe should do as a matter of good government and what the role of the courts is in reviewing what the agencies do. And we start with the deference on the arbitrary and capricious standard, but given the uncertain lines that were reflected in your answers to Justice Barrett and Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson about how far to go, it seems to me the deference of the courts has to be huge with respect to how the agencies think about the scope of what they're going to consider. And it seems to me the problem that has crept in is conflating what the agency can do and should do from what the role of the courts is here.\n\nAnd by the courts taking an overly aggressive role, it's in turn created an incentive for the agencies to -- to do 3,000-page EI -- you know, environmental impact statements.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nI think that's absolutely correct, and it's -- it's no coincidence that all the -- almost all of these -- this Court's cases about NEPA have been where a court has required the agency to do more than the agency concluded in its own judgment was necessary. And so I -- I think the -- the Court could accomplish a lot in terms of NEPA litigation by emphasizing the points that you just did against -- again, it's not manufactured -- this Court has said reasonableness is the -- you know, is the standard in measuring how far an agency should go.\n\nAnd who better than the agency in the first instance, say this is the decision that's before us, this is what I need or what I think I need to -- to consider that, to have considered environmental issues enough to go forward with a decision. One other point about the arbitrary and capricious.\n\nSometimes agencies treat the EIS as if it's agency action that they should independently review.\n\nThe ultimate question is whether the agency action should be set aside because of some defect in the EIS in the end. Analytically, the EIS is not its own agency action.\n\nIt's part of the record on which the agency is acting. So, if -- if the court finds some defect in some detail of the -- of the environmental impact statement, not only does that not render the whole EIS invalid, but it -- but you have to ask a further question, should we be setting aside the agency's decision on the basis of -- of something in a document? It's a very important document, but, again, it -- it shows in judicial review some attenuation between what the EIS does and what the agency's substantive decision is.\n\nJudge\nAnd just to underscore something that I think you're going to agree with, the new Act makes it impossible for the agency to -- to do the kind of detail that some courts have demanded.\n\nSo --\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nYeah, it does --\n\nJudge\n-- the deference, it's going to be like deference squared with the new Act, it seems to me, but --\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nWell, it does -- it does exempt appendices from that. (Laughter.)\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nI know.\n\nI -- you know, I --\n\nJudge\nYeah.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nYes.\n\nBut -- but I -- but I -- but I think it's like --\n\nJudge\nDon't try that here. (Laughter.)\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nI think it's like saying we'll get around -- get around the word limit by putting it in the -- but an agency has to be able to -- an agency has to be able to document technically some of its judgments.\n\nSo the E -- but I -- but I -- I do think that that would ease the task of judicial review because it necessarily will focus the -- the decision -- the decision in -- in readable, understandable forms and force the agency to give the -- to give its most important reasons.\n\nAnd a further detail for, you know, some hydrological studies and whatnot, that can be dealt with in the appendix. So I think it -- it can be a useful separation of the agency's explication of its reasons and what should -- what should be the primary focus of the court.\n\nJudge\nA last -- last quick thing.\n\nWhat do you think we should say about Sabal Trail?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nI think it's a close question, frankly.\n\nAnd we -- we -- the government argued that -- that FERC was not required to evaluate the emissions at the -- at the other end.\n\nThere is a difference between this case and -- and FERC pipelines because, in this case, once -- you know, the STB doesn't control where trains are going to go.\n\nThat's all left up to private decision-making. When you have a pipeline, FERC is authorizing the pipeline to take gas from here to here.\n\nAnd so, if you had -- if you had the power plant right, you know, at the end of the pipeline, it would be sort of hard to say that -- that that's not a -- a indirect effect at least of -- of the pipeline. But we are very concerned, as Mr. Clement is, once you start expanding that to -- in -- in Sabal Trail, there were five refineries it could go to.\n\nAnd so the courts tend to look at that as a factual question.\n\nIf you could figure out where it's actually going to go, you should investigate it.\n\nI don't think that's the right way to look at it or not -- not the full way to look at it --\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\n-- because legal responsibility, they're not responsible for which particular refinery it's --\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\n-- it's going to go to.\n\nJudge\nJustice Barrett?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nJust one quick follow-up on that because that was my question too about Sabal Trail.\n\nYou know, Mr. Clement said, well, at least what Sabal Trail has come to stand for. And would the government agree that even if Sabal Trail itself was correct for some of the reasons that you say, that what courts have interpreted Sabal Trail to mean is too aggressive?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nYes.\n\nNo, that -- and that's -- that's what I was -- was trying to convey because that gets you into thing -- that gets you into speculation.\n\nIt gets you into other agency responsible.\n\nIt gets you into individual decision-makers and -- and all that.\n\nJudge\nJustice Jackson?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nYes.\n\nSo I'm reflecting on your conversation with Justices Kagan and Barrett, and maybe I don't understand how Mr. Clement's test works, but I thought that each element operated independently to narrow the circumstances in which further study would be required. So right next door but within the regulatory jurisdiction of another agency, I thought, would not pass Mr. Clement's test because he had a separate element about it has to be in your own jurisdiction.

Let's say I agree with you that if you're talking about content manipulation, that's an inherently content-based rationale for acting.\r\n\r\nSo, if Congress had passed a law that says we hate the content manipulation that TikTok is doing, that's strict scrutiny land, and I don't know that the government can do that, however important the interest.\r\n\r\nBut that's not what Congress is doing here -- and this is the same kinds of questions that I asked --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\n-- Mr. Francisco -- because, if --if -- let's take it as a given that Congress actually can do whatever it wants with respect to a wholly foreign corporation or a foreign government.\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\nAnd so Congress could act with the intent to interfere with the content manipulation that a foreign corporation is doing.\r\n\r\nAnd so now we're in this strange world where we're saying they can't act with respect to TikTok.\r\n\r\nThey could act with respect to ByteDance.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't this Congress acting with respect to ByteDance in the sense that all it's doing is saying ByteDance has to divest, and then TikTok can go about its business, use whatever algorithm it wants, use whatever content-moderation policies it wants, just like everybody else does, choosing from everything that's available on the open market?\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nSo let me answer that question in two parts from the perspective of the creator Americans who want to use this platform to speak to other Americans.\r\n\r\nSo the first thing is what the Act does, as you said, is prevent us from working with an application that is owned by ByteDance that uses this algorithm.\r\n\r\nWell, that's exactly what we want to do.\r\n\r\nThat's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\nYeah, but what I'm saying to you is, if you just assume a world without TikTok, that --where it's only ByteDance --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\n-- and you were trying to --you were trying to say, well, we really want to work with ByteDance --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\n-- and Congress was saying we think ByteDance presents national security interests and they don't have First Amendment rights, they're just a foreign corporation, I think that in that case, the government -- I mean, tell me if you think this is wrong.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't matter --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\n-- that you have creators who want to work with ByteDance because ByteDance is a foreign corporation with no First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nIs that what you're contesting?\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nSo that is what I'm contesting.\r\n\r\nSo you said two things, though.\r\n\r\nSo I could be clear, there's two aspects.\r\n\r\nDo we have a First Amendment right to work with a foreign company or even a foreign country to publish our speech? And then there's a national security part that you put into that, which goes to the justification.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\nForget that.\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nForget that.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nLet's do that.\r\n\r\nSo, if that is right, then American creators have no right to make documentaries with the BBC.\r\n\r\nThey can't work with Al Jazeera if Congress wants to prevent that.\r\n\r\nAny number of other publications that are state-owned wholly or partially.\r\n\r\nAnd even under Lamont, remember, where you're not even creating speech, you're just listening, you know, that was speech from China that the Court said you have a First Amendment right to receive.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\nSo would I be right to say that your position is that because of the users who want to associate and want to partner with this foreign corporation, the foreign corporation ends up having, in your view, the exact same First Amendment rights as your users do? In other words, it's irrelevant --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\n-- that the foreign corporation doesn't have First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nI don't think it's irrelevant because you could imagine a situation where no American distributor or speaker wants to work with that.\r\n\r\nBut let me put it to you this way: The Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx has no First Amendment standing on its own in America, but if a bookstore wants to sell that publication, I don't think Congress can prevent it from doing so.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nA --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nOh, sorry.\r\n\r\nGo ahead.\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nNo, I'm -- I'm fine.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nNo, no, no.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer\r\nI'm good.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nSo I want to --but I want to press you a little bit on the distinction because, in Lamont, the prohibition worked directly on the American, like you have to specifically request this information that comes.\r\n\r\nThis is working -- kind of as Justice Kagan's questions were pressing you, this is working on ByteDance.\r\n\r\nIt's not saying to your creators you can't post on ByteDance. That's indirectly going to happen --\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- if ByteDance chooses itself not to permit TikTok to walk away with the code.\r\n\r\nSo does that matter, that distinction between Lamont and this case?\r\n\r\nDefendant Lawyer\r\nNo, for two reasons. One, under the Sorrell case, you look to not just the law itself but its practical operation.\r\n\r\nAnd the practical operation does prevent us from working with ByteDance.\r\n\r\nSo that's one answer.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1038", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Alito mentioned the Reich case as well, and that's another one where it was a forged court order that prompted the litigant to dismiss a mandamus petition, but that didn't have anything to do with the evidence that was going to be considered in that proceeding.\nJudge: So what role does (c)(1) play in your analysis?\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we understand 1512(c) to split up the world of obstructive conduct of an official proceeding into the (c)(1) offense and into (c)(2). (c)(1) covers everything it enumerates. It's the acts of altering, concealing, destroying records, documents, or other objects. And then (c)(2) would only pick up conduct that obstructs an official proceeding in a different way. So there's no duplication or superfluity on our reading. Instead, Congress was taking this universe and dividing it up into the two separate offenses. And I think that's actually a virtue of our reading as compared to Petitioner's because I have not heard him articulate anything that would fall within (c)(1) that wouldn't also come within (c)(2). So, on his reading, (c)(2) really does just swallow (c)(1) whole.\nJudge: Well, I mean, in the way you're reading it, (c)(1) -- (c)(2) almost exists in isolation, certainly not affected by (c)(1).\nDefendant's Lawyer: We don't deny at all that there is a relationship between the two provisions, Justice Thomas, but it's --\nJudge: What is that relationship?\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the relationship is the one Congress specified in the text. It's what follows the word \"otherwise.\" That is the relevant degree of similarity. What both (c)(1) and (c)(2) have in common is that they -- they aim at conduct that obstructs an official proceeding. (c)(1) does so in one way, tampering with records and documents; (c)(2) does so with respect to all other conduct that in a different manner does that. And I think that this has to be the road the Court goes down to look at what Congress actually prescribed with respect to similarity because, in contrast, if you take up Petitioner's invitation to come up with some atextual gloss from (c)(1) to port over into (c)(2), I don't understand what the Court could look at to guide its determination of exactly what the relevant similarity would be.\nJudge: General, I'm sure you've had a chance to read our opinion released Friday in the Bissonnette case. It was unanimous. It was very short.\nJudge: But it explained how to apply the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and it -- what it said is you had specific terms, a more general catchall, if you will, term at the end, and it said that the general phrase is controlled and defined by reference to the terms that precede it. The \"otherwise\" phrase is more general, and the terms that precede it are \"alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record and document.\" And applying the doctrine as was set forth in that opinion, the specific terms \"alters, destroy, and mutilate\" carry forward into (2), and the terms \"record, document, or other object\" carry -- carry forward into (2) as well. And it seems to me that they, as I said, sort of control and define the -- the more general term.\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the statute --\nJudge: And I'm sorry. Just to interrupt --\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh, yes.\nJudge: --so I could put out exactly what -- and -- and the \"otherwise\" means in other ways. It alters, destroys, and mutilates record, document, or other objects that impede the investigation and otherwise, in other ways, accomplishes the same result.\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the problem with that approach with respect to 1512 is that it doesn't look like the typical kind of statutory phrase that consists of a parallel list of nouns or a parallel list of verbs where the Court has applied ejusdem generis or the noscitur canon. You know, these are separate prohibitions that have their own complex, non-parallel internal structure. And I think, actually, the best evidence that it's hard to figure out how you would divine a degree of similarity between them just based on the word \"otherwise\" is that there are multiple competing interpretations at issue in this case. You know, Justice Alito touched on them, and they're reflected in the competing interpretations between Judge Katsas on the D.C. Circuit and Judge Nichols on the district court.\nJudge: Competing interpretations of what, which phrase?\nDefendant's Lawyer: So --and it relates to exactly the -- the question you asked me, which is that Judge Nichols thought that (c)(1) should limit (c)(2), and he looked at it and said, well, the relevant thing about (c)(1) is it deals with records, documents, and other objects, and so that means (c)(2) should be limited only to other acts that impair physical evidence. Meanwhile, Judge Katsas looked at the specific intent requirement in (c)(1), to take action that impairs the availability or use of the evidence, and he divined a broader gloss to put on (c)(2) and said --\nJudge: Well, but that's simply saying --\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- it should be other impairment of all other evidence.\nJudge: Well, they're just applying the same doctrine to different aspects of it. And I think you do that as -- as well. What are the common elements? Alters, destroy, and mutilates a record or document. You have the first few, what you're doing, and what you're doing it to. And you -- and you apply both of those in -- as it said in Bissonnette, controlling and defining the term that follows so that it should involve something that's capable of alteration, destruction, and mutilation and with respect to a record or a document. That -- that's how you -- that's why --\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I actually don't even understand --\nJudge: -- when you -- when you apply that doctrine, again, as we did on Friday, it -- it responds to some of the concerns that have been raised about how broad (c)(2) is. You can't just tack it on and say look at it as if it's standing alone because it's not.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "344", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I go back to Q? Because I was—I don't know why it's incongruous or why it suggests a problem. I went back and researched the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. At least three—I didn't canvass the universe—include a criminal provision that applies to the United States that's nearly identical to this one. It says imprisonment and/or fine.\n\nSo I don't know why copying what has been used in other acts for which there's no question that there's a waiver of sovereign immunity, why the fact that they refer to imprisonment or—and fine means that somehow sovereign immunity wasn't waived.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—\n\nJudge: It's a common provision written exactly like this one is, and in those acts, we've never said their existence calls into question the waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I—I’m not sure, are you referring to criminal provisions in those other statutes?\n\nJudge: Yes, yes.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I—I think the significant thing about the criminal provisions elsewhere in the— the Code, my friend has pointed to just one, that when Congress has wanted to accomplish that really unusual result, it has been just crystal-clear that that's—\n\nJudge: No. That's what I'm saying to you. Read the—the best example is the Clean Air Act. It's virtually identical to this one. It basically says any person who violates the Act—and there's no doubt that the person is the government—is subject to imprisonment or a fine.\n\nSo it's written identically to this provision. So, if I have that as text and I see it in other statutes, I don't know why reading it here would be incongruous to me or suggest that somehow Congress didn't intend \"person\" to mean exactly what it means.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—so, even the court of appeals recognized—\n\nJudge: Well, it may—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —I mean, you did not recognize it—\n\nJudge: —it may have recognized it, but what I'm saying to you is I don't.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So accepting that, let me—let me maybe turn wisely to other—other points of our argument.\n(Laughter.)\n\n1681u[j], which is the provision where Congress really did want to authorize civil actions against the federal agencies—\n\nJudge: Is that the FBI one?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's the FBI one. And it refers explicitly to the FBI. Again, I'm not going to suggest—\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —that that's absolutely—\n\nJudge: —yeah, that one is also difficult for me because that provision is an exemption from the Act, basically permitting the FBI to do things and consumer agencies to do things that otherwise might violate the statute, and it's now saying, okay, we've given you an exemption, but we're going to keep you liable if you step outside the terms of this exemption, and it sets forth the terms of that liability.\n\nI don't know why that is the same thing—why that's illogical or suggests incongruity with a waiver of sovereign immunity for other violations of the Act.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, the only—the only point we're making about that provision is that when we—we know that Congress wanted to address civil liability of federal agencies, it said so expressly.\n\nJudge 2: Mr. Lawyer—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And that's—\n\nJudge 2: I'm sorry, finish your answer.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: My answer is going to have three more parts.\n\nJudge 2: Sure.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—\n\nJudge 2: Go ahead. (Laughter.) I'll wait.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —if you want to jump in, but the—the—\n\nJudge 2: I'll wait.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —the—the next thing that I'd point to is that reading 1681n and o to use the Act-wide definition would render those provisions plainly unconstitutional as applied to unconsenting states under this Court's decision—\n\nJudge: Well, that's all right. We had the same problem in the Kimel case, and in the Kimel case, we had three layers of reference to the waiver of sovereign immunity, and we didn't require magic words. We just figured out what the definition was, even though it referred to another statute and the other statute referred to a different provision. And yet, no magic words were required.\n\nAnd in Kimel, we had exactly the same thing. The government argued that it was incongruous to permit suits against the state because the states hadn't waived their sovereign immunity. But that's a different constitutional provision.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, in Kimel, there was language in the cause of action itself that was there only for the purpose of authorizing suits—\n\nJudge: Well, assuming we buy your first argument that any person who is negligent doesn't mean the sovereign, if it's negligent, is responsible. We have to take that first step, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So that—just to be clear, that's not our first argument. Our first argument is that even if you think the cause of action covers both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, as this Court recognized in Employees, the—the question of whether the government—or the Congress has lifted the sovereign immunity defense is analytically distinct from it. So—\n\nJudge: It is analytically distinct. It can't lift state sovereignty. So it can't do it here either.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, in Employees, the Court assumed that Congress would be able to lift sovereign immunity. That was—that was before '75.\n\nJudge: Well, that was Employees is an old case, 1973, analyzed in a very different way with a lot of different issues.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, respectfully, I disagree with that. I mean, I think this idea that Employees and Parden are sort of of a piece in the bad old days, I just don't think that's a plausible description of those cases. So, if you—\n\nJudge: We'll let the other side answer that. I don't want to monopolize you. So—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Just briefly on that, I mean, in College Savings Bank, the opinion for the Court by Justice Scalia said—points out that Employees was written by one of the Parden dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parden's author and that it began the Court's retreat from Parden. So I think Employees is entirely consistent with this Court's modern approach to sovereign immunity.\n\nThe—the other two parts of the answer that I promised Judge 2 I was going to get out, we would—we think it's significant that the 1996 amendments occurred just months after Seminole Tribe. The idea that Congress adopted this plainly unconstitutional statute without saying anything at all in the statute itself or the legislative history we don't think is plausible.\n\nWe also think it's significant that these were adopted at different points in time, so you don't have Congress adopting a cause of action applicable to persons and then saying at the same time that for those purposes, we want this— \"persons\" to include the United States.\n\nAnd then, finally, we think there are a number of other statutes where, as with FCRA, Congress has defined \"person\" to include the United States, but then, in the causes of action, when it's wanted to authorize recovery against the United States, it hasn't just relied on that general definition of \"person.\" It has said in RCRA, for example, that suit is authorized against any person, comma, including the United States.\n\nAnd, Judge 3, to go back to where we started with why that is different from a case where Congress has just—I realize I've—I skipped over Judge 2, but—\n\nJudge 2: That's okay.

What is the test for determining that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nI mean, I think it will --it will turn a lot on the claim.\r\n\r\nLet me try to describe what I think is going on here, which is that before this policy was put into place, the City was treating three groups of people as equally deserving of the subsidy, so people who had completed 25 years of service, people who had completed a combined year -- 25 years of service when taking into account military service and other firefighting positions, and then people who retired with -- with a disability.\r\n\r\nThat's the third category.\r\n\r\nAnd when faced with a budget shortfall, the City chose to only exclude that third group, people with disabilities, from the subsidy despite the absence of any evidence that it would ameliorate the shortfall.\r\n\r\nSo the City singled out people with disabilities solely because of their disabilities.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, we know that the City has told a disabled retiree who did have 25 years of service that he still could not have the subsidy because he had, after 25 years, become disabled.\r\n\r\nSo what -- what we would, I think, want the opportunity to do on remand is to show that the City treated Lieutenant Stanley differently because of her disability.\r\n\r\nIf she weren't disabled, she would have made it to 25 years and gotten the subsidy.\r\n\r\nAnd if the City didn't single out disabled people, she would have gotten the subsidy.\r\n\r\nOf course, the City will have the opportunity on remand to show why we're wrong and -- in their view.\r\n\r\nAnd whether you think the underlying claim is doomed to fail or destined to succeed, the -- the question presented is the same.\r\n\r\nAnd I do think these are difficult claims to succeed on.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell, you've said -- you've said a lot.\r\n\r\nAnd I -- I -- I'm not asking -- I -- I -- I'm not talking about the validity of this particular claim.\r\n\r\nI just don't know how this is going to be approached.\r\n\r\nWhen you have -- you have structured retirement benefits, distinctions are going to be made.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nSo part of what you said seems to me -- seems to be that the City just had irrational bias against people with a disability, okay? That would be one -- one argument that might be made.\r\n\r\nAnother part of what you seem to have said is that they didn't really have a -- an economy -- a valid economy rationale.\r\n\r\nBy not extending the benefits to people who retire with disability, they really weren't going to save any money.\r\n\r\nBut suppose there's no evidence of -- of bias and, presumably, they will save some money and they say, look, we need to cut -- we needed to cut back, so we cut -- this is where we cut back and we have a reason for it.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that we want to reward people who work for us for 25 years.\r\n\r\nHow -- how is a court going to approach this kind of issue?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nWell --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nBecause, if you take out the reasonable accommodation question, I just don't know how this is going to be -- how it's going to be approached by courts in the future.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nWell, Judge, you mentioned, you know, a structured benefit plan and the ability to make sort of actuarial sorts of decisions.\r\n\r\nAnd Congress actually did focus on this precise problem when it drafted the ADA, and it included a safe harbor provision.\r\n\r\nThat's Section 12201(c).\r\n\r\nAnd that immunizes plan sponsors, plan administrators, insurance companies, from these kinds of risk-based decisions.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, your opinion in the Ford case, your concurring opinion in one of these decisions comprising the circuit split, mentioned that safe harbor.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that actually, to the extent that the amici on the other side are hypothesizing a flood of claims, the reason you haven't seen that in the Second and Third Circuits is because that safe harbor provision takes care of and immunizes defendants from -- from the large, you know, majority of those kinds of claims.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nAll right.\r\n\r\nThank you. That's helpful.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nJustice Sotomayor?\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThe other side argues that the ADA is only about bringing workers into the workforce and keeping them there.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that part of the ADA's goal is to encourage people with disability to go into the workforce, and that includes how much benefits they're going to get, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nExactly, yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nAnd -- and to the extent that people with disabilities, whether before they enter the workforce or they retire, if the health insurance plan or the benefit they thought they had isn't there, or they're afraid it won't be there, that will be -- disincentivize them from going into the workforce, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nAll right.\r\n\r\nNow the other side argues that there are a whole plethora of remedies besides this one, besides the ADA, to vindicate retirees' rights.\r\n\r\nCould you go through them --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- and tell me why you think they're not -- besides the fact that the ADA has different -- different damages scope, I'm not sure that they would qualify, that retirees would qualify for many of these alternatives that they raise.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nI think that's right.\r\n\r\nI mean, the other sources of law are not a substitute, and, certainly, they're not trained directly on discrimination on the basis of disability.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

In your petition, you made a sweeping statement, which I will quote: \"Overwhelming evidence establishes that the appropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty blockers and hormones directly and substantially improves the physical, psychological well-being of transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\" That was in November 2023.\n\nNow, even before then, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare wrote the following: They currently assess \"that the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of these treatments,\" which is directly contrary to the sweeping statement in your petition. After the filing of your petition, of course, we saw the -- the release of the Cass report in the United Kingdom, which found a complete lack of high-quality evidence showing that the benefits of the treatments in question here outweigh the risks.\n\nAnd so I wonder if you would like to stand by the statement that you made in your petition or if you think it would now be appropriate to modify that and withdraw the statement that there is overwhelming evidence establishing that these treatments have benefits that greatly outweigh the risks and the dangers.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI, of course, acknowledge, Justice, that there is a lot of debate happening here and abroad about the proper model of delivery of this care and exactly when adolescents should receive it and how to identify the adolescents for whom it would be helpful.\n\nBut I stand by that there is a consensus that these treatments can be medically necessary for some adolescents, and that's true no matter what source you look at.\n\nYou mentioned both the Cass report and Sweden --\n\nJudge:\nWell, can be --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- but neither of those jurisdictions --\n\nJudge:\n-- can be medically necessary for some minors.\n\nBut, for the general run of minors, do you dispute the proposition, in fact, that in almost all instances, the judgment at the present time of the health authorities in the United Kingdom and Sweden is that the risks and dangers greatly outweigh the benefits?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI --\n\nJudge:\nDo you dispute that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- I do dispute that because, if you actually look at how those jurisdictions are addressing this issue, they have not outright banned this care.\n\nThe Cass report says at multiple points that this care can be medically indicated for some transgender adolescents.\n\nAnd, of course, it's true that they have called for a more individualized approach to these issues and have questioned whether it should be readily applied to all adolescents as a matter of course.\n\nJudge:\nIs it not --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nBut what that supports --\n\nJudge:\n-- is it not true that in England -- I -- I'm sorry to interrupt --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\n-- but I -- time is running out -- that the National Health Service some months ago limited the prescription of puberty blockers to adolescent males who are over the age of 16 and are already on estrogen, but, for those who are under the age of 16, it's allowed only for experimental purposes? Is that not true?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo the approach in the U.K. right now is to allow hormone therapy for anyone 16 and older, and, with respect to puberty blockers, the U.K. has restricted new prescriptions outside of research settings.\n\nBut the Cass implementation plan itself makes clear that if a medical team determines that these medications are necessary for a particular patient, they will be provided.\n\nAnd that is a --\n\nJudge:\nThe restriction that I mentioned was imposed by the British government some months ago.\n\nIt was reaffirmed by the current Labour government, was it not? It was upheld by the High Court of Justice as based on sufficient medical evidence.\n\nIsn't all of that true?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI believe that all of that's true.\n\nIt's outside the record in this case, and so I -- I haven't myself confirmed everything that you just cited, which wasn't before the district court in this case.\n\nBut let me make a couple of additional points.\n\nTo the extent that you think that this needs to be taken into account in the application of heightened scrutiny, there's a time and a place for that, and it's with record evidence on remand.\n\nWe think the Court here just needs to recognize the sex-based classification in this statute and send the case back.\n\nIf the Court wants to go ahead and look at what's happening in Europe, the U.K. has not categorically banned this care.\n\nSweden, Finland, and Norway, the other jurisdictions that my friends point to, have not banned this care, and I think that's because of the recognition that this care can provide critical, sometimes life-saving, benefits for individuals with severe gender dysphoria.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nJustice Thomas, anything further? Justice?\n\nJudge:\nIn your opening brief, you did not mention any of these European developments.\n\nAnd in your reply brief, is it true -- is it not true that you just relegated the Cass report to a footnote?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo, Justice, with respect to the developments, there has been no change in the law that I'm aware of in Sweden, Finland, and Norway.\n\nEach of the medical authorities in those states has called for an individualized approach to care.\n\nThey've said it shouldn't be routinely applied.\n\nBut they have not changed their laws to do anything like what Tennessee is doing here, which is to categorically ban it no matter the need.\n\nWith respect to the Cass report, that isn't in the record in this case, but we have discussed that report in our reply brief, and, as I just noted, it likewise recognizes the need for this care on -- in individual cases.\n\nThe U.K. has not banned the care, and -- and Hilary Cass was not calling for such a ban.\n\nJudge:\nYour primary argument in the -- in your oral presentation this morning is based on Bostock-like reasoning, is that not correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think that's incorrect.\n\nOur primary argument is that this statute on its face says you can't have medications inconsistent with sex.\n\nAnd no matter what you think about transgender discrimination generally, that's a sex-based line.\n\nIt's no different than saying you can't dress inconsistent with your sex.\n\nMy friends concede on page 25 of their brief that's obviously a facial sex classification.\n\nBut our primary argument is SB1 is worded exactly the same way and it works exactly the same way.\n\nJudge:\nWell, you have a Bostock-like argument, and you say that a -- a girl who wants to live like a boy cannot be administered testosterone, but a boy who wants to live like a boy can be administered testosterone.\n\nSo -- and that -- and that's one of your major arguments.\n\nI take that to be a -- a Bostock-like argument. So my question is: Why should we look to Bostock here? Bostock involved the interpretation of particular language in a particular statute.\n\nAnd this is not a question of statutory interpretation.\n\nIt's a question of the application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court has addressed the -- the question of how an equal protection claim should be analyzed when the law in question treats a medical condition or procedure differently based on a characteristic that is associated with just one sex.\n\nAnd that was Geduldig in 1974, reaffirmed in Dobbs in 2022.\n\nAnd neither Bostock nor Dobbs saw any connection between the Bostock reasoning and the Geduldig/Dobbs standard.\n\nBostock did not mention Geduldig, and Dobbs did not mention Bostock.\n\nSo why should we -- we look to this Bostock-type reasoning here?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "836", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 22-807, Alexander versus the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: District 1 is not a racial gerrymander. Rather, the General Assembly largely preserved District 1 from the constitutional benchmark plan and made changes based on traditional criteria and politics. The panel acknowledged that the General Assembly pursued a political goal of increasing District 1's Republican vote share. It achieved that goal by moving Republicans into the district and Democrats out of the district. All of the direct evidence confirms that it used political data, not racial data, to identify Republicans and Democrats. The panel declared District 1 a racial gerrymander only by departing from this Court's precedents and adopting sua sponte an erroneous racial target theory.\nJudge: Mr. Gore, we review this for clear error. And the district court credited the plaintiffs' expert and found your experts non-credible. So how does that meet the clear error standard?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Court will proceed to clear error if it rejects our legal arguments, but let me turn to Dr. Ragusa first. All three of Dr. Ragusa's opinions raised in this appeal contradict his own data and conclusions in his initial report, which actually demonstrated that race did not predominate in the enacted plan's changes to District 1. His own data showed that politics was a stronger predictor than race of whether a VTD was moved out of District 1. He also concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between race and whether VTDs were moved into District 1.\nJudge: Well, I thought -- I thought he said that as far as geographic contiguity, that the -- the size of the different districts was an adequate proxy for that.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: He did say that traditional principles were embedded in his analysis, but whatever he meant by that, he did also admit on cross-examination that he didn't test or control for those principles and whether they explained the decisions the General Assembly actually made. That's the same error that the experts made in Allen that this Court set aside just last term. His failure to consider the location of VTDs and voters within the district is the same error that was committed by the expert in Cromartie II, where this Court reversed a finding of racial gerrymandering under the clear error standard.\nJudge: Did your expert present an alternative study which did control for geography and reached a different result?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: He did not try to mirror Dr. Ragusa's study --\nJudge: Because that would have been the easiest way to undermine the theory. I mean, as I understand it, this was hardly touched upon by -- by -- by the state below. And, certainly, the state did not do what would seem to be the normal thing if you were really concerned about this, which is to say: Look at our study. We controlled for geography. The results are entirely different.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We did raise objections to Dr. Ragusa's methodology, and as I was explaining, it is a flawed methodology and not reliable. Moreover, the state presented direct testimony from the map drawer to explain which VTDs were chosen and why. That direct evidence showed, like all the other direct evidence, that decisions were made based on politics and traditional principles and not using race at all.\nJudge: I think you end up in a very poor starting point under clear error arguing the substance of believability of one expert over another, because credibility findings under clear error standard must be deferred to to the district court. I understand your points about -- your point about Dr. Ragusa, but I just point out that other experts before the court and he himself said that geography was very much embedded as part of the structure of his analysis. You may disagree with that. It's going to be very hard for you to show that no fact finder could credit that understanding of his testimony. But I think what I'm really troubled by is, going back to Justice Thomas's question, what's the legal error and what's the clear error? Just tick them off for me.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: There are several legal errors, Justice Sotomayor.\nJudge: Not facts. I want legal errors or clear errors beyond -- under our standard.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The first legal error is a failure to enforce the alternative map requirement.\nJudge: Okay. I'm going to butt in. And I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.\nJudge: The alternative map requirement, I mean, doesn't exist. You know, sometimes this Court, I think, holds things, and then I go back to the opinion and I think: Well, maybe we weren't as clear as we might have been. Not here. I'm just going to read from -- from Cooper: A plaintiff's task is simply to persuade the trial court, without any special evidentiary prerequisite, that race, not politics, was the predominant consideration. In no area of our equal protection law have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form of proof to prevail, nor would it make sense to do so here. An alternative map is merely an evidentiary tool. Neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim. I don't know how to more clearly say that there is no alternative map requirement in these kinds of cases.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Cooper was directed -- was addressing a case where there was direct evidence of racial predominance. It also said on page 322 in the majority opinion: In a case like Cromartie II -- that is, one in which the plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerrymander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alternatives -- only maps of that kind could carry the day.\nJudge: All we were saying there, Mr. Gore, is that in a case with no other evidence, you needed some evidence. So that is not this case. Cromartie II was making a very case-specific point, look at this case, there's none -- none of this kind of evidence, there's none of that kind of evidence, there's none of the other kind of evidence. So, my gosh, in that case, you needed a map. But this is case by case, all we were saying is that when you have no other evidence, you better present a map. But that's not to say that there's anything like an alternative map requirement. If you make your case some other way, that's good enough. And, here, the Court found, again, on a clear error standard, that the plaintiffs made their case some other way.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But even if that's the correct reading of Cooper, Justice Kagan, there were still other legal errors in how the panel conducted its analysis.\nJudge: Well, Mr. Gore --\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: One --\nJudge: -- I thought your argument was that at least as a practical matter, in a case in which there is no direct evidence or virtually no direct evidence, there is no way in which a plaintiff can disentangle race and politics, except by providing an alternative map. I thought that was your legal argument.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That is.\nJudge: And that's exactly what Cooper says is not the case.\nJudge: Well, one may read Cooper a different way. Cooper was a case in which there was a lot of direct evidence, was there not?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\nJudge: Well, let me ask you, how could there be direct evidence really in this kind of case? So this is what I'm a little concerned about because, to the extent that this distinction's turning on whether or not there is direct evidence, I wonder if it is reasonable to require such evidence or -- or say that such evidence would exist in a situation that is not a majority/majority -- a majority/minority district scenario. You can see how there would be direct evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to make a majority/minority district, so we're going to have some evidence of people saying that. But, in a situation like this, where that is not the case, where the state is saying instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand -- and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to prove just on its own. Are you asking that we have the smoking gun in a situation like this?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Not at all, Justice Jackson. As you pointed out, of course, in majority/minority district contexts, there's often direct evidence of a use of race and even of race predominating. You could also have that in another context if the map-drawer or some key legislator admitted to using race as a proxy for politics because they didn't have adequate election data or --\nJudge: But are you requiring that? Could we ever -- could we ever make this showing on circumstantial evidence alone? There were some amicus briefs related to computer drawings and that sort of thing that they thought would be particularly helpful in this context.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The -- the alternative map itself would perform that requirement because, if race predominated over politics, then any alternative map can be drawn that preserves the political outcome the General Assembly was seeking while removing the alleged racial effect.\nJudge: Putting that aside, there were alternative maps here that showed that if race wasn't used, the map would not look like this. So it didn't show what you're saying. But we go back, let's assume, let's move back past the map because I think Cooper was petulantly clear that you don't need a smoking gun, and if you don't need a smoking gun, you don't need direct evidence. What are the other legal errors?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Another legal error was the panel's misconstruction of the Sell -- Shelby County decision. It also failed to disentangle race and politics, as this Court has directed it to do. It ignored volumes of direct evidence on the politics-versus-race question. It didn't even --\nJudge: It didn't --\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- discuss that evidence --\nJudge: -- it -- it --\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- in its opinion.\nJudge: -- it rejected -- the person who drew it was Mr. Roberts? Mr. -- and it disclaimed his credibility. So whatever the legislature said in terms of their intent is irrelevant. It's what he did, and the Court did not believe that he didn't use race. It said so.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Court did not accept his version of events but didn't make a credibility finding based on his demeanor or testimony at trial. It simply credited other evidence. But, in conducting the sensitive inquiry that Cooper requires, the Court was required to look at all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, of intent, and it simply didn't do that here. Senator Campsen testified --\nJudge: That's the legal error, is that they didn't correctly weigh the evidence?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They didn't correctly conduct the inquiry.\nJudge: Because that sounds like a factual error to me. I mean, your brief basically, you know, says we have legal errors, and then it says, well, the evidence didn't show. Those are factual errors. That's subject to the clear error standard, going back to Justice Thomas's question.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "516", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?\r\n\r\nJudge: So, Mr. Katyal, I -- I am worried about what I see as the delta between what you're asking for here today and what you asked for in your petition and what you argued in your brief, and I'm trying to reconcile the two. So I just heard you say to Justice Kavanaugh that particularity requires answering what the CEO knew and when did he know it.\r\n\r\nThat's the rule that you want us to put forward?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Those are the most important aspects, again, in a case in which it's based on those types of allegations.\r\n\r\nYou can have other cases, but --\r\n\r\nJudge: Right, right, right.\r\n\r\nSo -- okay.\r\n\r\nAnd then I think, in order to reconcile that with what you have already said in your briefing, you would have to say and the only way to do that in any case of that nature is to allege the contents of the documents, because I don't know that you can get away from having said over and over again, including in your question presented, that the allegation of the contents of the documents is important.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\r\n\r\nSo you've got to have the details of the documents.\r\n\r\nJudge: So --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: And that includes, you know, what did -- when I say what did the CEO know --\r\n\r\nJudge: Right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- the way to answer that is what are the contents of that.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to have the document itself.\r\n\r\nJudge: No, I understand that. But I --you don't need to append the document to your complaint.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: But you have to allege the contents.\r\n\r\nI mean, so --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- your answer to Justice Kagan's hypotheticals, I think, would come out differently because she did not in her hypotheticals talk about allegations that spoke of the content of the documents.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Oh, yes, she did.\r\n\r\nSo -- so, remember, her hypothetical as I understood it was a CEO gets documents saying our sales are really low and then goes out publicly and says our sales are very high.\r\n\r\nJudge: That was hypo one.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: That shows the delta.\r\n\r\nJudge: And then she -- then she -- then she -- didn't she migrate from that to say --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: And it still had --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- that the employees say these kinds of documents are circulated, we know the CEO looks at these kinds of documents, and his statements were different?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: And if, you know -- and if there's details about the documents, then, yes, that meets the particularity requirement.\r\n\r\nJudge: So they -- so you have to have the contents of the documents?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: You have to have the contents or something like the Stevelman case, in which you can infer by the CEO's conduct, like if they go and sell their stock personally or something like that, we know there's a very strong inference as to what the documents say.\r\n\r\nJudge: I know.\r\n\r\nBut your argument doesn't have the \"or\" in it.\r\n\r\nYour argument says: \"Where, as here\" --and I'm reading from the summary of argument --\"a plaintiff seeks to establish scienter by relying on allegations that internal company documents contradicted public statements, the plaintiff must allege the contents of those documents.\"\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: \"Otherwise, the allegations are insufficiently particularized because they do not describe what the documents said.\"\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: So I was led to believe from that kind of language that really, your rule is you have to allege --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: We think that's --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- what the documents say.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\r\n\r\nWe think that's basically right because that's based on what those documents are.\r\n\r\nSo, if the allegation is, you know, these documents say X, then you've got to have details --\r\n\r\nJudge: And if we disagree with that, you lose, right? Because that's the rule you're asking for.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: No, I don't think we lose.\r\n\r\nI mean, it depends on exactly how -- what you disagreed, but if you said, for example, the timing really matters, as it does here, you know, that when question, they lose every day of the week because they can't show any allegations during the class period.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gupta.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The PSLRA demands particularity.\r\n\r\nEveryone agrees you can't circumvent the statute with conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated expert opinions.\r\n\r\nBut that's not what happened here. On falsity, the court of appeals' holding expressly rested on a combination of facts showing that a substantial part of gaming revenues came from crypto.\r\n\r\nThat mix included former employees' detailed accounts of internal data and meetings, the very similar analysis of the Royal Bank of Canada and Prysm, and Huang's eventual acknowledgment of the crypto hangover, which sent the stock tumbling 28 percent. On scienter too, the court of appeals relied on a mix of facts.\r\n\r\nExecutives with direct knowledge of Huang's knowledge attested that the internal data showed 60 to 70 percent of gaming revenues came from crypto, that other internal data corroborated this, and that Huang personally reviewed that data every Sunday. The Court also relied on Huang's public representations about his own knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen analysts repeatedly asked him if crypto was driving gaming sales, he called this wrong, claiming that crypto's effect was \"small but not zero.\" He didn't express uncertainty.\r\n\r\nHe said: We know the market's every move, we are masters at managing our own channel.

{"id": "1013", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Robinson, this Court held that the government cannot criminalize status. And Respondent has conceded here today that the City cannot criminalize the status of being homeless. Our narrow submission in this case is that government cannot circumvent the principle of Robinson by making it unlawful for a person to reside in the jurisdiction if he has that status. That is what the ordinances here do. As applied to someone who has nowhere else to sleep, which is an essential human function, the ordinances are the equivalent of making it a crime to be homeless while living in Grants Pass.\n\nAlthough we think the lower court was right to recognize that the core principle of Robinson is implicated in this case, the Court was wrong to award broad injunctive relief in the circumstances and manner in which it did. The Robinson principle requires an individualized determination, and the lower court's failure to require such a determination and its issuance of much broader injunctive relief has led to the problems at issue that the Petitioner and its amici have raised, not the core principle of Robinson.\n\nAnd, therefore, we urge the Court to adhere to the core principle of Robinson but to emphasize that cities have flexibility to implement these and, in particular, time, place, and manner restrictions on where someone can sleep are entirely valid if they are reasonable, and, indeed, the state law establishes a state policy that time, manner, and place restrictions are the way to go if they are reasonable.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Wouldn't you have a better argument if Robinson involved someone being arrested for using drugs, but then the Court said that you were in effect arresting him for the status of a drug user because he had no choice but to use drugs because he's an addict?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No. Our position is not that the conduct as in Robinson, the drug addict can't stop from using drugs. That is not our position. That's a question of personal culpability on the basis of what the substances make up—\n\nJudge: So what's the difference between that and camping out? What you're saying here, it seems as though you're saying, well, there’s no other choice, so you have to camp out. Therefore, you're really arresting this person for the status of homelessness.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, but not because of an involuntary compulsion sense. I think, as another judge pointed out, the nexus here is actually closer than in the addiction situation because sleeping outside is essentially the mirror image or the other side of the coin or the definition—\n\nJudge: Well, I agree that the distinction between status and conduct is a slippery one and that they're often closely related. In Robinson, though, the Court said you cannot make the status of being a drug addict a crime, but you can criminalize the conduct, even if it is involuntary and compulsive. And another case reaffirmed that line very strongly and said we're not going to go further.\n\nAnd I wonder whether the government is asking us to take that step that the previous case counseled against by saying that it is effectively status, and this is throughout your brief. You use the word \"effective\" or \"essentially\" or \"tantamount to,\" those kinds of words. And so I just wanted to get your response to that concern.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we are not asking the Court to take the step that it declined to take in that previous case, which had to do with personal responsibility—\n\nJudge: Okay. If you're—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —in this Court's decision.\n\nJudge: —not asking us to do that, then I just want to circle back to what was asked earlier, which is, surely, the government wants to continue to enforce the drug laws and all kinds of other laws that people could make an argument that they had an involuntary need to do, a necessity defense. You don’t want us to wipe out all those laws?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Absolutely not, but what is different here is that the conduct in that previous case would have been based on the person's own separate—\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —antisocial conduct. Here—\n\nJudge: Well, another case made clear that some people are going to be forced to drink in public because they don't have a home.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: He made this very point.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we don’t—but the point here, it is the government that is prohibiting the alternative. It’s not the individual’s inability to control his own conduct. The government, because the person—because of other circumstances, the lack of money, the lack of a friend to stay with, the lack of shelter space, there is no place—we take as a given in our position that there is no other place for the person to sleep—\n\nJudge: And I think, wouldn’t—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —and as the government—\n\nJudge: —couldn’t a drug addict, though, make the exact same argument? \"I had no other choice.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But that is—that is—that—the other choice would be a matter of—of personal—\n\nJudge: No. Say the record says—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —understanding, personal culpability.\n\nJudge: But the record says that there is no other choice. \"I had to do it.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I—I do think that engaging in conduct that is unrelated to—let me take that back. The sleeping outside when you have no other place to go is the definition of homelessness.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer, isn’t the response—\n\nJudge: But Judge—\n\nJudge: —also that those two things are different? I mean, you're sort of saying it’s about individual culpability. But it’s not as though everyone engages in drug use.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Right? Certain people do, and maybe they have addiction, and maybe you can’t punish them because of the addiction, but you can still punish them as criminally culpable for engaging in the act. It seems to me we are in a totally different category—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We are, yes.\n\nJudge: —when you’re talking about acts that everybody participates in, that no one thinks in and of themselves are criminally culpable. And yet somehow this statute is reaching out to punish certain people who engage in that universal human basic need. That seems to me to be the distinction—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: —in these situations.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That is a critical distinction, and not only is it something that everybody engages in, but it's something that everybody has to engage in to be alive.\n\nSo, if you can’t sleep, you can’t live, and, therefore, by prohibiting sleeping, the city is basically saying you cannot live in Grants Pass. It’s the equivalent of banishment, which is something that is unknown to the way—\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer—\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer—\n\nJudge: Wasn't Grant Pass's first attempt, policy choice, to put homeless people on buses so they would leave the city? I understood that to be the history of Grant Pass.

Let's assume it's not an agency.\r\n\r\nThere's a motion to intervene by a party.\r\n\r\nAre they required to appeal?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\r\n\r\nIf they --if they want to become parties, they --if they are denied intervention, then -- and they want to have the rights and obligations that go with party status in the underlying litigation, they would need to appeal from the denial of intervention.\r\n\r\nAnd if they lost there, they couldn't take an appeal from the merits judgment in the case and essentially ask for a second bite at the apple, ask the court of appeals in the merits appeal to revisit the question of whether intervention should be granted.\r\n\r\nJudge: We would never --\r\n\r\nJudge: Why should --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- have any ending to litigation if parties who want to intervene could come in at any point in time, even after judgment, raising new issues, when they weren't parties below?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Why shouldn't Fasken have been allowed to intervene?

That is, the Hobbs Act requires that you be a party, but at least under the terms of the statute, there is no requirement that, as a party, you raise the same issue that you want to raise in court.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Stewart, I understand your argument to be that the \"party aggrieved\" language in the Hobbs Act is narrower than the \"person adversely affected\" language in the APA.\r\n\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Would anything prohibit Fasken or Texas from bringing an APA challenge in district court under -- as -- as persons aggrieved?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think the exclusive review scheme of the Hobbs Act would -- would do that, unless the Court concluded for some reason that the Hobbs Act review scheme was inadequate and that the exclusivity of the -- the court of appeals review scheme should be accepted for that -- made an exception to for that reason.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nThe -- the ultra vires argument perhaps could be brought there, you think?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I don't think ultra vires really maps on to what the Court has looked to at least recently because the ultra vires exception turns on kind of how -- how bad is the agency error alleged to be or did it represent a -- an exercise of authority that the agency doesn't have.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But the plurality held that that independent intervening act still broke proximate cause.\r\n\r\nI think it goes back to the Court's 1876 decision in the St. Paul Railway case, where you made clear that if there is a sufficient and independent cause --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nIt wasn't me. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYour Honor, I -- I -- I think of the Court as a collective body that operates across time.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nAnd it made clear -- it made --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nJustice Gorsuch doesn't believe that.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nYes, I do.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nAnd it made quite clear way back in 1876 when you do have that, and I'm quoting, a sufficient and independent cause operating between the wrong and the injury, that does break the chain of causation even if it's eminently foreseeable, just like many, many, many years later in the Hemi Group case, the Court concluded the same even though it was eminently foreseeable that the retailer's failure to file the tax reports could lead to lost tax revenue.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nMr. Francisco, can I just put a point on this? Because I want to make sure I understand the -- the line of questions you've been asked. So it seems to me as Justice Thomas began that when we're talking about the statute that was the violation at the beginning, for the predicate, it has to be a statute that was specifically applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, the gun.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nJustice Sotomayor asked you.\r\n\r\nSo that's the retailer selling it to the bad guy, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nThat's where the proximate cause inquiry comes in.\r\n\r\nYour client -- the theory, right? The theory is that your client under 2, under Example 2, has aided and abetted as the manufacturer. Proximate cause doesn't appear in that portion of the statute.\r\n\r\nIt's only in the predicate portion.\r\n\r\nSo, if we accept that framing of the theory, the framing of the complaint, we're really only asking about proximate cause, as Justice Gorsuch was asking you, between the retailer, the sale, and the harm ultimately caused to Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnd then we're looking at the chain of events that you're talking at right now: sale to the bad guy, smuggled across the border, misuse.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nSo I think I have two responses, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe first is I actually disagree with how you framed it.\r\n\r\nBut the second is, even if I accept how you framed it, I still think there's no proximate cause.\r\n\r\nThe statute says that there has to be proximate cause between our violation and Mexico's injury.\r\n\r\nOur violation is not the illegal sale itself.\r\n\r\nIt's the actions that we undertake to aid and abet it, the violative aiding and abetting conduct.\r\n\r\nSo --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nHow does that fit in the statute, though?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYour Honor, because I think the statute says it's a -- the statute requires that -- sets forth the exception where a seller has knowingly violated an applicable statute and the violation, referring to the seller's violation --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nBut it's not just applicable statute.\r\n\r\nIt's statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\r\n\r\nSo that seems to me to refer to a specific statute relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution of guns, not the aiding-and-abetting statute, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nWell, I think it's got to refer to our violation.\r\n\r\nIt refers back to the seller's violation.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, the seller hasn't specifically -- and this maybe goes to the confusion that Justice Thomas pointed out. But the seller's violation is not the actual retail sale.\r\n\r\nWe're not retail sellers.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nThe seller's violation here is the aiding and abetting of that retail sale.\r\n\r\nAnd I presume what they are invoking is the federal aiding-and-abetting statute, and they're trying to combine that with the actual specific sale.\r\n\r\nSo I think there are all kinds of problems with their theory --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nI guess I don't get that, Mr. Francisco.\r\n\r\nI mean, aiding and abetting is a form of vicarious liability.\r\n\r\nWhy wouldn't you just say the aiding-and-abetting violation is the violation that is aided and abetted, which, here, as Justice Barrett said, is the retail sale, say the sale to a straw purchaser?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nSure, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nI think it's -- I'm just trying to construct the statute properly, and I think, as a matter of proper statutory construction, that's where you begin the proximate cause, with our violation.\r\n\r\nBut I don't really want to fight about it because --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell, your violation, as a matter of vicarious liability, is the violation that the retail seller, you know, sells to the straw purchaser.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYour Honor, I'm not sure that's right, but -- but, again, I'm willing to assume for the sake of argument that it is right because I still think that there's no proximate cause in between the illegal retail sale and Mexico's injury off in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnd I sure don't think that they've come anywhere close to establishing aiding-and-abetting liability. I've already explained why I think there are multiple independent crimes after the retail sale, in addition to the smuggle across an international border and the murder and mayhem committed independently by cartels in Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo me, that is more than sufficient to break that chain.\r\n\r\nBut, in any event, I think that their theory of aiding-and-abetting liability is equally farfetched.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nSo, with reference to aiding and abetting, could you just explain to me the sort of structure of this industry? Who are these distributors? Are they pass-through entities? Are they completely independent? Might they be both? What -- what -- what -- what's the --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nThey're independent entities, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that there might be some internal distribution, but, by and large, a manufacturer makes the firearms.\r\n\r\nThen there are distributors who purchase the firearms from different manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThose distributors then sell firearms to retailers.\r\n\r\nEveryone in this chain is fully licensed.\r\n\r\nThe retailers then are fully licensed and they sell to purchasers.\r\n\r\nThe allegation is some small percentage of those sales are illegal and we know it.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "442", "dialogue": "Judge\nWell, but that's what I want to hear from you, which is: Which is the clearest and -- and more --most succinct way to articulate the concept so that we're not saying that merely commingling is what throws you out of the courtroom?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI think the rule is that to establish an exchange, the item at the beginning and the item at the end of the proposed transaction have to be given in return for one another.\n\nAnd -- and I recognize that \"return\" is a synonym for \"exchange,\" and potentially more judicial gloss could be placed on the phrase.\n\nBut, typically, when I'm saying that I give Item A in return for Item B, I'm seeing -- I'm saying that I -- I gave Item A for the reason that I received Item B.\n\nThere's some real and substantial connection between those two things.\n\nJudge\nNow you're not using the word \"tracing.\" Why?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n\"Trace\" in this context means to connect, so you have to establish a real and substantial connection at --at a bare minimum.\n\nJudge\nDo we have to go to either of the two additional questions you presented to us?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nNo, the Court doesn't have to address those issues.\n\nThere's a number of decisional paths that are available.\n\nAnd perhaps the easiest one is to say that the facts as alleged here or even based upon the evidence submitted by Respondents does not establish that interest payments made in 2005 were exchanged for the items taken in 1944.\n\nCertainly, the other two issues are presented, and the Court could reach its ultimate conclusion by way of either or both, but perhaps the easiest way to do it is to simply say that this theory fails under any standard.\n\nJudge\nMr. Glasgow, in your --in your exchange with Justice Sotomayor, you mentioned the word \"tracing,\" but --but we kind of dance around that.\n\nThere -- there's a rich case law about tracing when a fiduciary takes funds.\n\nWhat extent should that inform us?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI think the common law doctrines regarding tracing are of limited value here because whatever --\n\nJudge\nWhy? Let me just push back on that for a second. Both sides lean awful heavily on the word \"exchange,\" and you've got your dictionary, they've got theirs.\n\nThat's great.\n\nBut why should we ignore that body of case law that's been developed over a very long period of time to deal with this kind of problem? Why wouldn't we assume that Congress meant to adopt or at least reference it?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nFor two primary reasons. First, you have to look at the statutory text.\n\nWe have to start with that text.\n\nAnd I don't think there's any real dispute about what the ordinary meaning is. Those trust law rules are not based on an ordinary meaning of \"exchange.\" And, second, I think many --and it depends on which specific rules we're talking about, but many of the traditional common law rules regarding fiduciary duties, for example, are legal fictions.\n\nYou'll find any number of cases describing them as such.\n\nAnd the jurisdiction of the federal courts should not be expanded by way of legal fiction.\n\nThat's simply not permissible under our structure of government.\n\nJudge\nLet me return to Justice Sotomayor's question to you.\n\nWhat's the test? It's not tracing.\n\nYou know, you said \"real and substantial connection,\" but that doesn't really seem connected to \"exchange.\" So give me something to hold onto that --that does bear some relationship to the text if you don't want to pull from traditional fiduciary law.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI think you can use the ordinary meaning that Respondents have posited, that you have to say that the item at the end of the transaction was given in return for the item at the beginning of the transaction.\n\nAnd that's --obviously, there are -- there are edge cases that you can imagine, but, in the vast majority of cases, that's a simple test that -- that ordinary language is fully capable of handling.\n\nJudge\nIs it turning on intent when you say you give something for something else? Like I'm intending to use the pot of money that I expropriated in order to obtain this? Is it -- I don't understand how -- you said it's easy in the mine run of cases to look and see, but I'm not sure why it's easy. What am I looking for?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nSo I think the -- in the vast majority of cases, an exchange is -- is simple and obvious, a swap.\n\nOne person gives one thing and receives another in return.\n\nAnd that's -- that's the type of thing that Congress was looking at.\n\nYou know, in the Sabbatino case, of course, there's the -- the shipload of sugar given in return for a bill of lading that's negotiated for a specific and identifiable pot of cash.\n\nThose are the kind of core cases that Congress was thinking about.\n\nCertainly, you can imagine more difficult cases, but this isn't one of them. I'm providing substantial connection as -- as a bare minimum.\n\nI think that it probably is not a matter of intent.\n\nTo the extent you really had to dig for additional judicial gloss, I might say it's something like causation: The reason I gave you Item A is because I received Item B and vice versa.\n\nBut I think that sort of deep analysis really isn't required here.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "621", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, I wanted to ask you some of the same questions I asked earlier about how these cases will be tried if your view of the law prevails. So I asked about the admissibility of the judgment of conviction, the charging document, the jury instructions, and the plea colloquy. Do you think all of that is admissible?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, in addition to the hearsay exceptions that might cover those, I think, to the extent you're submitting documents that were just shown to the jury and are being used for the purpose of showing what the jury was instructed, as opposed to for the truth of the matter asserted, there isn’t a hearsay problem with those.\n\nJudge: Now suppose the rule is that judges have usually regarded things that are separated by more than a day as having occurred on separate occasions. Suppose the documents don’t clearly specify the exact day on which the offense occurred—one says \"on or about March 27th,\" and another says \"on or about March 30th.\" Is that sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they occurred on separate occasions? If not, would you need to call witnesses from those prior trials to establish the exact day?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I do think that would be enough for a jury to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that they occurred on different occasions, particularly if other aspects of the crimes are different.\n\nJudge: Were judges making that determination beyond a reasonable doubt under the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. I think a jury could infer that, for example, a robbery on March 28th and an assault on March 30th would be separate occasions, particularly if there is no contrary argument connecting them.\n\nJudge: Now, regarding differences in the nature of the offenses—if the offenses are sufficiently different, that may support the conclusion that they were not committed on the same occasion. Suppose a defendant committed a robbery in the morning by grabbing a woman’s purse and running away, then committed a mugging with a knife in the evening, and the next morning stole $500 worth of merchandise from a store. Would these be considered separate occasions?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, I think they would be.\n\nJudge: On what basis? What would the judge instruct the jury?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Your Honor, I take separate occasions to mean that Congress intended to address cases where multiple offenses arise from a single act. But when you have three different kinds of offenses, even over a short period, as you described, I think that’s presumptively separate occasions. Of course, the jury would still need to evaluate the evidence, and the defendant could argue otherwise, but I would expect a jury to find them to be separate occasions unless substantial contrary evidence is presented.\n\nJudge: All right, thank you.\n\nJudge: I heard you mention that there have been four trials of this kind. What did those trials look like? Were they bifurcated?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Do you always expect to bifurcate?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Unless there’s some unforeseen reason not to, we generally agree to bifurcation. However, in many cases, the defendant may choose to plead or enter into a stipulation instead.\n\nJudge: And what did those trials look like?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They looked like normal bifurcated proceedings. We proved the primary offense first, and then there was a separate jury consideration of the sentencing enhancement. We introduced evidence about the prior crimes, presented arguments, and the jury deliberated on those questions separately.\n\nJudge: There has been some discussion about how difficult this process will be. Was it difficult in practice?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, this was not our first-choice position. We have argued against this view for a long time. However, while this process imposes some burden on us, we believe it is manageable. ACCA cases make up less than 1 percent of the federal criminal docket, and with the availability of pleas, stipulations, and bifurcations, we are reasonably confident that we can handle this process.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So we think that there's something fundamentally wrong, fundamentally bad, about youth who are -- are trying to transition.\n\nAnd that's the way this purpose seems to me.\n\nJudge: If I could try to unpack both of those, Your Honor, because I think both of those, read in context, do not support the narrative that Tennessee wants boys to live as boys and girls to live as girls.\n\nSo the \"appreciate their sex\" reference in --detailed in legislative findings, that is simply the recognition that given the high desistance rate among minors and given the tragic regret of detransitioners, that there is an interest in making sure that minors have enough time to appreciate their sex before undergoing life-altering changes. So I think that that has to be viewed in the context of the legislative findings, with --which both emphasize the detransitioners and the high rate of desistance.\n\nWith respect to \"become disdainful of their sex,\" the -- the challengers have never explained why it would be problematic to prevent interventions that could affirmatively cause minors to become disdainful of their sex and thus at issue for psychiatric conditions.\n\nAnd, in fact, there are multiple studies, I would point to this Court JA 400, where minors -- actually, their mental health and suicidality got worse after taking these interventions.\n\nNow my friends on the other side may disagree with that research and that assessment of whether -- the findings of that study, but the legislature specifically noted those studies.\n\nSo I think that statement was rooted in the notion that, actually, this is causing affirmative harm to minors who are undergoing the interventions, and that's why they were saying we don't want these interventions that will cause minors to become disdainful of their sex.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: At a --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Go ahead.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, go ahead.

The Court said that for purposes of that provision, only the notice to appear is relevant. So, even though it refers generally to 1229, the notice to appear is the only notice that's being referred to there.

I assume that non-citizens would challenge it under this statute as well.\n\nAnd I think the fact that this has never happened in more than 500,000 in absentia removals is proof that we have no incentive whatsoever to do that.\n\nJudge: Would aliens have an incentive to challenge that as a due process violation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They could.\n\nWe haven't taken a position on the due process issue, but I think that's a viable argument that they could at least raise.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: No.\n\nJudge: Justice Kagan?\n\nJudge: I mean, the reason I asked earlier about suppose not a blank piece of paper, but suppose you just stopped telling people about their right to counsel, how that would be cured, what would prevent it, because that kind of thing seems both more likely to me and more difficult to remedy through anything -- any of the supposed safeguards that you've talked about.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, if I can maybe address the question about whether that's more likely, I think it's important to recognize that the notice to appear is a form document.\n\nIt's not as though the notice to --\n\nJudge: Well, it is now, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nAnd, you know, maybe somebody will say, why are we -- why are we telling people that they have this right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, if -- you know, non-citizens don't have the right to have counsel during these proceedings, they have the right to be informed that they could obtain counsel.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If a non-citizen is --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nBut, you know, that's a useful thing for a non-citizen to know.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I'm not disputing that.\n\nAnd that's why we put that in the -- the notice to appear.\n\nJudge: And so tomorrow you decide not to.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If we were to decide not to put that information into the notice to appear, I would still say that that notice to appear can validly be used to start the removal proceeding, but the non-citizen, if they come to the hearing, as they should, can say, I was never informed of the right to counsel and, therefore, I shouldn't have been -- you know, I should get that opportunity.\n\nJudge: Not that we have to start all over again? That's -- I mean, what law would -- would the non-citizen at that point invoke under -- under your theory of the statute?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the regulations and the statute have been interpreted as a claim processing rule.\n\nIf we don't comply with all of the requirements of the claim processing rule, there are questions about exactly what the remedy is.\n\nSome courts have said the remedy is a new proceeding.\n\nSome courts have said that the remedy is that the government gives an opportunity to cure. So, in your scenario, I think the remedy would be that we give the non-citizen time to obtain counsel and we inform them of their right.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Gorsuch?\n\nJudge: I'm not sure if I understand in the first place your -- your response to Justice Thomas and -- and -- and Justice Sotomayor about Pereira and particularly the most troublesome language for you about \"change\" meaning something other than what the government is currently suggesting. As I understand it, we would have to say, first, that's dicta and, second, it's incorrect, is that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nAnd that's exactly the analysis the Court undertook in the Kirtsaeng case, where it confronted a very similar statement.\n\nJudge: Got it, okay.\n\nI -- I understand my hypotheticals about a blank sheet are hypotheticals, but it's not hypothetical that the government has long issued NTAs that are non-compliant and that it concedes it did so in the cases presently before us, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: And then I wanted to ask you about the provision in the in absentia removal statute that says that you can remove somebody if they've -- an alien if -- if he has failed to supply his address. Doesn't that fairly suggest that the alien has first received a compliant notice to appear telling him, as the statute requires, that he must supply his address?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, and that's what the Board held in the In re G-Y-R- decision that's cited in our reply brief.\n\nIt said, if you never received a notice that informed you of that requirement, you can't be ordered in absentia --\n\nJudge: I -- I understand that's your response, that, oh, don't worry. Okay? But I think the logic of your argument is, if he fails to appear for a notice of change hearing, your -- and -- and the notice of change statement notice was itself compliant, forget about the NTA, you're good to go in absentia removal.\n\nThat's -- that's the -- that's how you're asking us to read the statute presently. Now you're adding a qualifier and saying: Well, not with respect to addresses if the NTA didn't ask him for his address.\n\nBut where in the statute does that come from? When I look at the in absentia removal provision as you read it, if I'm to take your logic seriously, that's irrelevant.\n\nNow it's nice that you have a Board decision and -- and -- or a regulation, but I'm again asking you as a matter of statutory interpretation how that argument hangs together.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the answer as a matter of statutory interpretation is that if you look at 1229(b)(B), it refers to --\n\nJudge: 1229?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "643", "dialogue": "Judge: I suppose someone could also initiate a class action of the sort that happened here if the necessity defense was not allowed to operate, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Potentially.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Thank you.\n\nJudge: You've said several times that this is a difficult and complicated policy question. How does this law help address those issues?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: One of the biggest challenges is getting people the help they need. Laws like this allow cities to intervene and incentivize people to accept shelter. For example, Ms. Johnson stated in her deposition that she does not wish to stay at the Gospel Rescue Mission because of her dog. She also has other personal reasons, like disliking being around people. Everyone’s situation is complex.\n\nJudge: How does this law help if there are not enough shelter beds for the number of homeless individuals in the jurisdiction?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Ms. Johnson sometimes stays with a friend, so there are other options.\n\nJudge: I'm asking more generally.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: If there is a mismatch between the number of available shelter beds and the number of homeless people, some individuals will inevitably have nowhere to go.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is a difficult policy question.\n\nJudge: How does this law help with that issue?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It encourages people to accept alternative options when available so fewer people end up camping. Additionally, living in public spaces without infrastructure creates harm for both the individuals and the broader community. Encampments can lead to unsafe conditions and increased crime. The city has an interest in protecting everyone.\n\nJudge: Should the constitutional rule be different when the number of available beds exceeds the number of homeless individuals compared to when there are more homeless people than beds?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. We've seen in the Ninth Circuit that trying to count available beds and determine who is willing to take them is unworkable. Then the question shifts to whether those beds are adequate.\n\nJudge: That's a separate issue, I agree. Let me ask one last question. How does the necessity defense differ from the constitutional rule?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The necessity defense involves weighing the harm caused by the individual’s conduct. For example, if someone camps near a school or engages in particularly harmful behavior when they have another place to go, that would be considered under the necessity defense. It is a narrower argument. In Oregon, for example, individuals growing marijuana for medical reasons without a license were denied the necessity defense because they could have obtained a license. Similarly, if a person has a friend to stay with or a bed available at a shelter, they would be expected to take it under the necessity defense.\n\nJudge: One last question. If someone goes through the citation cycle, ends up in jail for 30 days, and is released, how does this law help them? They still don’t have a place to go.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I want to clarify that the trespass law here is only triggered after multiple civil citations.\n\nJudge: Right. But if someone completes that cycle and is incarcerated, what happens when they are released? They’re still in the same situation if there aren’t enough shelter beds unless they leave the jurisdiction.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. There are services available, and the jurisdiction can connect individuals with programs to help them in those circumstances. For many people, that intervention is what enables them to enter treatment. This approach has saved lives.\n\nJudge: Okay.

It is still accurate.\n\nIt's just that I did not take care to obviate what was probably a foreseeable inference that you would have thought I won a contested match.\n\nAnd it's the -- the difference between the statement itself directly stating something inaccurate in context and leading the listener down a path.\n\nJudge\nAnd do we know what the Seventh Circuit means by this phrase when they use it in -- this term when they use it in their opinions?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nI can't say we know for sure, but I will say that the court was, of course, thinking about the facts before it, which was this numerical understatement fact pattern.\n\nAnd we can look to the parts of the opinion where the court said that in -- that the unmistakable impression left by Petitioner's words was that he only borrowed this amount.\n\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nJustice Thomas, anything?

There -- there really is a difference.\n\nIn some -- there might be overlap, but there really is a difference, some things that are super misleading but that are not false.\n\nYour example of the tennis player, my example of the surgeon.\n\nWhy not just say that and instruct the Seventh Circuit and anybody else who may not have a correct understanding of this that there -- there is this gap?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah, I would not resist this Court explaining that.\n\nI just am only resisting the possibility that you could say this statute does not criminalize misleading representations, full stop, without explaining that falsity by context counts, what that means and that also leaving open the possibility that the facts here, where the Petitioner, in response to a statement saying he owed a certain amount, said: I'm shocked by that, and I owed this different amount, that that could not -- a juror could not find as a matter of law that that is false.\n\nJudge\nJustice Gorsuch?

But, in Mata, I thought the Court made clear that the INA's grant of jurisdiction over final orders of removal encompasses review of decisions refusing to reopen or reconsider such orders.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's true.\r\n\r\nJudge: Here, we have a decision refusing to reconsider or reopen. Nasrallah did not involve a decision refusing to reconsider or reopen.\r\n\r\nSo why doesn't Mata's determination that those kinds of decisions actually do --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because Mata recognizes that reopening and reconsideration can be subject to review.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't say everything.\r\n\r\nSo, for instance, take an alien who's a -- a -- a soccer fan and says: I want -- I move for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nI want you to include in your opinion the statement I'm as good of a soccer player as Lionel Messi.\r\n\r\nNow it --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think you should trivialize this case, Mr. Yang.\r\n\r\nJudge: No, this is actually --and -- and this is --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, no, no, no, because it doesn't affect the final order of removal.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, it is --\r\n\r\nJudge: But, Mr. Yang, Mata says that there are certain categories of orders, those that go to reopening and remove -- reconsideration that do count as final orders of removal.\r\n\r\nThat seems to me to be a simple, clear line that judges can apply when we determine whether or not we have jurisdiction, and it's one that makes sense.\r\n\r\nYou want us to drill down.\r\n\r\nOnly certain finals -- only certain orders of reopening or reconsideration count.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's hard to avoid the \"final order of removal\" language because that's where the only jurisdictional grant is.\r\n\r\nJudge: I'm not avoiding it. I'm saying Mata interpreted it.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the --\r\n\r\nJudge: Mata interpreted \"final orders of removal\" to \"encompass review of decisions refusing to reopen or reconsider such orders.\" And we have --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: And we're not --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- such a decision in this case.\r\n\r\nWhat I hear you saying is, yes, but only certain decisions that refuse to reopen or reconsider count, and you want us to look at the extent to which the person, in their application, made certain arguments. It seems like a very technical way to go about this when we have a case that already interprets motions -- or --or decisions that encompass review of refusing to reopen or reconsider as final orders of removal for this purpose.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mata did not say that every motion to reopen and every motion to reconsider, regardless of what it concerns, is subject to the jurisdictional provision.\r\n\r\nAnd our point is most --most are included.\r\n\r\nJudge: But why -- why wouldn't it be? Why wouldn't it be? We -- we are talking about the power of the court --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- to hear a person's claim.\r\n\r\nWe're not saying whether or not his claim is meritorious, whether or not -- why wouldn't the rule that makes sense, that Congress intended when it was talking about jurisdiction be that the final order of removal and any subsequent attempts to get the court to revisit or get the agency to revisit through a motion for reopening or a motion for reconsideration all fits in the umbrella of things that the court would review?\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because, when the issue concerns a matter as collateral as this and, in addition --\r\n\r\nJudge: It's not collateral because it relates to the final order of removal in the way that Mata indicated.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: And, in addition, where you have judicial review elsewhere, Congress would have thought that those collateral consequences could be pursued but in a different judicial forum in a different way.\r\n\r\nIt's not unusual here, when --we're talking about removal proceedings, where it doesn't affect the order of removal in any way. It really doesn't.\r\n\r\nThis is all collateral. This order of removal is unchanged. There's not a word on that page in, what is it, 42 and 43a that would change. Nothing.\r\n\r\nThey say it would change.\r\n\r\nBut, like, how are you going to change it? Notice: If you fail to voluntarily depart, the following will happen.\r\n\r\nThat's right, nothing's changing there.\r\n\r\nThe only collateral consequences arise from the subsequent --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, but the meaning of that provision has changed.\r\n\r\nI mean -- and that provision is in the overall order of removal.\r\n\r\nYou're insisting on saying that the order of removal is just the --the -- the conclusion as to removability.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, it has --it makes reference to other matters, including voluntary departure.\r\n\r\nAnd the meaning of the voluntary departure provision, how it's implemented, how it operates on the ground, completely changes depending on whose view of timeliness one adopts.\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: The order doesn't change. It's no different than a sentence, a criminal sentence.\r\n\r\nIf the criminal sentence says: We're going to impose supervised release, and if you commit a federal crime while on supervised release, it's a violation.\r\n\r\nThat judgment doesn't say you've committed another federal crime.\r\n\r\nYou've got to wait for a separate order about whether or not you violated the terms of supervised release. That's the same here.\r\n\r\nThis is simply saying: If the following happens, these are consequences. The -- the separate order that really addresses whether they happened is the motion to reopen, which they're not challenging, and a motion for reconsideration, which they are.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the only thing they're challenging, and it doesn't affect the final order of removal.\r\n\r\nI think it's also important to just note the consequences or the penalty that's imposed by c(d) of a monetary sanction or ineligibility for certain relief, like cancellation and adjustment of status, only applies if the noncitizen voluntarily fails to depart in the time period specified.\r\n\r\nAnd the Board has interpreted that provision in a case called Zmijewska.\r\n\r\nIt's 21 I&N Decision 89.\r\n\r\nAnd the court --the Board said: You do not voluntarily fail to depart if, through no fault of your own, you're unaware of the grant of voluntary departure or you're physically unable to depart.\r\n\r\nSo my point by this discussion is to explain that whether or not the noncitizen is subject to these penalties is a separate inquiry.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Yang, can I -- can I just interrupt --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- and ask you a question.\r\n\r\nSo you didn't make this argument in the Tenth Circuit.\r\n\r\nHave you -- has the government made this in any court?\r\n\r", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

The information the government gave, though redacted, didn’t provide much. You could simply say, “We think he’s a member of a gang based on our contacts with law enforcement,” period. How would that implicate any serious governmental interest?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, it would go beyond any of the Court’s previous cases and beyond what is often given in similar cases, beyond what Congress requires in cases involving denials under (a)(2) and (a)(3).\n\nJudge: No.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: Of course, it does, but we are asking what due process and Mandel may require. If the Ninth Circuit says it requires more than a statutory citation but less than revealing intelligence, then a sentence would suffice—which is what they said. Do you have any objection to that? Is that wrong?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We do think that the statutory citation ought to be enough for the reasons explained in previous rulings.\n\nJudge: But that was a—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: —different statute. A totally different statute. The statute in that case contained the kinds of sentences that I think we are discussing here, relating to terrorist activities. It didn’t just say “terrorist activities, period.” Identifying a subsection provided some factual basis for the determination. But that’s not happening here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That would be true if we had identified particular subsections of the terrorist activities bar, but in that case, we just cited the entire terrorist activities bar.\n\nJudge: But there were six—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —Justice Breyer’s dissent talked about—\n\nJudge: —there were six discrete terrorist acts described. Here, the statute only states “any other unlawful activity.” It’s a generalist catch-all for “security and related grounds.” Your brief even suggests that the ground must be tied to security, but we don’t know what security means here. The way it’s written, you could deny entry based on something as minor as a jaywalking conviction or stealing a piece of bread as a child. Some countries even criminalize children for such acts. How does a citation to unlawful activity tell anybody anything? At least in the D.C. Circuit case, you stated the person was a member of a criminal organization. That tells you something.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That does tell more, I agree.\n\nJudge: Well, but—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We have not applied the statute in cases involving jaywalking, and this wouldn’t just cover past criminal offenses. It requires a reasonable belief that the person will commit unlawful activity upon entry into the U.S. That is why gang membership has been considered an indicator since 1965.\n\nJudge: Right, but—\n\nJudge: The point is, saying, “We think you will commit some kind of criminal activity,” does not tell a person anything. But saying, “We think you’re an MS-13 member,” does. If someone isn’t actually a member, they would know how to contest that finding. There’s a big difference between these two statements. Both are a single sentence, but one provides a way to challenge the determination, and the other does not.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I understand that point, but I don’t think that’s the point of Mandel review. The purpose of Mandel review isn’t to scrutinize the agency’s reasoning or improve their decision-making. It’s simply to confirm that the government had a reason that was facially legitimate and bona fide. It’s more of a spot check.\n\nJudge: But how does simply stating “unlawful activity” fulfill that purpose?\n\nJudge: Mr.—\n\nJudge: How does saying, “We think you committed unlawful activity,” meet that requirement?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We think the person is—\n\nJudge: Going to.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —going to commit unlawful activity.\n\nJudge: Excuse me.

{"id": "715", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: So I see the -- the standard, \"significantly interferes,\" in the actual text of the statute, and I'm trying to understand whether this really is sort of an unusual or unworkable assignment for the courts.\nSo can you help me to sort of contemplate how if at all this \"significantly interferes\" standard is any different from, you know, similar standards in other statutes?\nSo last term, in Roth, we looked at a statute that asks whether religious accommodation would impose an \"undue hardship\" on the conduct of the employer's business.\nRFRA imposes a \"substantial burden\" test.\nSo isn't this sort of in the nature of statutory standards of this kind and the Court looks at them and we make a decision, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Absolutely, that's -- that's correct.\n\nJudge: All right.\nAnd then, with respect to the arduous nature of this and sort of, you know, what has to be proven, I guess I'm wondering, doesn't what is necessary to be established to meet this standard depend on the reason that the bank says the statutory standard is being met in a particular case?\nSo, you know, the bank says we are pointing to this preemption provision and we say that it -- that -- that what is going on here with this state law significantly interferes with our powers, and then I guess they go on to say how, how is that happening.\nSo, when they say this significantly interferes with my powers because it directly conflicts with what the statute says about our authority, which is what I understood was happening in, you know, Barnett Bank and Franklin, then I guess the Court doesn't have to have a bunch of depositions or anything. They're doing sort of a statutory analysis.\nIs that right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's right.\n\nJudge: All right.\nAnd when they say instead this significantly interferes with my power because it imposes an undue burden, I suppose the bank would then be charged by the Court with proving that.\nHow burdensome is this? What --what -- give me evidence, says the Court.\nAm I right about that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct, yes.\n\nJudge: And so, similarly, if it significantly interferes, if they say it's a significant interference, again, we're in the realm of evidence, and we're doing this on a case-by-case basis because that's what the statute says you have to do?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: All right. Thank you.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\nDefense Lawyer.\n\nDefense Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make three quick points before taking questions.\nThe first is that the Court shouldn't assume that the word \"significantly\" either in the opinion of the Court in Barnett Bank or in the statute itself is devoid of significance.\nIf Congress wanted a statute that said state law is preempted when it forces the bank to deviate in any way from what it would otherwise do, it wouldn't have used the word \"significantly,\" it would have used another formulation.\n\nSecond, in Franklin National Bank, the Court didn't suggest that all state law restrictions on national bank advertising were preempted.\nIt emphasized that the word \"savings\" was the very word that Congress had used in the statutes to describe the product at issue and that it was the very word that in consumers' minds was most closely linked to the product.\nAnd as the Plaintiff's lawyer explained at trial, the bank in that case presented extensive evidence that it would be hindered in its ability to obtain savings accounts if it couldn't use that word.\n\nAnd, last, I'd say, the Court should look not only at Franklin, the case the Court cited in Barnett Bank as an example of a preemptive statute, but also at Anderson National Bank. Anderson National Bank involved a state-abandoned deposit law.\nIt authorized the state to take over the deposit, force the bank to turn over a deposit from -- to the state upon proof that the account had been inactive for a specified period of time. And it's hard to imagine a more direct interference with the bank's ability to do business than telling the bank you would prefer to hold the money and earn income on it, but we require you to turn it over to us.\n\nBut the Court explained for various reasons that this was not -- would not substantially interfere with the way the bank did business.\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, is there a difference in the treatment of incidental powers versus the express power you mentioned in Franklin?\n\nDefense Lawyer: I don't think generally. I mean, incidental powers are powers, as you know, that are not enumerated in the statute, and interference with an incidental power can cause indirect harm to the bank's ability to exercise the express power.\nI would point out that the Court in Barnett Bank, in the sentence immediately preceding the one that we've been focused on, said the prior cases, the ones that have found preemption, take the view that normally Congress would not want states to forbid or to impair significantly the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\n\nSo it was focusing on express powers there, and it was saying, even with respect to express powers, the interference has to be -- the impairment has to be significant.\nThe control test doesn't apply to express powers. So I don't think there's a meaningful difference.\n\nJudge: Counsel, do you agree with the Plaintiff's lawyer that determining whether something is significant is -- would be something you can do without trial evidence?\n\nDefense Lawyer: I mean, certainly, if the OCC were doing it, it would have kind of a preexisting body of information about the way the national banks operate, and it might be able to draw on that font of experience in determining whether restrictions that might seem innocuous to a layperson could, in fact, predictably have a significant adverse effect on the bank's business.\n\nI think the Plaintiff's lawyer was also alluding to the Court's decision in Morales, which involved the Airline Deregulation Act, in which the Court explained how the state false advertising law would impair the airlines' ability to engage in the pricing practices that they wanted to engage in.\n\nAnd the Court didn't make quite clear exactly where the information about the pricing practices came from, but it didn't appear to come from a trial record.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "602", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I just return to the point about what the common ground is here? So you agree that the question of whether there is a valid delegation clause is one for the court?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The question of whether there is a -- under the severability principle, yes.\n\nJudge: You agree that courts make that decision by clear and convincing evidence?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think courts make that -- they -- they make that decision, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And you agree that there is a dispute here about whether there is a delegation of the arbitrability question to the arbitrator?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm sorry. We agree or disagree?\n\nJudge: I'm asking, do you agree with me that the dispute between you right now is about whether there is a delegation that will send, taking these two contracts together, send the dispute to arbitration on the arbitrability question?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think we agree that there is a -- I think both sides agree that there is a delegation clause and that, as originally formulated, it would cover this dispute. The opposing party says --\n\nJudge: Right, but -- but we're looking at two -- we're looking at two contracts. So you -- you agree -- let's finish this up very quickly. You agree that there's a dispute about whether there's a valid delegation clause that applies here to send it to the arbitrator?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Our position is that there is a valid delegation clause and it should be enforced.\n\nJudge: But the -- no. I'm sorry. Maybe I was unclear. But the question is, do you agree that there -- the question here is about the existence, the validity, of a delegation clause?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Absolutely, Your Honor. The -- the validity of the delegation clause, I think, is reserved for a court to resolve, applying the severability principle, which limits the arguments that can be --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- offered to undermine it.\n\nJudge: But you agree on those three questions, though?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Any change from when I said \"could remand\"? No? (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No change, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you, counsel. Counsel for the plaintiff?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'm going to abandon what I planned to talk about and try to answer the question that was raised earlier. Why are they fighting this so hard? And that only occurred to me within the last week or so.\n\nAnd the answer is there's a strategic reason. They want the Court -- they don't care who decides arbitrability. All they care about is how arbitrability gets decided because that's what goes to liability at the end of the day. And so the plan is we need the Supreme Court to overrule the Ninth Circuit's \"existence\" language.\n\nWhy do they need that and that only? The reason is that \"existence\" language originated from a case that was cited in our Ninth Circuit opinion. That case was somewhat similar to this case in that there was a preexisting agreement to arbitrate but then a subsequent, more specific agreement to litigate. The Ninth Circuit was looking at that situation and thinking: Shoot, we're bound to apply the old presumption in favor of arbitrability under federal law, but we know that as a matter of contract law, there was no real, mutual intent to arbitrate this dispute under the most recent, most specific agreement.\n\nSo they made up a new federal rule. Oh, this is a formation dispute, this is an existence dispute, so that they could avoid the presumption in -- in favor of arbitrability and do the right thing under state law.\n\nWe've gone to great pains to argue that non-preempted state laws are what apply here because, at the end of the day, those are the only laws that are capable of accurately discerning the parties' true intentions, no matter what type of contractual mess gets thrown in front of judges. It's impossible to make one federal rule, two federal rules, three federal rules that are going to accurately discern the parties' contractual intentions in -- in an infinite number of business situations. Traditional state law can do that.\n\nAnd we ask that the Court apply that here and welcome to answer any questions.\n\nJudge: But why wouldn't a later agreement that modifies the earlier contract simply go to what the scope of the agreement is?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So it goes to two scopes. It goes to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate the merits of the dispute, and our position that we've tried to brief very heavily is that it goes to the scope of the agreement to delegate this arbitrability dispute to the arbitrator.\n\nAnd our reason for doing that is that under prior rulings, consent to arbitrate is dispute-specific. If that's true in the context of an arbitration agreement, it also has to be true in the context of a delegation agreement.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "864", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice, do you have any further questions?\n\nJudge: Just a couple more questions possibly. I think you may have answered this indirectly, but I just want to be clear. Do you think that the reference to appropriations in the Constitution is equivalent to public money? Do you think appropriated funds are the same thing as \"public money\"?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that funds that Congress has given to an agency do qualify as public money, yes.\n\nJudge: What if someone—what if Congress set up an agency with substantial power but provided no method for that agency to obtain money other than private donations? Would that be consistent with the Appropriations Clause?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that likely would be consistent. You know, that obviously speaks to the question of source. And I think that Congress has chosen different sources over time, but I don't think there's anything in the text of the Constitution that limits Congress's ability to try to determine the ways it wants to structure those kinds of funding mechanisms.\n\nJudge: So suppose Congress said there are a lot of outside entities that have great interest in the work of the SEC, so we don't think we need to appropriate any money for the SEC. The SEC can simply rely on private donations and build up its own endowment, so to speak. Would that be constitutional?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that it likely would qualify as constitutional. Of course, if that created some kind of regulatory capture, I would expect that Congress would act to fix that, but, you know, there are examples throughout our history of scholarship funds, for example, that are administered by the federal government and originally funded by an endowment, and those, I think, qualify as appropriations.\n\nJudge: All set?\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Counsel, it might be a good sign or a bad sign, I don't know. Nobody's talked about remedy. Let me give you an opportunity to summarize your best argument why the Court below erred in its broad remedy of striking down basically not just this Payday Lending Rule but basically saying anything this agency has done since the beginning is invalid. So can you tell us how you deal with that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. The lower court recognized a sweeping retrospective remedy that we think conflicts with both severability principles and traditional remedial equitable principles in this space. Just first on severability, Dodd-Frank itself has an express severability clause. This Court emphasized that point in a previous ruling. And here, the lower court didn't even stop to consider whether any aspect of the agency's funding mechanism could be severed or would provide a basis to therefore limit the damage to Congress's work in trying to get this agency funded. I think that was an error and that there are several candidates for severability that would be a much less disruptive remedy in this context and would not entitle the opposing party to any relief because the Payday Lending Rule they challenge isn't traceable to those features or aspects of the funding mechanism.\n\nBut even if you followed the lower court’s approach and thought that there was something about this entire funding mechanism that’s invalid, even then I don’t think a retrospective remedy is warranted. The Court would be writing on a blank slate because no court had previously found that Congress itself violated the Appropriations Clause, but under traditional remedial equitable principles, it’s necessary to take into account the public interest and the balance of the equities. And here, a prospective remedy which would prevent the agency from enforcing this rule against the opposing party until it has a valid appropriation would give them a meaningful form of relief.\n\nInstead, the retrospective remedy that the court adopted is sweeping in its implications and would be profoundly disruptive. I would point in particular to the amicus brief that was filed by the Mortgage Bankers Association that explains how many entities in various industries have critically relied on the agency’s regulations, including, in particular, in the housing finance space. These regulations create safe harbors for lenders so that they will be deemed to be in compliance with statutory requirements on things like ability to pay and on disclosure requirements. And if the lower court is right and there’s the prospect that all of these actions should be unwound, it would create profound disruption in various economic markets that would hurt the regulated entities themselves.\n\nSo we think that provides powerful reason to reject that kind of retrospective relief and instead have a going-forward prospective remedy only.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "236", "dialogue": "Plaintiff’s Lawyer: But the claim itself, Your Honor, comes from the Fifth Amendment not just in Texas but in states nationwide.\nAnd I think this is an important point. Take Oregon, for example.\nOregon signed on to the state's amicus brief in support of Texas, but the reason that Oregon pays just compensation for takings under the Fifth Amendment is the Oregon courts, citing First English, have said it must pay just compensation.\nAnd so answering the Question Presented—\n\nJudge: If we don't read First English the way you do—I mean, I think that footnote's pretty difficult to decipher—do you lose?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor.\nI—I don't think it's just the footnote in First English.\nI think it's the broader holding that the remedy is required.\nBut I think there's no dispute here that there is an entitlement to relief.\nAnd, certainly, by the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, courts across the country had converged on how that kind of entitlement would be enforced.\nAnd it's enforced by a lawsuit directly against the entity that took the property that takes the form of saying, you have this duty to provide just compensation, you have not fulfilled it, and I'd like the court to order you to fulfill it.\n\nJudge: Can I have just a small point of information? Your case was dismissed in federal court.\nDid you ask for a remand on your claims under the Texas Constitution?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor.\nThe district court is keeping pendent jurisdiction over the claims under the Texas cause.\n\nJudge: So you—you have a pending suit on the state law claim?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, but there is a dispute about the scope of the takings law that governs that question.\nTexas has taken the position in the lower courts that the Texas Constitution has a narrower definition of what counts as a taking than the federal courts.\n\nJudge: Well, then First English comes in too because First English was about a state court claim and when it started, whether a temporary claim was a taking or not, and we said yes, it's a taking, and so the state court had to pay for that taking.\nHow is it different than First English in that respect?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I—I don't think it's different from First English, Your Honor, except that, here, it was removed into federal court and then the Fifth Amendment aspect of the case was dismissed on the merits.\n\nJudge: Oh, I—I—I don't disagree with you, but First English is about what the substantive law of Texas is and what Texas has to pay.\nAnd so that issue should be resolved even in the district court, correct?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I—I don't think so, Your Honor, because the backstop in First English is the Fifth Amendment that—that says that the met—the just compensation—\n\nJudge: No, the backstop in the Fifth—yes, it's the Fifth Amendment that provides the substantive law, but not necessarily—we didn't address whether it provides a cause of action.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I—I think the Court did, Your Honor.\nThe United States' amicus brief—\n\nJudge: All right.\nWe're—we're going to—we're going to go into—\n\nJudge: Can I just ask—I—I mean, this is similar to what [previous judge] was just getting into.\nAre you saying that we don't have three separate concepts—right, remedy, and cause of action?\nI thought those were three different things, and perhaps First English only covered two of them?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I—I'm not sure they're distinct concepts, Your Honor.\nI think the simplest way to understand cause of action is an entitlement to a particular remedy, which is why it's coherent to say someone might have a cause of action for an injunction.\n\nJudge: I thought it had to do with the forum, that you have a cause of action that is recognized in the judicial forum as opposed to, say, going to the legislature through—through private bills.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I—I think, to the extent that's the definition of \"cause of action,\" we would have a cause of action under the clear import of the history that the—\n\nJudge: Not—not the history.\nI guess I'm just trying to understand, is there—does it make sense to think about the Fifth Amendment as providing the right and the remedy but not speaking to where you're going to get that remedy from or what is the enforcement mechanism?\nThat's how I sort of am conceptualizing this, and—and I think we differ about that, so I'd like to hear your opinion on it.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I—I'm not sure that's a correct reading of the Fifth Amendment, Your Honor, in part because I think that reading—everyone agrees there are some judicial remedies for the Fifth Amendment.\nAs I understand my friend's argument, we'd be entitled to sue for injunctive relief or for ejectment in the absence of a—a path to a Fifth Amendment compensation remedy.\nSo everyone agrees there's some judicial remedy, and I think the form of that judicial remedy depends on the scope of the government's obligation.\nThere are two visions of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nOne is that the Fifth Amendment just provides a precondition.\nThe government is required to pay, and it can be enjoined from taking the property if it doesn't pay.\n\nThe other vision that's adopted in First English, that's reiterated in Knick, is that the Fifth Amendment creates an obligation to pay just compensation.\n\nAnd if that's the ongoing obligation—the government has taken property, it owes just compensation today, will owe just compensation tomorrow—courts are empowered to cure that ongoing obligation.\nIt's not a question of damages for a past violation.\nIt's a question of the government's obligation as it stands in court today.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "783", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the questions this morning make clear, this is an unusual case.\nAt the time we filed our brief, we flagged serious concerns about whether the case was moot. Now, as I take my friend to agree, it's clearly moot.\nWe have not only a plaintiff who no longer seeks to litigate her claims, a defendant who no longer owns the hotel, but also a website that is no longer lacking the relevant information. Rather than decide the more difficult standing question in this highly artificial posture, the Court should exercise its discretion to vacate the First Circuit's decision and dismiss the case as moot under Munsingwear. At a minimum, if the Court exercises its discretion to address standing, it should hold that Respondent lacks standing for a narrow reason.\nHer claim to standing depends on her view that Title III and the Reservation Rule give her a freestanding right to information, akin to the right to information about housing in Havens. But the ADA and the Reservation Rule are narrower.\nThey give individuals with disabilities a right to information in connection with the equal enjoyment of a hotel's reservation service. Because Ms. Laufer has not alleged that she would use that service in the future, she lacks standing. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge:\nYou're not saying that we don't have jurisdiction over the case as I understand you. You're simply saying that we should exercise our discretion not to decide the standing issue?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nThat's correct, Justice Thomas.\nWhen the government was on the receiving end of this type of a dismissal of a complaint in district court after the Court had granted certiorari in Carnahan, we specifically laid out our thoughts on this issue, specifically, that the Court does have discretion to decide either the standing or the mootness question first, but there, we said, you know, it makes sense, given the artificial nature of the case once the plaintiff has dismissed her claims, to decide mootness while leaving on the table, you know, the possibility that in a future case you might choose to decide standing. But I think for the reasons I was just explaining that this is not that future case because it's not just sort of artificial in the way that any case in which a plaintiff who has dismissed her claims will be artificial.\nIt's — it's sort of extra-artificial for the reasons that Justice Kagan was pointing out.\n\nJudge:\nYou're confident that the mootness question is easy. Is the government at all concerned about the manipulation of this Court's jurisdiction when you have — because Ms. Laufer, I gather, is not the only person doing this, bringing hundreds of cases around the country, and then, when the Court gets interested in her case, it's all gone. It's moot. It doesn't stop any of the other dozens of people, however many there are, who are doing the same thing.\nSo we may have to come up with another case as soon as this — this one, if it's — if it's not addressed, and then they will — that one will be mooted. And, you know, we can't sort of keep granting cert and having it constantly being mooted with never a determination of whether there's standing in those variety of cases. I mean, you may think that that's not necessarily easier or harder than the standing question, but it's certainly not one that we can just, you know, toss off with the back of our hand, is it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSo I certainly understand the institutional concern, and that is why, among other reasons, we think the — the Court can and should leave on the table this option of actually deciding the standing question rather than the mootness question in a future case should this actually become a pattern.\nI just think, again, that this is a particularly poor case to do it in. And I think, beyond that, you know, on the more specific question of whether this case will — or a case like this will come to the Court again, I think this has already been covered, but the circuit split actually looks quite different now than it did when the Court granted certiorari.\nIt's not just that the parties agree that under Munsingwear the First Circuit decision would have to be vacated in this case, but it's also that the Eleventh Circuit decision has since been vacated, and so now there's only one circuit decision on Petitioner's side — excuse me, Respondent's side of the split. And so I think parties may — may adjust their behavior in — in light of this, but, again, we, for the institutional reasons you note, think the Court can reserve this option in future cases.\n\nJudge:\nHow — reserve the option. How many times does this — do we have to do this? The next case that comes up in the same posture as this, should we let that one go too because maybe it'll be the last one, or should we address it here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSo I certainly understand the concern, Mr. Chief Justice. Again, you know, I think it's not just that this is the first case. It's really that this is sort of moot to the third.\nI mean, it has a plaintiff who has dismissed her claims, a defendant who no longer owns the hotel in question, and a website that everyone agrees has been updated. And if you look at the First Circuit's decision, the reason why the First Circuit thought this case was not moot was this third-party issue with respect to hotels.com and other third-party websites.\nBut, under the regulation, it's the hotel owner whose job it is to inform those third parties about accessibility information, and we don't even have that party before the Court to tell us — whether that has happened.\n\nJudge:\nI think — I think the Chief's question was, next time, we shouldn't do this, do you agree?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nYou know, I think certainly I would have to know more about what it looks like next time, but I think the whole point, obviously, of the Court reserving this ability would be — or recognizing this ability, really, because they're both jurisdictional questions, would be to allow you to say yes, we're going to go to standing in the next case.\n\nJudge:\nDo you think it's relevant that the reason the split looks different too is also perhaps strategic behavior on the part of the Respondent? Because didn't she go to those other circuits and then dismiss her claims and ask for the decisions to be vacated?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSo, you know, I don't want to sort of import — or impart a motive to any of the parties on — on either side of this case.\nI think the Eleventh Circuit decision is actually a little bit more complicated than that because it was actually that the defendant not only — or had not just sold the hotel at the time of the decision, it actually had dissolved and had not told the court that at the time, and so it wasn't sort of just on Ms. Laufer's side of the v.\n\nJudge:\nIt was at her request, is all I'm saying.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nI think it was at her request.\nYou know, again, I — I think the question really is, given how much more difficult at least we think the standing question is than the mootness question, whether it makes sense in this case, where we have these additional complications, to go ahead and decide that.\n\nJudge:\nI'm wondering, just to turn to the standing question —\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nCertainly.\n\nJudge:\n— how you would distinguish your position from Mr. Unikowsky's views and why it matters.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSure.\nSo I — I think there are sort of many differences, but I guess I'll hit three main ones. The first one is that Mr. Unikowsky, in his brief and then again this morning, expressed the view that the Reservation Rule is really about access to the facility under the ADA. We — we understand it a little bit differently.\nThere's, of course, some element of access to the facility in there, but the statute says —\n\nJudge:\nWhen you say \"the facility,\" meaning the hotel?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nThe hotel, the physical place of public accommodation.\nThe — the statute also guarantees people with disabilities the equal enjoyment of the services of a place of public accommodation, and so I think how this cashes out is that in — on Mr. Unikowsky's view, I think, if you have a hotel like this one that has no accessible — no accessible rooms, then a plaintiff can never have standing based on the fact that they didn't tell you that on their website because you couldn't go there anyway. We think that actually is an injury. If — if you're trying to figure it out and you can't because they don't have the information, you're not having the equal enjoyment of the service in the way that the ADA provides.\n\nJudge:\nIs your argument really a standing argument, an Article III argument, or is it a merits argument? You're saying that when Title III and the Reservation Rule are properly interpreted, then Ms. Laufer doesn't have a claim. That's a merits argument.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSo, Justice Alito, I appreciate that the — the analyses sort of overlap in this area, and I think the reason why that is so is that this Court has specifically recognized that congressional — what Congress does in terms of creating rights and causes of action is relevant. I think the — the phrase this Court used in TransUnion was, you know, due respect to obviously Havens, other cases.\nAnd so I do think there's some overlap.\nBut we do think the way this comes to the Court is that discrimination is an Article III injury when somebody personally experiences it with respect to her rights.\n\nJudge:\nWell, let — let me ask — let me give you a hypothetical of the sort that our former colleague, Justice Breyer, might have asked.\nSo — (Laughter.)\nLet's say I am — I am driving to a dog show and I am transporting my champion Saint Bernard and I want to check in to a hotel with my dog, and they ask me: Is it a service dog? I say no, it's not a service dog. Is it an emotional support dog? No, it's not an emotional support dog.\nWell, they say, you can't check into the hotel because either we don't allow dogs at all or we don't allow dogs that weigh more than a hundred pounds. And I say, well, you're violating the ADA.\nAnd I sue under the ADA. Now do I lack standing? Have I not suffered an injury in fact because I can't get this hotel room and I can't have my dog, my champion Saint Bernard, with me in my room? Or do I just lose because the dog isn't covered — having the dog without it being a service dog or an emotional support dog is not covered by the ADA?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nSo I think you might just have a merits problem there if I'm following it correctly, but I think it's a little bit different because the harm that you're alleging in that case is the — just the — the harm from — you know, maybe the person was mean to you, you just really wanted to bring your dog, whatever it is. I think the way that this case is pitched is that the right that — that Ms. Laufer claims gives her standing is the violation of the statutory right to information or the — the violation of the regulation.\nAnd so we sort of have to know what the statute or the regulation provide to decide whether she is — if I could just finish the — the sentence —\n\nJudge:\nSure.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\n— in an analogy to sort of an Allen versus Wright case, you know, we have to — we have to know whether she is the person who's personally experiencing the discrimination or she's the person who's sort of across the country hearing about it, and to know that, we have to know what the right to the non-discrimination right is.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "654", "dialogue": "Judge:\nAll right.\n\nSo here's the question here.\n\nWe -- the question, I guess, in response to that answer is: Why wouldn't it be reasonable for a jury to interpret the submission of the invoice to be the kind of specific question that would -- that would require him to provide an answer? I mean, we don't have a particular question.\n\nWe have his interpretation of the question and then answering it in a certain way, which you say doesn't make it false.\n\nBut, in the context of what a reasonable jury could have determined, I don't understand why -- what your argument is to why a jury couldn't have interpreted what happened here to be calling for a specific response to the question how much do you owe.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I think it's -- it -- it -- it's difficult to conceive of an assertion in an invoice as being a specific -- specific numerical --\n\nJudge:\nDifficult, but impossible? The question is: Could a reasonable jury have interpreted it that way?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI -- I don't think so, Your Honor, and the reason is, among others, that there wasn't a -- there wasn't a question posed at all.\n\nThe witnesses testified that it had -- that he was -- or the evidence showed that he was talking about his personal note, not the total amount that he owed.\n\nAnd the government conceded that what he said was, and I quote, \"literally true\" --\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- \"but not the whole story.\"\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1014 prohibits any false statement.\n\nAnd like any other collection of words, a statement is false if it conveys an untrue message to the listener in context, even if the precise words used, considered in a vacuum, could possibly carry another meaning.\n\nSo, here, when, in response to receiving an invoice telling Defendant that he owed the FDIC $269,000, Defendant then told the FDIC's agents that he was shocked by the letter, had no idea where the 269 number comes from, and had borrowed $110,000, he made a false statement because he clearly conveyed the message that he did not owe the higher amount.\n\nAnd 12 members of the jury in this case, who were not given a specialized definition of what \"false\" means and, therefore, must have applied the concept as ordinarily understood, agreed.\n\nIndeed, on page 7 of his reply brief, Defendant himself agrees that context obviously matters in determining whether a statement is false.\n\nI understood my friend to reiterate that position again today.\n\nSo now it appears we're just debating what context the jury may consider as a matter of law.\n\nAnd to the extent Defendant is arguing that you can only take account of the immediately preceding question, we urge the Court to reject any such rule.\n\nThe jury should assess a speaker's meaning the same way the original listener would have: in light of other parts of the conversation and other circumstances that naturally bear on meaning.\n\nOur position in this case is not that \"false\" encompasses anything that might be characterized as misleading or any failure to disclose pertinent information.\n\nIt is that a statement is untrue if it states only a portion of the truth on the subject it addresses in a context where the statement would be taken as both accurate and complete.\n\nIf, like Defendant, the speaker knowingly conveys that untrue message and does it with a specific intent to influence the FDIC to not fully collect on its debt, that violates the statute. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge:\nSo it doesn't really matter in this case whether there is a difference between \"false\" and \"misleading?\"\n\nPlaintiff:\nOur position in this case is that Defendant's statements were false.\n\nThat's how the jury was instructed. Our position is just that you assess the falsity of something, you know, the inaccuracy of it, by looking to context and what -- whether a false message was imparted.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk, though, today about what kind of rule the Seventh Circuit applied in this case, and I -- I think the crux of the Seventh Circuit's analysis completely aligns with what I just said.\n\nI think you can see this in particular at pages 10a and 13a of the petition appendix.\n\nOn 10a, the Court said: Even if he never used the precise words, the implication of Defendant's statements was that he owed Washington Federal no more than $110,000, something that was untrue.\n\nAnd then, on 13a, the court talks about the mistake -- unmistakable impression left by his statements and how the jury found in its verdict that he conveyed the message that he falsely stated that he only owed $110,000, and any higher amount was incorrect.\n\nJudge:\nSo -- but, in -- in general, do you think there's any difference between the statutes that say \"false statement\" and the statutes that say \"false and misleading?\" Because it sounds to me that your -- would argue that when it says \"false,\" that includes misleading statements in context.\n\nSo is there any difference?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWe are not taking the position that the word \"misleading\" does no work in statutes in which it appears.\n\nWe are -- we think there is some overlap between these concepts, as I understood my friend to agree.\n\nBut, when we say something has to be false in context, we mean it has to state -- the statement itself has to state a -- a false message, it has to convey a false meaning directly, not lead the listener down a path perhaps to a foreseeable conclusion that additional information might have obviated.\n\nBut, here, when Defendant says \"I borrowed $110,000\" in response to what was essentially a question from the FDIC saying, did you -- do you owe $269,000, that is directly conveying through his statement that he only owed that amount.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1029", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Kneedler, I just want to clarify something. So your position in response to, say, the rogue state hypothetical, when you said an injunction is the solution, it's not an injunction to pay money because you said the United States thinks that can't happen. So is it your position that if, say, a state or the United States takes property, refuses to give just compensation for it, that the property owner could get an injunction essentially saying, give me my property back if you're not going to pay, and perhaps get that injunction but not get reimbursed for the temporary taking that happened in between the seizure and the award of the injunction?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct. And the same thing would be true, there could be a temporary deprivation of due process, and if you get an injunction preventing the government from doing whatever it did without due process, there is an interim period, but a person can go to court, get a TRO, get a preliminary injunction to prevent that from going on a long time. That's just the nature of litigation and an injunction, but it doesn't lead to the question of damages. And this Court's cases, First English and others, had to do with the calculation of whether interest should be paid, and that's what the Court meant about the Fifth Amendment being a basis for the award of compensation, not that there was a cause of action.\n\nJudge: Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: And just to clarify from what was just said, the government's position would be that you might be able to have a cause of action, say, under state law or whatnot for that temporary taking. It's not that you would be out the compensation entirely, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. That would depend on state law and the availability of a state cause of action on that. But I'm only talking about the federal causes of action, where there's no basis for an award of money out of the Treasury and overcoming sovereign immunity in federal court for compensation even for that interim period. But the interim period is endemic to litigation, due process violation being held on an indictment, but that is the proper remedy and that's the remedy that existed until the Tucker Act was passed. It was the remedy that this Court said in Knick was the way to vindicate Fifth Amendment rights until the Tucker Act or state constitutions came along and provided a monetary remedy.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Rebuttal, Mr. McNamara.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor. To begin with Justice Gorsuch's question, I think it's important to remember the procedural posture here. I understood my friend from Texas to say that the City of Baytown decision means that Texas courts hear claims under the federal Constitution. The complaint pleads a claim under the federal Constitution, and to the extent Texas's only complaint with that was that it failed to cite directly to a Texas Supreme Court decision, it's not clear why Texas moved to dismiss it, sought an interlocutory appeal of that decision as a dispositive issue, and then extinguished it on the merits in the Fifth Circuit. To the extent that claim exists, that claim has been extinguished and that warrants reversal.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: To the original meaning, and I think, Your Honor, the rogue state example is not a hypothetical. It's a real example because state after state has looked to federal law and to First English as the thing that prevents the state from denying compensation. That's true in Oregon, as I mentioned, but also New Mexico, South Carolina, Nebraska—the list goes on of states that provide compensation under the Fifth Amendment because they understand the Fifth Amendment to require compensation. And they're correct to understand that, Your Honor.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The original understanding, as evidenced by writings from James Madison to St. George Tucker, is that the Fifth Amendment creates an obligation to pay, which is why you can sue under the Tucker Act because the Fifth Amendment creates an obligation to pay. Only in the absence of a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce that obligation do the federal courts resort to cases like Meigs v. McClung's Lessee, where the Court ejected the United States military from its own base because it didn't have clean title. That is the last resort in the absence of a court that has the jurisdiction to enforce that obligation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's why, in Maine Community Health, this Court specifically pointed to the Takings Clause as the analogy for what sort of money-mandating inquiry it means to create the obligation to pay. But, more broadly, Your Honor, I think Texas's understanding of the Fifth Amendment would relegate property rights to the status of the poor relation of the Bill of Rights. It would be the only acknowledged ongoing obligation in the Constitution that is entitled to no enforcement, that is left entirely to the discretion of the government entities that are supposedly obligated to pay. But, surely, as evidenced by the writings and by the adoption of the Fifth Amendment itself, the Framers meant for property rights to mean more than that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: If the Court has no further questions, we'll rest on our briefs.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently available information.\n\nJudge: Well, the Respondent was also concerned about the propriety of the procedures that were used to put him on the list to begin with and challenged that. So how does the declaration that you all used, how does that change the procedures that he thought were violative of his rights?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So two responses. As far as a procedural challenge goes, number one, for the post-deprivation procedures, those have actually already changed since the time he was first on the list. I take the point that maybe he wants some pre-deprivation procedures. Those haven't changed. But I think a prior case pretty squarely forecloses that challenge.\n\nJudge: But how would we know, for example, and how would he know that you have not -- that any circumstances or any procedures are different if he's put on the list in the future when we don't know the procedures or the circumstances that got him on the list?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah. So -- so that's the key. He does know why he's on the list, and we've -- we've made this public, which is the standard to be on the No Fly List, in addition to reasonable suspicion that you're a known or suspected terrorist, is also you must pose a threat of conducting or engaging in one of four enumerated acts of terrorism, international terrorism or domestic terrorism or a violent act of terrorism.\n\nJudge: But doesn't that depend on him knowing what might put him back on? Because, if you're assessing whether it is reasonably likely to recur and you don't know what it is that could put you back on, it's a little hard to even make the assessment.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I want to push back on the fact that he needs to know what it is. Even if his claim is that our placement of him at time one was unlawful for whatever reason, procedural or substantive, the question for mootness purposes is whether he could be expected to be placed back on the list at a future time.\n\nJudge: But what -- let me just stop you there. The way this works is not just doing something illegal. It's an email. It's a meeting with someone. It's something that only in combination with all the other \"connect the dots\" post-9/11 concerns looks more suspicious and gets you on the list.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: You're exactly right. It is always based on a totality of information. It is never -- you know, it's almost never going to be one single thing. And categorically, we have filed declarations in this and certainly in other cases saying it's never on the basis of First Amendment protected activity.\n\nJudge: Are you saying that's unlikely?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's a very rare thing. There are very, very, very few U.S. persons on the No Fly List who satisfy that criteria. It's exceedingly rare. And I take the point that he satisfied it in the past and we continue to believe he satisfied it in the past.\n\nJudge: Right. I mean, he was in a prison in UAE for months, right? I mean, that's not a usual circumstance of a U.S. person.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And for Article III purposes, I think this Court has always been reluctant to rely on past instances in order to --\n\nJudge: But this is not sort of a general Article III issue. Was that a mootness case?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It was a standing case.\n\nJudge: All right.

{"id": "701", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: So my friend pointed out that at the time the APA and Section 2401(a) were adopted, there were other statutes dealing with administrative review provisions, and those statutes ran from the time of agency action. If you look at 21 U.S.C. 37—or 371.\n\nJudge: Okay. I got it. I got it. And just flipping back to the question that we had earlier with your friend on the other side, if we were to interpret the word \"accrue\" to mean the moment of the agency's action, what's the consequence for as-applied challenges? Put aside, again, enforcement because that's, you know, in a criminal proceeding or an enforcement proceeding. Here, it's an APA challenge, and there's no distinction in the statutory text between as-applied and facial challenges. And I understand courts of appeals for years have said as-applied challenges may proceed without carefully looking at the word \"accrue\" either.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the difference is which action is being challenged. The reason you can raise a challenge in the as-applied context is that the final agency action that you're challenging is the agency action actually applying the regulation. And so you're bringing your challenge less than six years after the final agency action occurred. What you can't do is go back and challenge a regulation that was adopted decades ago.\n\nJudge: I—I—\n\nJudge: Counsel, may I ask, what is the coverage of this provision? In other words, you've noted that there are many statutes that deal with particular kinds of agency action. So what's left over other than this regulation? What's the world of things that this decision will matter to? Is it small, is it medium-sized, is it large? What's in it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think it is relatively large in the sense that a general APA cause of action applies to a broad range of government claims. I’m not—I don't know exactly how to quantify that, but I think it is true that—\n\nJudge: But what kinds of claims? From what kind of agencies? What is not—what are we—what is not at issue here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I can't give you a precise answer on that. I mean, I—I can point you to the special statutory review provisions that we've identified in footnote 4 of our brief. Candidly, we got to a page-long footnote and stopped, so there are a lot of other special statutory review provisions that all use \"accrual\" in exactly the same way. I mean, I think looking at a survey of this Court's cases and thinking about how often the Court encounters challenges in the context of an APA claim indicates that it's a pretty broad category of cases, but I don't have sort of precise contours I can draw.\n\nJudge: But how much will it matter kind of in the real world? Because when you have a regulation that has some defects, it's probably going to be challenged sooner rather than later by someone. And then, if it's held invalid, it usually will get to this Court, which will provide, you know, a final answer on that question. So coming in more than six years later is not typically a winning strategy for challenging a rule. So just kind of real-world implications, picking up on the other question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think one of the real-world implications to highlight is that this doesn't just apply in the context of regulations. I mean, their rule would apply in the context of a permit issued to operate a dam. And on their theory, someone who travels out west for the first time to go see the snail darter can say, I've never been here before, I've never been affected by this dam, and so I'm going to mount an APA challenge to that permit that was issued 20 years ago to allow the dam to continue operating. I think that type of application extrapolated across the entire federal government and all of the final agency actions that the government engages in outside of the context of rulemaking—it's pretty hard to overstate the significance of allowing those challenges to be brought more than six years later.\n\nJudge: And then thinking about what Congress was getting at here, I'm not sure it was really getting at this issue at all because six years is an extremely long time to begin with to challenge a regulation. So, I mean, I don't—I don't know that they were thinking about this context. We just have to apply the text as it is, but I—I'm—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I think I agree with you in the sense that 2401(a) is a catch-all statute of limitations. Congress adopted it as a backstop. It erred on the side of caution in setting a lengthy six-year term. But, in understanding how to apply that catch-all statute of limitations to particular types of claims, I think the way to show fidelity to Congress's intent and Congress's expectations is to look at how Congress has approached accrual when it's dealt with similar claims of the same type.\n\nJudge: But—but Congress could easily—this is an obvious point, but Congress could easily do that across the board for agency actions and certainly would do something shorter than six years if it did because repose has been thrown around here. Six years doesn't give you much repose to begin with if you're the government, at least unless this Court has ruled on the issue.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I—I mean, I think, of course, six years is better than six decades, which—I mean, that's not even a limit on my friend's rule. So I do think that six years meaningfully protects repose interests. And that lengthy term accounts, again, for the fact that this covers a broad range of claims. Even outside the administrative law context, I mean, there are any number of other types of claims that are subject to Section 2401.\n\nJudge: Right. Okay. One other question, on a petition for rulemaking that you mentioned, would you acknowledge that the standard of judicial review for the denial of that would be not the same as in a direct challenge to the rule?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, I think that's right.\n\nJudge: And that's the problem.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: One would—one from my position would say that's what Congress has chosen.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And to say that because Congress has chosen a petition for rulemaking process that is deferential, the Court should instead allow challenges to things that happened decades ago—I don't think that really follows. And I do think that this case is a good illustration of the odd fit that this sort of claim is in a context brought a decade after. If you look at the complaint, it's full of references to, you know, cost data from 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019. But all of that data is completely irrelevant if they're right that they can go forward on a challenge to the rule as it was adopted in 2011. It makes far more sense to handle this kind of challenge in the context of a petition for rulemaking, where the agency can actually take account of experience with the rule and decide what makes sense going forward.\n\nJudge: Well, that just—\n\nJudge: Counsel—\n\nJudge: —suggests that the claim would fail on the merits, right? It doesn't go to the issue of accrual.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I—I—so my point is not that the claim would fail. I mean, they—they have other arguments about the law. We—we think those arguments would fail too. But my point about the intervening information is that they have thought that information is relevant to showing something about this rule, and yet, in the procedural mechanism they are using here, that information is completely irrelevant. That suggests that maybe it's not the right procedural mechanism.\n\nJudge: When—when I read your brief in opposition, I came away with the impression that this case would not have a broad practical effect. You say on page 11 that it's a relatively uncommon circumstance for a person who was not injured when the rule was promulgated to become injured at a later date. But then I got a very different message from your brief on the merits when you say that accrual—the Petitioner's approach to accrual under 2401(a) would substantially expand the class of potential challengers and thereby increase the burdens on agencies and courts. So what accounts for this different message?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it's a difference in focus. At the cert stage, the point we were making was—\n\nJudge: That we shouldn't take the case because it wasn't a big deal. But after we took it—(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Our point was that there aren't a lot of plaintiffs in Petitioner's position as compared to plaintiffs who can bring the challenge.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "744", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff: I certainly understand that intuition, and if the Court thought that it were prudent to simply try to rule narrowly here and not dictate broader First Amendment principles, we have no problem with the Court assuming that heightened scrutiny applies.\n\nWe think the law easily satisfies it. We do think that intermediate scrutiny is a more appropriate framework for this kind of law that's not directly targeting protected speech. But, in any event, there's a compelling national security interest here, and the law isn't just narrowly tailored; it's precisely tailored.\n\nIt's trying to fix the thing that's creating the problem, which is the PRC's involvement and the Chinese government's ability to exercise this control over the corporate entities.\n\nJudge: How are we supposed to think about the two different rationales here and how they interact, the data collection rationale, which seems to me at least very strong; the covert content manipulation rationale, as the hypotheticals have illustrated, raise much more challenging questions for you about how far that goes.\n\nAnd if that alone -- if you didn't have the data collection piece, you only had the covert content manipulation piece, and then the point that Congress would not have enacted this just based on the data collection rationale alone, just your understanding of how the two arguments fit together.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Sure.\n\nAnd -- and let me walk through our defense of the data protection rationale and why we think it's a full justification for this law and the Court could stop there and then be responsive to their arguments that somehow the interest in preventing covert manipulation somehow taints it.\n\nSo just on data protection, I think that it should be beyond dispute that, of course, our nation has an enormous interest in keeping the sensitive data out of the hands of our foreign adversary.\n\nAnd it should also be beyond dispute that our foreign adversary has an existing capability through its laws and through the way that these companies are integrated to get its hands on that data.\n\nThere is no question that Congress was sincerely motivated by that concern.\n\nThere's a whole lead-up to the statute here where the executive branch across two different presidential administrations was expressing concerns about the data problems.\n\nCongress was extensively briefed on those problems.\n\nIt passed a companion data protection statute at the same time that was intended to prevent selling data to foreign adversary nations.\n\nThe statute is shot-through with protections that I think are key to this concern about closing off the vulnerability of access to the data.\n\nSo that's a sincere justification for Congress's desire here to act.\n\nWe think it's a compelling interest and it's narrowly tailored.\n\nThen you get to the question of what to do about the fact that there's also this interest in covert content manipulation.\n\nAnd in the First Amendment context, this Court in cases like Heffron has made clear that once you have a justification that satisfies the First Amendment, you don't need to go further and look at other justifications to decide whether they would independently satisfy First Amendment scrutiny.\n\nSo I think it's not necessary for the Court to go on and probe whether it thinks that covert content manipulation itself independently justifies the law.\n\nNow my friends say that's all fine and good, but they think covert content manipulation is just per se illegitimate.\n\nAnd I honestly don't understand how that argument could carry the day because just imagine if Congress passed a law that said the PRC can't covertly manipulate TikTok.\n\nObviously, that law's not going to violate any constitutional principle.\n\nIt's a laudable goal, I think, for our legislature to protect us from foreign adversary interference like that.\n\nAnd so there's nothing something -- there's nothing that's inherently impermissible about wanting to guard against that risk.\n\nMaybe you could say that it sweeps in too much protected speech in the way it's operationalized in the Act here, but there's certainly no fundamental taint -- taint or anything akin to racial discrimination to call into question whether Congress could seek to vindicate that as one of many interests.\n\nSo I guess, to just kind of bring it all together, what I would say to the Court is they have basically acknowledged that data protection is a compelling interest.\n\nThat was Congress's real interest.\n\nIt provides a sufficient basis on its own to uphold this law. The Court could say just that and -- and affirm.\n\nJudge: I don't know how we do that unless we accept your argument that the post-divestiture provision that stops them from conferring on the algorithm is not a speech impediment, meaning it -- it's very hard for me to say that it's not motivate -- to decide that question, that it is a speech impediment and one that on its face itself has to be analyzed separately from the data.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, Justice, let me begin by saying again that we do think that an interest in preventing any operational agreement between the U.S. subsidiary and ByteDance, which is the relevant provision you're talking about, is justified by data protection alone.\n\nAnd that includes with respect to cooperation on a content recommendation algorithm specifically because of the concern that it necessitates data flows between the companies.\n\nSo I think that as a factual matter, that could justify Congress enacting --\n\nJudge: So, if it's --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But, to the extent that you think that actually the prohibition on coordinating with respect to an algorithm reflects some kind of impermissible content-based problem with the statute, the statute has a severability clause.\n\nAnd I certainly don't think that it would give the Court a basis to invalidate this law or to -- or to stop it from operating with respect to all of the provisions that operate to protect data security.\n\nAt most, it would suggest that that little piece of the law has to be on its own severed from the rest of how the statute operates.\n\nJudge: How does that affect whether we would apply -- because, assuming it's data protection, then I would think that strict scrutiny wouldn't necessarily apply.\n\nI could understand applying intermediate scrutiny.\n\nBut how do we do that with respect to this part, the algorithm issue? How do we get to intermediate scrutiny with respect to that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The way you get to intermediate scrutiny there is to recognize that prohibiting foreign adversary control over the operations of the platform, including with respect to the fundamental backbone of the system, is not based on any protected speech or -- or content-based in the relevant sense...", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "309", "dialogue": "Judge: Why -- why not?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because, there, you would have to confront a very different question, whether a foreign government that was speaking in the United States has First Amendment rights.\n\nAnd I don't know that the Court has ever addressed that.\n\nBut, here, we've got a U.S. company --\n\nJudge: No, I understand that. I just want to see where you draw the line.\n\nSo it's true, the Court has never held that a foreign government has free speech rights.\n\nAnd if we were to hold that, I would think it's because -- it would be because speech by a foreign government, particularly one with enormous resources, is not protected -- allowing that is -- does not serve the underlying interests of the First Amendment, which are, among other things, fostering democratic self-government and furthering the -- the truth -- the search for truth.\n\nSo let's assume that that's -- we start with that, all right? What if TikTok were then not owned by the foreign government, but it was undisputed that TikTok was totally controlled by the foreign government, could not do one thing without the approval of the foreign government? That's different?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I do think that it is different, Your Honor.\n\nFor example, you know, I -- I've given the hypothetical that I've given, but there are a lot of companies in this country that have foreign owners, not just companies like Politico, with -- which is German-owned, or Al Jazeera, which is partly owned by the government of Qatar.\n\nJudge: Well, I -- I understand that, but what would be the reason for drawing that line?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\n\nBecause --\n\nJudge: If -- if there's a good reason for saying that a foreign government, particularly an adversary, does not have free speech rights in the United States, why would it all change if it was simply hidden under some kind of contrived core -- corporate structure?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because it is a U.S. speaker.\n\nI'll give you another example.\n\nAMC movie theaters used to be owned by a Chinese company.\n\nUnder this theory, Congress could order AMC movie theaters to censor any movies that Congress doesn't like or promote any movies that Congress wanted.\n\nAnd I think the reason is that, here, where it's conceded you actually have a bona fide U.S. company, it is not simply a Chinese cutout that is the Chinese government speaking itself --\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- but an independent United States company.\n\nJudge: Let's say this is not a complete --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- but an independent United States company.\n\nJudge: Let's say this is not a complete answer to -- to your First Amendment argument, but would you be willing to concede that this is a very important factor that should be taken into account in deciding whether there's a First Amendment violation?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, Your Honor, I think that it does help supply a compelling governmental interest, but I still think you have to march through the strict scrutiny analysis and analyze their interests.\n\nI do not think that they have a compelling governmental interest in -- in -- in the manipulation of content.\n\nI think that is in the teeth of the First Amendment.\n\nAnd if you look at the government's brief and the rest of the record in this case, that's really what it's focused on. Their complaint is the fear that the content could be critical of the United States Government or -- or could undermine our democracy.\n\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Mr. Francisco, I just wanted to follow up on -- on that line of questioning with just some fact questions --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: -- because it seems to me there are a couple of things that the parties still dispute about facts in this Court, which is a little unusual.\n\nThe government says that TikTok U.S. has no authority or ability to alter the algorithm or recommendation engine but must simply follow ByteDance's directives.\n\nYou disagree with that in your reply brief.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, we do.\n\nJudge: Somebody has to be right and somebody has to be wrong about that. What's -- what's the fact -- what does the record show on that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, Your Honor, we are here on a record, and there is nothing in the record that says that TikTok, like any other subsidiary, doesn't have its own independent-making authority.\n\nIf you look at their record cites, what they point to is the ordinary types of control that a parent company has over a subsidiary company.\n\nBut it doesn't change the fact that --\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nWhat is the fact? Are you prepared to make a -- a representation of the fact here?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nThe fact is that TikTok, Incorporated, as a U.S. company, does have a choice over the algorithm. Now it would be an incredibly bad business decision for them to abandon this algorithm, and they very doubtful would ever do it, but they have that authority.\n\nWhat they clearly have the authority to do is shut down the platform in the face of Chinese pressure.\n\nThat's actually what they agreed to do in the national security agreement. I think that underscores why TikTok, Incorporated, as a U.S. company, does have its own set of First Amendment rights.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nAnd then another fact question.\n\nBefore the D.C. Circuit, you -- you argued that the Chinese government has made clear in public statements that it would not permit a forced divest -- divestment of the recommendation engine.\n\nDoes that mean that some key component of the recommendation engine is under Chinese control?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, Your Honor.\n\nWhat it means -- and this might warrant a little more explanation.\n\nWhat it means is that there are lots of parts of the source code that are embodied in intellectual property that are owned by the Chinese government, and they would restrict, like the United States restricts, the sale of those types of things to foreign governments.\n\nIt doesn't alter the fact that this is being operated in the United States by TikTok, Incorporated.\n\nSo --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nI -- I got it.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay.\n\nJudge: I got it.\n\nAnd then you represent that the divestiture is not feasible within the Act's timeframe.\n\nI'm sorry for these fact questions --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "673", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, [Barker] has factors too. I mean, is there some evidence that Barker's factors are more predictable or lead to results that are more consistent in some way than Mathews?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor, it's more fact-sensitive. And that's the -- my friend would see that as a drawback. I think that's actually a merit of Barker.\n\nJudge: More fact-sensitive than the factors in Mathews?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. Petitioners' counsel said just a few moments ago that Mathews allows you to do these categorical projections into what the typical case is going to look like in the future so that trial judges can be told, make sure you have a hearing within 14 days no matter what the facts show you.\nAnd we don't think that's very flexible at all. We would prefer a test that allows trial judges to be trial judges and weigh the cases as they come.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you're saying even though your argument is that both Barker and Mathews come out the same way here, somehow, in application, Mathews is deficient vis-à-vis Barker? Barker is the better, easier way to—what—what is better about it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Again, it's fact-sensitive. No two property cases are going—movable property cases in the forfeiture context are going to be alike. You have lots of different types of property. Even the same type of property can have different values, different claimants.\n\nJudge: And I thought that was what Mathews allowed for. But you're saying that's—in your view, that's what Barker is.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The way Mathews has been applied in the Sixth Circuit and the Second Circuit has been to really alter the Rules of Civil Procedure for every case going forward, whether it's a case where the claimant would have defaulted anyway or whether—\n\nJudge: I'm not talking about how it's been applied, letting judges be judges. I'm talking about the test itself. Are there—is there something about the factors in the Barker test that is more—more determinative, allows us to be more predictable about what's going to happen, other than, I guess, the view that you'll never get any other process? If that's—if that's the result that you think Barker always points to, then I guess it is more consistent than Mathews, but—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, and I think it's—a little more specific in describing the government interests. The government has to explain why there is a delay. And then you're looking at the key factor, which is how long has this taken?\n\nJudge: All right. So just—finally, getting back to [another judge’s] point, is it your argument that plaintiffs are not allowed in this context, by that I mean the civil forfeiture context generally, to assert that the forfeiture procedures themselves are deficient? Not making a delay claim. I'm conceding, says the plaintiff, that this was not—that the forfeiture hearing is going to happen or has happened in a timely fashion. But I would like to complain about the procedures that were given to me in that context.\nIs it your view that—that no such claim can be made?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, if the claim, for example, was that the judge who's sitting over my case is biased against me—\n\nJudge: No, not that claim. I—I don't want to make it a kangaroo court because that's hard and it will go back to the question that [another judge] asked.\nI want to make it something else about the process that is unfair. You know, these involve, as another judge says, people who are—say that they're innocent owners, that they own the property, and that they knew nothing about the drugs.\nSo the state has a system—this is a hypothetical I'm making up on the spot. The state has a system in which the manner of proving that the person, you know, knows about the drugs is very unfair. You know, the state says we presume that if you are—you know, know this individual, then you're aware of their drug activity. And since this person is your son, you obviously know them. You can't bring in any evidence that shows that you didn't know anything about it. You're not an innocent owner under that test.\nAnd what the person, the—the owner, would like to do is say that you can't have a system—you can't have a method of proof that is so unfair in terms of my ability to prove that I didn't know what was going on.\nThat's my challenge, not that the hearing took too long. It has nothing to do with speed. I want to make that kind of challenge.\nMy question is, is it your view that no such claims exist? And if they do exist, are we judging the due process by the Barker test or some other test in that situation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I think this Court's decision in District Attorney’s Office v. Osborne would suggest that if you've created a new procedural right then, yes, there's some due process protections that attach, but the state has a tremendous amount of discretion in terms of what processes are going to attach to that new—\n\nJudge: Understood. So—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —procedural right.\n\nJudge: —if you agree that the person could make such a claim, are you saying the Barker test would apply in that situation to determine the—the ultimate due process question?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It doesn't sound like that's a timing issue, so probably not, Your Honor, but, again, in—in this case, the issue is they've had my car too long.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And that's a timing question.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nChief Judge: Thank you, counsel. Next speaker.\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI think it may be helpful for me to lay out how the federal government sees this case. In our view, the Court has already found, as indicated in $8,850 and Von Neumann, that the only process a claimant is entitled to after personal property is seized is a timely final forfeiture hearing.\nIf this Court is of the view that it has not yet addressed that issue, it should now. And it should hold that a claimant has no right to an interim post-seizure hearing.\nHistory and tradition support that rule. At the time of the founding, there was no right to an early hearing when property was seized. Only a timely forfeiture hearing was required. That approach has prevailed for nearly 250 years.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "49", "dialogue": "Judge: So you brought a straight-up malicious prosecution claim under the common law in Count 1, your client did.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: Also brought this Fourth Amendment hybrid thing in Count 3, I think it was, and got removed to federal court.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: I don't understand why. Malicious prosecution in state law is a pretty easy tort to prove. Not always, but you might have had a really good shot and got punitive damages and your attorney's fees and everything. Why are we making a federal case out of this?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, again, setting aside this Court's recent cases saying we're entitled to do that—\n\nJudge: I'm not questioning them. I'm not questioning them.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: I'm just asking purely strategically. I've struggled to understand why some of these cases wind up in federal court when, as an old plaintiffs' lawyer, I might have wanted to bring them in front of a state court.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: To keep them in state court?\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So there's a couple of reasons just speaking at a high level of generality. Many states don't allow malicious prosecution against law enforcement, so, like, California doesn't allow that. In many states, there's a heightened mens rea. So, in the Sixth Circuit, the mens rea for the federal malicious prosecution tort is lower than for the state malicious prosecution tort.\n\nJudge: Can you tell me a little bit about that? What is that split?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I can tell you the precise split, which is that the Fourth, Sixth, and D.C. Circuits say that the mens rea element is purely objective. Other circuits have imposed some sort of malice or heightened requirement.\n\nJudge: An objective mens rea, okay. Got it. And did you have anything else you wanted to add? I'm sorry. I interrupted you.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: All I wanted to say on that front is just that, you know, it was our right to bring the Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution case. And that's not just from Thompson and Manuel where I understand that Your Honor disagrees, but dating back to Gerstein and County of Riverside from the '80s and '90s, saying, and Justice Scalia explains it, that, you know, the idea of a reasonable seizure at the time of the founding, what the Framers anticipated was arrest someone, you bring them before the magistrate right away, that's what constitutes a reasonable seizure. So this is a matter of what is a reasonable seizure, not just as a function of the due process clause.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I'd like to address Justice Alito's and Justice Jackson's questions about what exactly everyone is fighting about here today. I think the main disagreement is about how far the Court ought to go in its opinion and what issues it should decide. I understood Petitioner to be saying that the Court should say simply that it is possible to bring a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim even when a valid charge is accompanied by a baseless charge and to stop there. We think it's important for the Court to take one step further and to say that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the baseless charge caused an unreasonable seizure. That's an important step to take because if there's no unreasonable seizure, there's no violation of the Fourth Amendment. But it's also not a significant step to take because you'd just be reaffirming what you've already said in Thompson. Now, I understand Respondents asked the Court to take one step further still and to determine that the seizure in this particular case was reasonable. But we don't think the Court should reach that question because it hasn't been the focus of the briefing and wasn't passed on below. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Would your formulation leave open the Eleventh Circuit rationale?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, it would leave open the Eleventh Circuit rationale.\n\nJudge: But she fought you—she fought on that. And she may in reply explain—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: But why do you think she fought it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We think that the Eleventh Circuit—\n\nJudge: It's an unfair question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We think the Eleventh Circuit rationale makes sense in the context where there is an uncharged crime for which there was probable cause. And the police officer wants to defend manufacturing the crime that was charged on the ground that there was also this uncharged crime. We don't think the Eleventh Circuit rationale makes sense in the context where there are multiple charges on which the magistrate did pass and it turns out there was no probable cause for one of them.

{"id": "736", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: So I think the Court could say that we haven't decided whether there's ever any entitlement to an interim hearing, but assuming that there could be such a requirement in some category of cases, it clearly would not—Petitioners were not entitled to that sort of hearing in this particular case.\n\nNow, there may be some dangers in kicking it down the road. I think there will be other petitions coming up because of the Sixth Circuit's decision and even coming out of Krimstock. But the Court definitely could save this for another day if the Court wanted to.\n\nJudge: I—I thought you were going to say that we could say that there's no due process right to an interim hearing, period, but there could be other due process issues related to other aspects of forfeiture proceedings, and you don't need to rule those problems out by saying there's no due process right to an interim hearing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's certainly our preferred rule. I think I was assuming that another Judge wanted a much more limited rule that just dealt with the facts of this case. But as I said in my opening, we certainly think that the Court has already indicated that there's no—\n\nJudge: So what do you—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —due process right to—\n\nJudge: —see Barker being, if it's not an interim hearing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I—\n\nJudge: I mean, Barker, a petitioner comes in, makes a motion and says I'm entitled to a Barker hearing. The government claims its interests, but I have hardship. And I want a hearing on the level of my hardship versus their interest and their level of proof?\n\nBecause your brief seems to argue that the Mathews test is fully consistent with and would not require any material changes in the Court's traditional Barker-based analysis.\n\nThat's your brief at page 19.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think I want to—\n\nJudge: So due process does require Barker hearings. That's what we said in $8,850, and basically, you just don't want to call it a retention hearing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think I want to be clear of where we are in the analytical framework here. So we don't think there's ever a right to an interim hearing. We think the only right that there is is a timely final forfeiture hearing.\n\nAnd it's certainly true that someone whose forfeiture proceedings are ongoing can say: Look, this is moving too slowly under Barker, and the court can, you know, set its deadlines accordingly, can dismiss the case if it's already proceeded for too long a period of time.\n\nAnd we've also suggested that in this particular case where the claims really are just about timing—you know, Petitioners haven't alleged there wasn't due process to seize their vehicles, they haven't complained with the time—final proceeding, they can concede in their reply that sometimes a final forfeiture hearing could happen quickly enough, that when the claim is really about timing, that there's going to be little difference between applying $8,850 or Barker to that type of claim.\n\nJudge: But I guess—\n\nJudge: You keep saying \"timely.\" I don't know what timely is. I have a brief that set out the fact that on some hearings, by the nature of what the courts are doing, are taking up to a year or more.\n\nI don't consider that timely, if I'm an innocent owner who relies on my car for survival. And there's evidence of claimants who, in fact, had children, who lost their job, et cetera.\n\nSo how do we take care of those things?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think if you're concerned about that sort of thing, the claimant can raise the concern that the proceedings are already taking too long in their ongoing forfeiture proceedings or if the forfeiture proceedings haven't been filed, they can file a Rule 41(g) motion in the federal system or a Rule 313 motion in the Alabama system.\n\nSo there are ways to bring the timeliness claim up to a court without requiring a retention hearing in all cases. And I think one important thing to keep in mind, and, you know, Petitioner has focused extensively on the fact that there's an innocent owner defense at play here and that that somehow means that there's an earlier entitlement to a hearing.\n\nAnd Alabama law, the version of law that was in effect for this case, makes it clear that that is an affirmative defense.\n\nThat's in Wallace versus State, which—\n\nJudge: Is—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —is cited on page 3 of our brief.\n\nJudge: Is that part of its new law?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Excuse me?\n\nJudge: Is it part of the Alabama new law?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is not, no, but the Alabama new law, of course, is not at issue in this case.\n\nAnd the version of the innocent owner defense that's at issue here only comes in after the state has made out its prima facie case—\n\nJudge: Quite interesting, isn't it, that once the incentive is taken out of police officers taking advantage of the system as it exists, that Alabama puts in a system that is much fairer?\n\nThat was one of the reasons that Alabama resisted granting cert in this case because the new system does look to guarantee a faster process?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the new system's processes are different, but I think it's important to keep in mind that I don't even think the new system's process would have given these Petitioners faster process.\n\nSo the innocent owner defense under Alabama's new law, once an innocent owner seeks an innocent owner hearing, the state has up to 60 days to respond to that.\n\nAnd that's almost exactly the amount of time that Petitioners would have had their cars returned to them had they proceeded under Alabama state law as it had existed at the time of this case.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJustice Thomas, anything?\n\nJustice Alito?\n\nAnything further?\n\nJustice Kagan?\n\nJustice Gorsuch?\n\nJustice Jackson?\n\nJudge: Yeah, can I just clarify one thing? You—you say that you think that the only right is to a timely final forfeiture hearing, but I thought what was at issue in this case is the test that is to be used to make that determination.\n\nSo I appreciate that the government thinks it knows the answer in all of these cases, which is, you don't get a hearing. But I thought that we had tests that we applied in the law to lead us to that conclusion in particular cases, depending upon the claims and the circumstances.\n\nAnd so our question was what test?\n\nAnd am I wrong? It—it—it feels to me strangely like the government has picked the answer and is choosing the test that will inevitably lead to the answer that the government wants, as opposed to telling us here is the difference between the Barker test and the Mathews test and which one is better in terms of a—more consistent with our prior case law, et cetera, et cetera?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think we view the answer to the question presented as being it doesn't matter because the Court has essentially already decided this in Von Neumann, in $8,850. And I—\n\nJudge: What's your—what is—what is your view of my thought that Von Neumann is really much narrower in the language that you're talking about than the way it is being read, that it's been taken out of context?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think Von Neumann, the latter part of that decision, I—I read it as having assumed that there was a due process right to a timely remission—adjudication of the remission petition. And then the Court there found that—\n\nJudge: You mean in section 3?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: But in section 2, it says there is no such thing, so it's just kind of continuing to spin out the analysis, but it was pretty clear in 2 that the Court was finding that there was no such thing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That—that's certainly correct. I think the Court had maybe alternative holdings that you could—you could say, but I don't think the Court should just ignore the last section of Von Neumann.\n\nJudge: So the government's view is that on the methodology, it doesn't really matter whether we do Barker, or like the answer to the QP is it doesn't matter?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Because, in the past, when we looked at it, we had five criteria, and now today we have only three, and so maybe the government can argue this is moot because we've changed the way in which we evaluate the circumstances.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So that would certainly moot a case, but I think here it also moots it because, in the dynamic intelligence environment, every decision or delisting decision looks at the totality of circumstances at the point in time. And he was taken off not as a matter of grace.\n\nJudge: So it's not the special individualized treatment. I was going to ask you about that—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No. No.\n\nJudge: Because—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: He was taken off because he no longer posed a threat of engaging in one of those four acts of terrorism.

If it were some sort of innocuous act, presumably, we would put him back on it.\n\nJudge: Would your argument be different if it were just a year after?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Not necessarily. I think the eight years underscore the fact that these sorts of determinations are sticky, and I think the declaration makes it sort of sticky, and I think it makes it sticky enough, especially in this context where the standard is reasonable expectation—\n\nJudge: Well, counsel—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —to say let's not reasonably expect someone to pose a threat of engaging in—\n\nJudge: do you have any response to the Respondent's argument that Mr. Courtright doesn't even really have the ability to bind the government?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So it was a declaration filed in court under penalty of perjury.

{"id": "921", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Self-Determination Act entitles the tribes to recover the disputed contract support costs in this case. The bulk of the disputed costs are indirect costs.\n\nUnder Section 5325(a)(3)(A)(ii), such costs are recoverable if they are incurred in connection with the operation of the federal program, function, service, or activity pursuant to the contract. The disputed costs in this case meet that description.\n\nIf IHS was running tribal healthcare, it would collect program income and spend it on healthcare services. In the ISDA contract, IHS transferred to the tribe the responsibility both to collect and to spend the program income on healthcare. So, when the tribe carries out healthcare services using program income, it does so as a means of fulfilling its contractual obligation to further the general purposes of the contract. So it's acting pursuant to the contract.\n\nAnd a similar analysis applies to the smaller amount of direct contract support costs sought by Northern Arapaho under Section 5325(a)(3)(A)(i).\n\nSection 5326 is no barrier for the tribes' recovery of costs in this case. The costs are directly attributable to the contract because they arise from the tribes' work pursuant to that contract, and they're not associated with any third-party Medicare or Medicaid provider agreements because the costs have nothing to do with the work under those agreements.\n\nFinally, ruling in the tribes' favor would further the purposes of the ISDA by promoting tribal self-determination and ensuring that adequate resources are available for healthcare in chronically underserved communities.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: What do you do with -- you went directly to (a)(3)(A). What do you do with (a)(2)?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, we don't think we need to independently satisfy (a)(2). But, if you don't agree with me on that, we do --\n\nJudge: So you think it's just surplusage?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, it's not surplusage, Your Honor.\n\nSo I think that the sequence -- I want to make clear I think we do satisfy it, but I just want to, as our first-line argument, in 1988, Congress enacted (a)(2), and there were lots of disputes after that over what was covered, what wasn't covered.\n\nIHS was chronically not paying. And so, in '94, Congress added (a)(3) to clarify that those categories of costs are deemed to satisfy (a)(2).\n\nSo it seems to me that if Congress goes out of its way --\n\nJudge: Where does it say that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, it says \"shall include.\" So, if you look at the ordering, (a)(3) says the contract support costs that are eligible costs for the purposes of receiving funding under this chapter shall include the enumerated categories.\n\nThere's no cross-reference to (a)(2). There's no proviso. There is a proviso on (a)(1) but not (a)(2).\n\nSo it just seems to me, viewing this text literally, if you satisfy (a)(3), you prevail, and that's the point of adding this clarification.\n\nBut I just want to be clear, if you don't agree with anything I just said, that's not essential to our position.\n\nIf you think that we have to satisfy (a)(2), emphatically we think that we do.\n\nYou know, (a)(2) says that the costs shall consist of an amount for the reasonable cost of activities which must be carried out by a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract.\n\nThat is satisfied because (m)(1) is a term of the contract.\n\nWhen we are collecting and then spending the program income, we are acting as a contractor.\n\nWe must, under the contract, collect this money and spend it on healthcare services.\n\nSo we're acting as a contractor just as much as we're acting as a contractor when we spend money on the secretarial amount.\n\nSo, based on the first part of the argument, there were a number of questions that arose which I wanted to answer.\n\nI wanted to answer the questions about non-beneficiaries, as well as some of the other questions.\n\nJudge: Can I just ask you -- before you do that, really quickly, so (m)(1) is a term of the contract, but what do you say about their argument that (m)(1) obligation is more open-ended than the scope of the work itself?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I mean, it does give the tribe a measure of discretion.\n\nIt talks about general purposes, but I think that has to be read in conjunction with the contract itself, which doesn't say that the purpose is just generally to promote healthcare or generally to promote self-determination.\n\nThere's a purpose provision that says that the purpose of the contract is to transfer an enumerated set of obligations from IHS to the tribe.\n\nSo it seems to me that furthering the general purpose of the contract requires slotting it in one of those enumerated purposes or at least something that's really close to those purposes.\n\nI realize the word \"purpose\" has the word \"general\" attached to it, but I don't think that that entitles the tribe to just do whatever it wants or spend the money on healthcare in general.\n\nIt's got to be tied to the purpose provision in the contract itself.\n\nJudge: Well, but, I mean, if you add the direction to interpret the statutory language in favor of the tribes, that purpose provision doesn't seem to me to be a very significant constraint.\n\nI mean, the argument on the other side, or at least one of the concerns, is that the tribes would be able to expand the provision of healthcare to all sorts of areas that do not primarily benefit tribal members and yet still be entitled to reimbursement.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: All right. So let me address this issue of non-beneficiaries head-on because I understand it came up significantly in the first part of the argument.\n\nOkay. So, first of all, for about half of tribes, including San Carlos, they don't serve non-beneficiaries at all.\n\nEven for the others, it's often very little.\n\nSo let me just explain what Northern Arapaho does because a statement was made in the first half of the argument about Northern Arapaho's services to non-beneficiaries.\n\nNorthern Arapaho does serve non-beneficiaries but only if they're employees of Northern Arapaho's healthcare program, and that's less than 3 percent of the total number of users of Northern Arapaho's program.\n\nSo, if there's a nurse who's non-Indian who lives on the reservation and works at a Northern Arapaho clinic and then she wants to get her blood pressure checked, then, as an employee benefit, she can do that in the same building.\n\nShe doesn't have to drive potentially a long distance in central Wyoming to some other clinic.\n\nBut that is not -- that's not paid for by IHS.\n\nShe has to pay out of pocket or, realistically, from her own insurance policy, okay?\n\nSo none of the Secretary's funding ever goes to the provision of healthcare to those non-beneficiaries.\n\nJudge: That's not true for some tribes, is it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, I think it's true for all tribes.\n\nThe tribes can serve, but they can't spend the government's money because there can't be a diminution of healthcare services for Indians.\n\nSo I think the way it works is the non-Indian has to pay out of pocket or from the person's own insurance policy, and the tribe collects that money.\n\nI will acknowledge the tribe does consider that to be program income.\n\nThat's not a question raised in this case.\n\nBut the tribe thinks that if it's actually collecting that money, that's program income, but it then spends every single penny of that money on services for Indians.\n\nWe never ever spend the program income that we obtain on services for non-Indians.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "508", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Defendant: I—I didn't mean to be suggesting a—a clear statement rule.\n\nIt's a structural point about the INA.\n\nIn the INA, throughout the statute, when Congress wanted to preclude review of categories of claims, we see it over and over that it does so with express language.\n\nAnd here amicus is not pointing to any express language precluding review of CAT claims by aggravated felons.\n\nInstead, he's pointing to what is really just a generic 30-day filing deadline as a way of arguing that Congress indirectly or implicitly precluded judicial review of these claims.\n\nAnd I just think that, as a structural matter, that's hard to square with the INA, its context and its structure.\n\nJudge: And haven't we also said in Guerrero-Lasprilla that there's a presumption of judicial review, that, you know, we not foreclose the possibility of judicial review over agency action unless there's clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended that result?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's right, Your Honor.\n\nWe don't think you actually need to get to the presumption in this case because we think the statutory structure and the context are sufficiently clear to show that Congress wanted review of these claims, particularly Section 1252(a)(4), which is what I referenced in my introduction.\n\nBut we don't deny that if the statute were truly ambiguous, that the presumption would apply here.\n\nWe just don't think you need to get to that here.\n\nAnd just to get back to the Section 1252(a)(4) point, Your Honor, that is express textual evidence that Congress wanted there to be judicial review of CAT claims.\n\nAnd I think it stands to reason—and then we also have Nasrallah, which says that CAT orders are reviewable together with removal orders.\n\nAnd so I think it really does stand to reason that a CAT order must become final at the same time as a removal order so that a person can consolidate challenges to both orders into the same petition for review, which is what the zipper clause contemplates.\n\nAnother way of seeing the same point is that it's unlikely that Congress would have given express textual evidence that CAT claims are reviewable but at the same time written a deadline so short as to render many of those claims unreviewable.\n\nNormally, Congress doesn't give with the one hand and then take with the other in that sort of manner.\n\nJudge: Under your position, is it the case that an order that is final is rendered non-final by the filing of the subsequent application?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, that's not our position.\n\nOur position is that when a person has a withholding-only claim, the Section 1228(b) removal order does not ever become final until the withholding-only claim is resolved. It's not that it is final, then becomes non-final.\n\nIt's that it never became final in the first instance until those proceedings are resolved.\n\nAnd that's because—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nWhat is the time requirement for filing a withholding-only claim?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: The regulations contemplate that there—that the claim is raised when with the agency before the Section 1228(b) removal order is issued.\n\nAnd here it was—it was raised immediately after. So if there were a situation where a person didn't raise it for 30 days after the entry of the Section 1228(b) removal order, we would agree that at that point, the order would be final and the petition for review timeline would have run.\n\nBut here, and as—as is usually the case under the regulations, these claims are brought contemporaneously with the entry of the Section 1228 removal order.\n\nThe problem is that the resolution of those claims takes much longer because these are often very fact-intensive claims, as opposed to a Section 1228(b) removal order, which has very little process because it's meant to be expedited.\n\nJudge: And how long—do you know, by any chance, how long on average it takes to resolve CAT claims?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We don't have exact numbers, but my sense is it usually takes several months if it's a real—if it's a serious claim.\n\nIf it's a meritless claim, these can be resolved fairly quickly because the asylum officer will say that there's no negative—or there's no reasonable fear.\n\nThen the immigration judge will sustain that.\n\nAnd both of those officers have to make those decisions within a 10-day span.\n\nSo they can sometimes be resolved relatively quickly.\n\nBut here, when it's a serious claim, here the IJ actually found that he was entitled to CAT—to CAT relief, and then that was reversed by the BIA.\n\nWhen it's a serious claim like that, it could sometimes take several months to even over a year.\n\nThe dissent in Guzman Chavez pointed to some instances where they took multiple years, I believe.\n\nJudge: So as between the two—in light of that, as between these two options, which one is preferable and why? The first would be the requirement that a prophylactic petition for review be filed, and the second would be your position that there's no need to do anything until after the CAT claim is resolved.\n\nDo you think that your—that there's a risk that your position would lead to greater delay?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I don't think it would lead to greater delay because people are going to have incentives to bring these withholding-only claims no matter what because they can always bring the claim before the agency, and the removal order will be stayed pendency—pending the agency's resolution of the claim.\n\nSo these claims are going to be brought either way if there's a plausible reason to bring them.\n\nThe only additional delay, under our interpretation versus amicus's—and I'm setting aside the protective scheme which I've already discussed—but the delay here would be the time needed for the court of appeals to review the withholding-only determination.\n\nAnd I also want to just point out, in terms—in terms of the—any public safety concerns about giving this additional time or additional process to aggravated felons, it's important to bear in mind that they can be detained throughout the entirety of the agency proceedings, as well as subsequent judicial review proceedings.\n\nAnd this Court affirmed that power in Guzman Chavez.\n\nJudge: So just as a matter of government practice, when you have the order of removal but the CAT proceedings have not yet been concluded, what does the government feel itself free to do with the alien?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So we—the removal order would be stayed as to the designated country of removal.\n\nSo we would not be able to remove the person to that country.\n\nThere is this issue of third-country removal.\n\nAnd in that circumstance, I want to first point out that under Title 8, DHS does not pursue third-party—third-country removal while the withholding-only proceedings are ongoing.\n\nBut if it were to, the way it would work is this—\n\nJudge: So let me—let me make sure I understand that.\n\nYou think you have the—the—the legal right—\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's right.\n\nJudge: —to—to send the non-citizen to some other country, where he doesn't have a CAT claim, but, in fact, the U.S. government does not exercise that right?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "198", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: As to the different occasions-type question before the Court in this case, there were zero states before 1929 that allowed a judge, instead of a jury, to make such a finding. Amicus has gathered four states that argue against overruling Almendarez-Torres, along with a handful of other states with minor findings that are not related to offense-related conduct, which is the issue here.\n\nAmicus’s only substantial argument relates to determining the date of a prior conviction to establish that it was a second conviction or similar. However, that pertains to the inherent nature of the conviction, not the offense-related conduct. This distinction makes this case straightforward under Descamps and Mathis, whether based on statutory interpretation or historical principles.\n\nNow, regarding Descamps and Mathis, the Court has been clear. In Mathis, the Court stated that one reason for applying the categorical approach was to address \"serious Sixth Amendment concerns.\" In fact, the Court went even further in Mathis, stating unequivocally that any facts beyond the elements of the prior offense—when related to the conduct of that offense—must be determined by a jury and cannot be decided by a judge.\n\nJudge: May I ask—\n\nJudge: Mr. Counsel, could you address the history and tradition supporting your argument? A previous question suggested it would be unfair to place the burden on amicus to establish history and tradition. Could you elaborate on the jury’s role in fact-finding regarding recidivism?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Certainly. As outlined in our brief, even for prior convictions themselves, the prevailing practice was for juries to make these determinations. This was the established common law rule, and I don’t believe there is any dispute over that.\n\nFor any other facts that amicus identifies, the same principle applies. Additionally, the occasions inquiry in this case emerged from recidivism statute reforms in the 1960s, meaning there is no direct historical precedent for it. This makes it amicus, rather than us, who is deviating from tradition by allowing a judge to determine this fact rather than a jury.\n\nJudge: One more question. Do you agree with the government’s amicus that a harmless error analysis would apply?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, I believe Neder dictates that harmless error would apply in these cases. While this case may affect some pending cases in lower courts, once this rule is established, I don’t foresee it being a major issue going forward.\n\nJudge: May I ask—\n\nJudge: Please, go ahead.\n\nJudge: If there is a historical tradition of juries determining recidivism-related facts, as your response to the earlier question suggested, then what is the justification for the Almendarez-Torres carveout? Why does it exist?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I believe the Court’s jurisprudence justifies it on two grounds. First, in Almendarez-Torres, the Court referenced a tradition of judicial fact-finding in cases involving prior convictions. However, that tradition is relatively recent and does not align with the type of historical precedent the Court typically considers today.\n\nSecond, as the Court explained in Apprendi, when dealing solely with the fact of a prior conviction—the elements and nothing more—there are procedural safeguards, including the right to a jury trial during the original adjudication. These safeguards do not apply to other types of fact-finding, like the one at issue here.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "794", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-975, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition versus Eagle County, Colorado. Mr. Clement.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: NEPA is a self-described procedural statute.\n\nIt is designed to inform government decision-making, not paralyze it.\n\nNonetheless, it has become the single most litigated environmental statute.\n\nThe decision below helps explain why. Despite an environmental impact statement spanning 3600 pages, including 20 appendices, that addressed major impacts, minor impacts, downline impacts, and cumulative impacts, the D.C. Circuit demanded more.\n\nIt insisted that the Board study the future project developments in the entire basin, the prospect of accidents in train lines hundreds of miles away, and the effect on refineries in Gulf communities thousands of miles away. All of that is not just remote in time and space but falls well outside the STB's limited remand -- remit, and it falls within the jurisdiction of other agencies that can address those issues comprehensively and concretely if and when they arise.\n\nAnd the EIS here addressed almost all of those issues or at least identified them. But, in classic \"no good deed goes unpunished\" fashion, the D.C. Circuit held that because the agency identified the issue or flagged the issue, it was therefore foreseeable and they had to do more. That's a recipe for turning a procedural statute into a substantive roadblock. After all, infrastructure requires investment, and, for investors, time is money.\n\nProject opponents, by contrast, know that time is on their side and a remand just for a little more process can kill a project. The combined effect of proximate cause and the rule of reason should have made this a straightforward case.\n\nThe Board was not heedless of environmental effects here.\n\nIt consulted with dozens of agencies, considered every proximate effect, and ordered 91 mitigation measures.\n\nEighty-eight miles of track should not require more than 3600 pages of environmental analysis. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Mr. Clement, to the extent that some of these issues fall in the jurisdiction of other agencies, what role would Public Citizen play in disposing of those?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So Public Citizen, I think, instructs that when these age -- when these issues are both remote in time and effect and within the jurisdiction of other agencies, then the agency that approves this EIS is not the legally relevant cause, to use the phrase from Public Citizen, of any of the environmental effects. I think it's important to contrast the role of other agencies when it comes to things that are outside the scope of the project because, if other agencies have a partial role in issues that are within the scope of the project -- here, for example, the Forest Service had to approve a right -of-way for the train -- that is all taken care of in the consultation process.\n\nAnd, here, there was consultation to a fare-thee-well.\n\nThere were five other cooperative agencies.\n\nThere were 27 agencies that were consulted. But it never occurred to the Board that they should consult with Port Arthur, Texas.\n\nAnd those issues that are far outside the proximate effects of the -- of the project, if other agencies have those within their jurisdictions, then they're going to be the legally relevant cause of upstream development in the basin if it takes place 10 years from now.\n\nIf there's an accident in Colorado on the train tracks, that's an FRA issue, not an STB issue. And, obviously, what's going on in the Gulf communities is issues for Port Arthur, Texas, or maybe the EPA.\n\nJudge: I don't know how to articulate your rule in writing.\n\nThe NEPA itself says that -- requires agencies to \"consult with any federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.\" So we can't write and say you don't have to think about things that other agencies have jurisdiction over because the NEPA says that's what you got to do.\n\nAnd I don't think you're saying that if the Department of Transportation wants to authorize a highway running near a wetland, that NEPA wouldn't require the DOT to consider the environmental effect on the wetlands, even though a different agency has primary jurisdiction over wetlands. So it's -- your generalized rule, I don't have to think about it if another agency has jurisdiction, doesn't make much sense in this statutory scheme.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well --\n\nJudge: It has to be something more nuanced.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I -- I agree.\n\nAnd that's why my favored rule is not just, if it's another agency's jurisdiction, you don't have to look at it.\n\nBut what I tried to articulate in answering Justice Thomas's question is if the effect's already remote in time or space and in the jurisdiction of another agency.\n\nJudge: I don't even know what that means, because most environmental effects, like effects on wetlands, are going to be sometimes remote in time and geography.\n\nAnd even the Restatement says on the issue of proximate cause -- Restatement Third basically says time and geography are not at issue. If you've got a -- if you put a car in the stream of -- of -- of commerce where you know after a thousand miles it's going to blow up, it could go a thousand miles and 40 states away and blow up.\n\nThat's a reasonably foreseeable consequence that is remote in geography and time. These rules -- these absolute rules or how we explain them really depend on each individual case, so why don't we go back to this case for a moment, okay? I think your basic proposition and the one that Justice Thomas was saying, how is this similar to power? And I see it as similar to power because I think what you're trying to say is this agency's charged with putting a railroad in place.\n\nIts obligation is to carry passengers and cargo.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "859", "dialogue": "Judge: I guess what I don't understand is how your theory is consistent with what you say Congress's goals are with respect to Section 1. I mean, throughout your brief, you say that Section 1 was intended to capture workers \"critical to commerce and national security.\" So fine. We now have all these companies that have components of transportation within them, but their workers are doing things, as you say, involving goods that are crossing state lines and that are presumably critical to commerce and national security. So why would the line be between big companies with in-house transportation arms versus those that use FedEx?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm glad you asked that question. And it's the word \"presumably\" because, if something -- in most labor disputes, if you have a labor dispute between the employer and their employees, the employer is best situated to deal with that dispute. The time when that's not true is when you have transportation industry workers because there are third-party effects that cascade for the customers who have their goods on the rails to --\n\nJudge: But you're saying that that's what Congress -- I thought they were just trying not to have the disruption.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Congress was saying there are areas of the economy that are so important that we're doing our own federal arbitration scheme. We're not leaving it to the private parties to decide how they're going to resolve these remedies because they involve third-party concerns. And that was the history. In 1925, the railroad labor industry, there were all -- again, all sorts of industry disputes, but it was only the rail industry dispute that brought Chicago to the point of famine, and that's when Congress had to intervene and --\n\nJudge: Now, I just thought that was because of the nature of the goods and the fact that they were crossing state lines and they were sort of intranational. And that's the same with Amazon and Walmart and U.S. Foods and companies that have internal transportation arms today.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So today -- let's take Flowers. If Flowers can't ship its bread, that problem is best addressed between Flowers and its employees, but it doesn't mean that the nation runs out of bread. It means that people are going to have to buy other bread for a little bit of time. And that's true whenever you're talking about a manufacturer. If it's a single manufacturer that has a problem, there are other manufacturers who aren't implicated. Where you start to get the whole of the national economy involved is when you're talking about the international and interstate shipping of goods and that industry. And, again, we may come up with a lot of examples today where that doesn't make sense, but in 1925, that was the lesson that Congress had learned, and Congress responded by enacting arbitration provisions for only two members of the economy, two classes of workers, and they were both in the transportation industry.\n\nJudge: I just want to make sure that the background principles, I've got them in my head right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: These contracts that these employees have with the employers could be enforceable in state court. If they require arbitration in state court, if you file a suit in state court or they file a suit in state court, those arbitration agreements have to be honored, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's the position we took in the lower court, but there's a circuit court split on that question as well. And I don't think that's a good answer because, in a lot of states, you couldn't arbitrate this at all either, so you don't get --\n\nJudge: Because of state laws not permitting it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because of the state law.\n\nJudge: Got it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If you have no other questions?\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: One question.\n\nJudge: Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJudge: Is the phrase \"common carrier\" helpful or not helpful here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think it's helpful because, in the shipping industry, I mean, common carriers would mean ferries, and there's a whole component of the shipping industry that aren't common carriers that are really at the heart of it.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: Justice Barrett?

I mean, I thought that's what Holder versus Humanitarian Law Project allowed, so I don't really understand what you mean.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nRight.\n\nSo I'm glad you're bringing that up.\n\nJudge\nYes.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo, when it comes to national security, you are right that Congress can prohibit Americans, to use that case as an example, from associating with terrorist organizations or other organizations that pose a clear and present danger to this country. This case, Justice Jackson, is fundamentally different.\n\nWhat the government tells you in its own brief that it is worried about here are the ideas that might be expressed on TikTok.\n\nWe might undermine U.S. leadership. We might sow doubts about democracy.\n\nWe might have pro-China views. And so, if you look to whether that is a legitimate interest, my fundamental submission -- and this, I think, goes to the last colloquy you were having with Mr. Francisco -- is that is an impermissible government interest.\n\nAnd you look throughout our history and tradition, and I think the place I would point you most directly would be the opinions of Justice Brandeis in Whitney and Justice Holmes in Abrams --\n\nJudge\nI guess I don't understand how that's distinguishable from what's happening in Holder, and --and so can you just say a little bit more?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nIt's --it goes to the nature of the national security threat.\n\nSo my position is the government just doesn't get to come in and say national security and the case is over or you don't get to associate.\n\nYou have to dig underneath what is the national security claim.\n\nAnd what Justice Holmes said in his Abrams dissent -- and I know that was a dissent, these are hard issues, but that has been vindicated over time --is that it's not enough to say national security.\n\nYou have to say what is the real harm.\n\nIs it -- you know, is it terrorism? Is it where --where our battleships are located?\n\nJudge\nBut Justice Kavanaugh --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nIs it war?\n\nJudge\n-- Justice Kavanaugh presented a number of potential risks, right, with --with foreign adversaries using covert manipulation of the data platforms that are being used by youths today that would then make it more likely that people would turn into spies and do terrible things to the United States. This is a hypothetical, but --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nJudge\n-- you know what I'm saying?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nI -- I get it.\n\nSo I think, if I understood Justice Kavanaugh correctly, he was talking about the data security arguments.\n\nLet me just pull these apart.\n\nYou first have an argument -- and the government itself separates these two arguments in its brief.\n\nThe first argument and the one I'm focusing on initially is the content manipulation argument, and that argument is that our national security is implicated if the content on TikTok is anti-democracy, undermines trust in our leaders.\n\nThey use --they use various phrases like that in their brief.\n\nSo my primary submission is that is an impermissible government interest that taints the entire Act.\n\nNow there's a secondary argument the government makes, and we say you don't even get to that because, once you have an impermissible motive like that, the law is unconstitutional.\n\nBut, even if you could get to that, Justice Jackson, I do grant that data security in -- in the way Justice Kavanaugh spelled it out is compelling.\n\nThat is compelling.\n\nBut that's not the question.\n\nYou just don't ask in the air, you know, was Congress worried about data security or could it reasonably worry --be worried about data security? You say, can this Act, the Act before you, be sustained on data security grounds? And our answer to that has to be no. You don't have to look any further than the divest -- the -- the divestiture provision itself, which says that the content recommendation algorithm cannot be used in the future.\n\nWell, that has nothing to do with data security.\n\nSo the core feature of the divestiture provision is going at content manipulation, which I say is impermissible.\n\nYou can't -- you can't uphold that under data security grounds.\n\nAnd the rest of the Act, when you look at the covered companies provision, Justice Jackson, if this were primarily a data security law, what you think you'd find is, what kind of data is procured? How is it stored? Is it shared? Those are the things you think you'd find under covered companies.\n\nBut you don't find that.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "683", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Can I just ask about Franklin? Because I think Franklin's a critical case here because it's identified in Barnett, identified in Watters, so — and in figuring out, as Justice Kagan and Justice Thomas say, what \"significantly interferes\" means, I think one way to do is look at the precedent applying it.  \nSo Barnett, if you look at that first, but Barnett really rests heavily on Franklin.  \nWe know Franklin is correctly decided —  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Correct.  \n\n**Judge:** — under the statute. You agree with that?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Agree with that entirely.  \n\n**Judge:** Okay.  \nSo then the question, I think one way to look at it — you tell me why this is wrong — is, does this kind of state law at issue here significantly interfere more than the law did in Franklin? Is that a good way to look at it?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** You could put it that way, yes.  \n\n**Judge:** Okay. And doesn't a law that interferes with the pricing of the product almost by definition interfere more with the operations of a bank than something that affects advertising?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** I don't think so, Your Honor. And I would — the question isn't whether it would cost money to the bank to comply with the statute. The question, rather —  \n\n**Judge:** Well, let me stop you right there.  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Sure.  \n\n**Judge:** Why not? That sounds like significant interference when it's affecting how much — it's almost putting a tax on the bank to sell the product, which strikes me as a much more significant interference than simply saying you can't use the word \"savings\" in your advertising, which was the issue in Franklin.  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Well, if the test for preemption turned entirely on compliance costs, then a whole bunch of generally applicable laws that my friend on the other side concedes are not preempted would nevertheless be preempted if it cost money to the bank to comply with those.  \nSo I don't think compliance costs alone are enough.  \nI think what you need instead is what this Court said in Barnett Bank, which is it's not enough that there just be significant interference with, you know, profits. The question is whether there's a significant interference with a power that Congress explicitly granted.  \nAnd so the focus is on what Congress —  \n\n**Judge:** But how did that happen in Franklin?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** So the power —  \n\n**Judge:** Franklin, they could do — the bank could do everything that it previously did. It just couldn't use the word \"savings\" in its advertisement, which didn't prevent it from exercising its power.  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** That's right.  \nBut, as I was explaining earlier, if you take a look at the record in that case, that case shows that a factual showing can be made and was made in that case, and I would commend the trial court's decision there because I think it's illuminating for this question.  \nAnd everyone in the case seemed to understand coming on the heels of Anderson that there was going to be some kind of a practical showing.  \nAnd this Court noted the large record showing the real-world consequences of the law in its opinion.  \nAnd there was all kinds of — there was testimony, there was consumer polling, there were lost sales, there was a significant amount of data showing the degree to which this prohibition had a real-world effect.  \n\n**Judge:** Isn't it true that the New York court of appeals, when it upheld the law, said that it had no \"seriously harmful effects on national banks\"?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** That may have been what it said, but if you look at the trial court's finding in the case, the trial court found that based on the evidence that I was discussing earlier, the law \"certainly restricts national banks tremendously in obtaining savings deposits.\"  \nAnd that's effectively a finding of significant interference.  \n\n**Judge:** I mean, the law said they couldn't use \"savings\" in their advertising, but they could use a comparable phrase like \"special interest account.\"  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** And —  \n\n**Judge:** So, if any interference that's greater than the interference there is enough, that wouldn't be — I don't see how you can win under that.  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Two responses, Your Honor.  \nIf you look at the testimony in that case, it was clear that consumers had no idea what \"interest-bearing account\" meant. The word \"savings\" actually mattered to their purchasing decisions, and it had a real-world effect.  \nAnd that was a law that was discriminatory and put the national banks at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to state banks.  \nAnd, of course, under this statute, a discriminatory law would be preempted for independent reasons.  \nThe way this statute is designed is that non-discrimination is the most important principle that runs through the statute.  \nAnd if a law is non-discriminatory, then we can assume that the hostility that states have traditionally shown to national banks is not going to be reflected in their laws because we're only going to be talking about laws that involve restrictions that states are willing to impose on their own banks.  \n\n**Judge:** Do you think that the significant interference test should be applied on a bank-by-bank basis or on an industry basis?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** No, it's not bank by bank.  \nThat's not how it works in our view.  \nIf you look at the statute, it's clear that when the OCC makes preemption determinations, it does so on a law-by-law basis, not a bank-by-bank basis.  \nAnd even there, in consultation with the CFPB, it can make preemption determinations that go beyond that law and reach substantively equivalent laws.  \n\n**Judge:** Is that a pure question of law? Is it a mixed question? Is it a question of fact?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** The ultimate preemption determination —  \n\n**Judge:** No, the question of whether it significantly interferes. Is that a question of fact?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** It's a legal question for a court, but because it takes account of the practical effects of the law, you have to know what those effects are.  \nAnd if the OCC hasn't identified the effects, then it's going to be incumbent on the bank, if there's no statute on point and we're talking about a non-discriminatory law, to explain what those effects are.  \nAnd then the fight is not going to be about necessarily the effects of the law but about whether that rises to the level of significant interference —  \n\n**Judge:** Well, but the burden would —  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** — and that's a legal question.  \n\n**Judge:** The burden would be on the plaintiff challenging it, wouldn't it?  \n\n**Defendant’s Lawyer:** Well, this is — I mean, if the plaintiff is a national bank challenging the law, then yes, the burden would be on the national bank.  \nConversely, if, as in this case, the preemption is raised as an affirmative defense, then the burden would still be on the national bank.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "208", "dialogue": "Judge\nAssume you lose that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nIf we lose that, then what that means -- all that means is that we have a claim, right? The relator has a claim.\n\nAnd it would certainly be the relator's job, assuming this gets to trial, to prove up damages and the jury's job then to decide what it is.\n\nJudge\nRight, right, right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSo I think the mismatch --\n\nJudge\nBut is the relevant number that the relator, in your view, would be aiming at the $20,000 that I'm hypothesizing, or would it be some marginal cost to the government, or, as a matter of law, for a jury instruction, would you be saying, you know, it's zero because the government didn't actually suffer any loss? Even though the government provided the hundred million dollars, the damages sustained to the government were none?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI think the way I would answer that, Your Honor, is to -- to look to the text of the remedial provision, which refers to damages that the government sustains. And so it would be the relator's job at trial to prove that amount, whatever that is.\n\nAnd I -- and we would -- we would retain our full panoply of arguments why the relator isn't entitled to a dime for that or for other reasons.\n\nJudge\nThank you, Counsel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nJustice Jackson?\n\nJudge \nSo it seems to me that your \"provides\" argument rests on the premise that the FCA is about putting the public fisc at risk.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge \nYou've said this many times and that there is, you said, a historical link between the public fisc and the FCA.\n\nAnd I guess I'm looking at the history and I don't really see it that way, so I'd like for you to respond.\n\nYou know, as I read the history of the FCA, the purpose is broader than just trying to protect the public fisc.\n\nIn fact, when Congress passed in 1986 the amendments where \"claim\" -- the \"claim\" definition that we're talking about here was put into the statute, it also had a report that talked about what it was doing, and that GAO report documented widespread fraud in government programs and focused on \"the non-monetary effects\" of the fraud and Congress's concern that it wasn't just about the money.\n\nIt talked about things like the loss of confidence in government programs.\n\nIt pointed to incidents in which the beneficiaries of the program did not get the benefits that Congress wanted them to get.\n\nSo it was clearly beyond the fiscal impact.\n\nAnd so what I guess I'm wondering is: Doesn't that sort of undermine your argument that all we need to care about here is looking at this through the lens of whether or not the government has actual monetary skin in the game in this way?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nRespectfully, no, Your Honor, and -- and I think that's the case for three reasons. And let me start with this Court's precedents on the False Claims Act, and this Court has said again and again that the False Claims Act is not an all-purpose fraud statute, even fraud against the government.\n\nIt is not an all-purpose fraud statute against the government.\n\nI think the reason for that is that at every juncture from the 1986 amendments to the 2009 amendments, Congress has made adjustments to the False Claims Act, but it has never --\n\nJudge \nYeah.\n\nNo, I'm not talking -- I -- I -- I --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- it has never severed the rule from that.\n\nJudge \nNo, I understand. But I guess what I'm trying to perhaps get your feedback on is if we think that the False Claims Act was doing more than just caring about whether the government lost a dollar as a result of this fraud but, in fact, was also about whether the fraud prevented the program from operating.\n\nThe government has lots of different ways in which it might fund its programs.\n\nSome of them might be direct funding from the government.\n\nSome of them might be orders by the government to have other people fund the program.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, what the government wants is for that program to operate effectively.\n\nIt wants it to work.\n\nAnd fraud, says the government in its reports when it put out the FCA, is undermining the effectiveness of our program.\n\nSo you want us to make a distinction about whether or not the FCA applies that is based on the mechanism of funding, but that just assumes that the mechanism of funding mattered to the government.\n\nAnd I'm telling you that from the history, what -- the -- the government was broader than the mechanism of funding as the reason why the FCA should apply.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd I think, Your Honor, the best -- our -- our -- our surest instrument for registering the concern and purpose of Congress is the text of the statute that it enacted.\n\nAnd --\n\nJudge \nNo, I understand.\n\nI understand.\n\nBut you make --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- and it referred -- and it referred to me --\n\nJudge \n-- a lot of representations about what -- I'm only going this route because your whole argument is the government wanted in the FCA to have this protection of the government funds.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes.\n\nJudge \nSo let me just ask you one final question.\n\nWhat -- what do you do with the fact that the House report from 1986 that discusses the statutory definition of \"claim\" says, \"A claim upon any government agency or instrumentality, quasi-governmental corporation, or non-appropriated fund activity is a claim against\" -- \"upon the United States under the Act.\" It seems very clear that Congress wanted to get at things beyond just actual government agencies in this way, that they were also sweeping in government corporations, et cetera, as necessary to make sure that its programs operated.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes, Your Honor.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "187", "dialogue": "Judge: So we think that it is forum manipulation, particularly in this case, where they waited almost two years to amend the complaint after they lose in the Eighth Circuit.\n\nJudge: We think that's a form of forum manipulation.\n\nJudge: We think there are much more extreme forms of forum manipulation, for example, where a plaintiff -- you know, the district court says: I'm about to rule against you.\n\nJudge: That's what happened in three cases on page 16 of the yellow brief.\n\nJudge: And the plaintiff says: Great, send me back to state court.\n\nJudge: And that's a very serious form of forum manipulation.\n\nJudge: But we agree, Your Honor, in many cases, the mine-run of cases, you get to federal court, you immediately amend the complaint, the federal judge is going to send that back to state court.\n\nJudge: We're really talking about the more unique circumstances like this one where it's been going on for a long time and Congress wanted district courts to consider different considerations.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Justice, do you have any questions?\n\nJudge: Justice, you asked about what happens when the -- a judge dismisses some of the federal -- the federal claims, and you responded to that.\n\nJudge: And you were referring to (c)(3), which only refers to the district court dismissing those claims.\n\nJudge: It says -- but (c)(3) says nothing about the instance in which the party amends the complaint and eliminates the federal claims.\n\nJudge: Would you address that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Certainly.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's a really important point.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So that is addressed in (c)(2).\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, in (c)(2), where there is no longer a federal claim, the state claim will substantially predominate.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: It could also fall under (c)(4), an exceptional circumstance.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I would point out, Your Honor, that (c) is simply listing when district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. This Court in Exxon Mobil against Allapattah said really the key question is, is it in the statute? And -- and, certainly, amendments to the complaint are not in the statute.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So we think that's sufficient.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: But, if you want to look at the text of (c)(2), I think that also answers the question.\n\nJudge: But -- but do you agree that when the district court dismisses a claim, it remains in the case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I agree, Your Honor. But that is also true of an amended complaint. You can appeal whether a complaint was properly amended.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We cited the Lucente case in the Second Circuit that reinstates the original complaint on appeal.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, if that's the test, we think that's met.\n\nJudge: Do we normally think of a complaint that's amended by the party to eliminate a federal claim as still having that claim?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think that's true of all these circumstances.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Where the claim becomes moot, where the parties settle, where the plaintiff voluntarily amends, where the district court dismisses, those claims, for the purposes of the party, aren't going to continue to be litigated.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We think the important question here is: When do you evaluate whether there is an original federal question in the case? Under this Court's longstanding precedent going all the way back to St. Paul Mercury, you look at the time of removal, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So when does an amended complaint supersede the earlier complaint?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, we don't think that's the right question.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: The question isn't whether it supersedes the original complaint.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: The question is: At the time of removal, is there an original federal question in the case? We think that's what the phrase \"in the action\" is doing.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If you look directly at Gibbs, which is where that language came from, Gibbs is saying what you need is the original claim and the supplemental claim to be in the same case. That's true regardless of whether the complaint is amended.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That claim was filed in the same case.\n\nJudge: When many courts of appeals have considered a question and they've all decided it the same way, that certainly requires very respectful consideration.\n\nJudge: They are very likely correct.\n\nJudge: But would you also recognize that there can be circumstances in which there can be sort of a snowball effect in busy courts of appeals, particularly on certain -- a certain category of issues so that if a court of appeals decides a question one way, then the next one just latches onto that, and pretty soon, courts of appeals confronting an issue are very likely to say: Wow, if all these other circuits have gone this way, I'm not going to create a conflict in the circuits on this, I'm just going to go along with it.\n\nJudge: Do you think that's a -- a dynamic that can occur in courts of appeals and, if so, should we take it into account?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think that's possible, Your Honor, but I think this is a pretty unique case.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We searched high and low, and the only two cases we found that went the other way was one district court case from 1915 and one district court case from 1940.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That is overwhelming precedent in the courts of appeals.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And if you look at cases like Boelens, which is a case that Justice Scalia cited in Rockwell from the Fifth Circuit, it very carefully explains the reasoning of why we treat these two circumstances differently. I think you also have to look at this Court's precedents, cases like International College of Surgeons, Rosado, Carlsbad, Osborn against Haley.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: All of those cases are suggesting that this is a doctrine of discretion.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So this Court has been giving the lower federal courts the same signal for many, many decades that this is how we're going to treat this situation, and we think that's what Congress codified in the text of Section 1367 itself.\n\nJudge: Well, do you think that -- that courts of appeals read our decisions differently than we may? I mean, you know, I'm -- I was on a court of appeals for 15 years.\n\nJudge: If I saw a strong dictum in a Supreme Court decision, I would very likely just salute and move on.\n\nJudge: But, here -- (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: -- we have --\n\nJudge: Not now.

{"id": "168", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer: So two responses.\nI think Franklin would have come out the other way because there was—the New York court of appeals said there's not a sufficient showing.\nBut, more importantly, and this, I think, goes to the congressional design of the National Bank Act, is that they're supposed to be—you know, why have your name Bank of America if you look like Bank of Ocean City or Bank of Hawaii? You're supposed to be able to walk into Bank of America and get one product and not have 50 products in 50 states, and every time a state says change your escrow, you have to change another aspect of the loan—\n\nJudge: Well, I—I—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —on the origination fee.\n\nJudge: I—I totally get that impulse that national banks don't want to have to deal with patchwork state laws, but the presumption, the baseline that Congress set is it's not preempted unless discrimination or you can—you can prove significant impact.\nSo that—we can't take that argument very seriously, that it's just too much of an impairment on national banks.\nThey have to deal with reality that we live in a federal system with 50 states.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\nI mean, it just seems like you're kind of reading the provision, I mean, upside down.\nYou could read Barnett Bank the same way and say this Court had—\n\nJudge: You say \"upside down,\" but that's what the statute says.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: You could say 150 years of case law says states can regulate unless there's a—\n\nJudge: Well, that's what Congress said, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I agree.\nAnd I think that the Court said it's preempted under Barnett Bank if it prevents or significantly interferes.\nAnd then you go to Barnett Bank, and it tells you, I think five times, that we read it in light of Franklin.\n\nJudge: You mentioned earlier that you thought state lending laws with respect to race, religion, and others are not preempted.\nWhy?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the—the case—\n\nJudge: On your view, if states don't get a role and you really—Barnett Bank should be inverting the statute, and the presumption is national banks operate free of state control, that would seem to subsume those laws too—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —that principle.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So no for—for this fundamental reason, and that is that states have—I'm sorry, national banks have no power whatsoever to discriminate on the basis of race or to commit fraud.\nAnd this Court, in the 1924 case of First National Bank versus Missouri, said when it said that state law that bans national banks from having bank branches, the Court said it can't preempt it because there's no either—no express power or even implied power to do branches.\nSo I think the OCC has correctly taken the view since 2004 that there is no—there's—there's simply no power to—\n\nJudge: So from—\n\nJudge 2: But if I understand—\n\nJudge: Oh, please.\n\nJudge 2: If I understand your test correctly, you're looking to see whether a state is conditioning the exercise of a national bank power.\nAnd for sure that's what fair lending laws do.\nIt says, you know, you can't make the loan decisions that you want to make, except conditioned on your satisfying some state law.\nA lot of state laws can be explained in just that way, and that's—I—I think that that's the test you use in your brief.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah, but—\n\nJudge 2: Fair lending laws are a condition on a national bank's power.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But—but so is—so is a law that says you can't lend a mortgage to a two-year-old.\nThat's conditioning the bank's power on, you know, making sure the person is 18.\nBut those laws aren't preempted.\nAnd I think the useful dividing line is, are you changing the attributes of the product of service?\n\nJudge: Absolutely you are.\nYou're saying I'm not—you have to lend to people you don't want to lend to.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, that's the same way with a—with a four-year-old.\nBut if I could just get, I mean, the—\n\nJudge: A four-year-old, a 24-year-old, whatever, and, yes, they're—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But there's no bank—\n\nJudge: And just—just a second, counsel.\nThere are going to be a patchwork of states with different judgments, and you're going to disagree with some of them.\nAnd I—and all of them have to do with the core banking powers of who you may lend to, who you may open an account for, what interest you can charge, and all of that.\nAnd, you know, it seems to me, not to put too fine a point on it, that there's a bit of wanting your cake and eating it too here.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, because we're happy with, again, your precedent.\nYour precedent has been very careful to make sure that states can go right up to the line.\nAnd I think Anderson says that.\nYou can talk about, you know, you can interact with the account holder and the bank in things like contract law, age requirements, statute of frauds, and if I can get back to discriminatory lending, banks don't have any power to discriminate on the basis of race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, but they sure have to discriminate on the basis of income status.\nSo yes, if a state law said you can't discriminate on the basis of income, that's going to preempt it because there's a federal duty to mitigating at risk.\nBut this is, again—and same way with fraud, I don't think fair lending laws, state lending laws that prohibit fraud in lending are preempted either.\nThey just never have been.\n\nJudge: So you can discriminate on the basis of income but not race.\nHow about like redlining neighborhoods and things like that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Disparate impact is—I mean, that's extremely heavily regulated by federal law, and I don't think that—\n\nJudge: But I'm asking—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —I don't think—\n\nJudge: —about non-discriminatory state laws.\nThen what?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think any states have argued—sorry, federal—national banks have argued disparate impact laws are preempted because they are so—\n\nJudge: But under your test, why wouldn't they be?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I mean, we can talk about the theory behind disparate impact probably, but I—I think it's one of those areas on how you consider, how you look at disparate impact.\n\nJudge: You might—you might argue those are—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Just—\n\nJudge: —are preempted under your test?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think so, but even if they did, it's still—the line that we're drawing is the line this Court has drawn I think since—since Anderson and before that, that if you're not changing the attribute—and I don't think it changes the loan attribute to say is the person black or white or green.\nIt's still a loan with the same interest rate, the same term.\nIf you say state law says I don't want national banks paying less than 2 percent or 3 percent or 4 percent on savings accounts or no mortgage loans that are under 29 months and 10 months, it's just the product.\nThat is literally the—the product.\nAnd I think we talked about the credit cards and the ATM fees, how much cash you can withdraw.\nHow much cash you can withdraw has nothing to do with the consumer walking in.\nIt literally is the core banking service itself.\nAnd this has been the workable standard.\nThis has been the settled expectation.",

{"id": "150", "dialogue": "Judge: One level, this is a very large case about fundamental liberty interests. At another level, I wonder if it's a small case. We talked about remedies a little bit a moment ago, you and I, and I'm just curious, what remedy does the plaintiff seek here? I know they wanted originally a declaration that there wasn't a bona fide reason, seeming to take Mandel as given. I'm looking at page 13 of their complaint. But they got that. They got that reason. They got the Mandel reason. Then they want a declaration that the statute's unconstitutionally vague. That's not before us. Then they want their costs. That's not before us. And I guess, you know, of course, the usual catch-all, grant such further relief, but if a district court can't order the husband into the country, what other relief remains that's available for a court to issue?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We don’t think there is any. I think that they've asked for declaratory judgment, that the reason that was given was not good enough. I think that now they would say that if this Court—\n\nJudge: I mean, if they wanted—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —says that the Ninth Circuit is wrong about what we did give, then—then—\n\nJudge: Well, the—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —they would be entitled to more, I guess, is what they would be saying on remand.\n\nJudge: So—so how about this, that, you know, the declaratory judgment would be you got the Mandel reason because that's what the Ninth Circuit found. It just wasn't timely, period.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the Court didn’t grant review on the third QP. We think that the timeliness analysis is wrong and we think it's particularly odd to say that—\n\nJudge: Fine.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —that this lawsuit needs to churn along at this point.\n\nJudge: Would the government oppose a declaratory judgment that it wasn't timely in its Mandel statement?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I—\n\nJudge: And what harm would that do?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —without knowing what the consequences of that are, I—I—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —I understand your point. And—and so I—I don't know what else they would get out of a declaration that it's untimely. The Ninth Circuit obviously wanted there to be further proceedings and they wanted there to be more information that was provided, and I understand my friend to be asking for more information even now.\n\nJudge: But you wouldn’t know what—well, if the court’s correct in the Ninth Circuit that they got all the information they were due at least at the Mandel stage and the Ninth Circuit’s remanding to pierce that to conduct some sort of due process analysis about whether it was good enough, what could the Ninth Circuit or district court do at the end of that proceeding that would be lawful?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We—we don’t think anything, but I don’t think that’s a reason to affirm what the Ninth Circuit said here. I think that would be a reason to reverse and say that—that this case is—\n\nJudge: Well, counsel, I'm not fighting you. I'm just asking some questions.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, and—and I agree with you, that I—I don’t know what they—I don’t think there is anything that the court ought to be able to do on remand.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Thank you.\n\nJudge: So, counsel, I had understood the government—this goes to the threshold question. I had understood the government to essentially be asking us to take a certain position, but based on some of your colloquies with my colleagues today, I’m thinking that maybe what the government’s first-order position is, and I had not gotten this from the brief, I thought you just mentioned it in a footnote, is to say that Mandel should never have assumed that there was an exception if there was a fundamental right implicated. Is that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I—I think that the point of a prior plurality opinion would be that there wouldn’t be an exception to consular nonreviewability that applied anyway, so I think it would get there one way or the other.\n\nJudge: No, I agree, but it's different. I mean, I think another Justice called it a much more dramatic holding. It would be different. I—I guess I see you potentially asking us to do one of two things. One would be to say there’s no fundamental right here, she doesn’t have a fundamental right in having her spouse live with her in the United States, and so the Mandel exception isn’t triggered and she’s not entitled to anything.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is our—that is our front-line position, I agree.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: So you’re not asking us to say and, by the way, people shouldn’t have an opportunity to show that there’s a fundamental right implicated because, after all, Mandel had just assumed that. It didn’t say that you are entitled to get a Mandel explanation if you can point to the existence of a fundamental right? Do you see what I’m saying?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s right. And I was—I was saying for purposes of the assumption in a prior question that if—if we assume that there is a constitutional liberty interest that is sufficient to trigger that review in Mandel, why isn’t this one equally good?\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And our position is that this is not, as the—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —plurality concluded in a prior case, not a sufficient liberty interest to trigger any exception to consular nonreviewability that would look like Mandel review. So we think you don’t get to Mandel review one way or the other.\n\nJudge: No, no, and I understand that, but I guess I’m—I’m still not quite sure what your position is. I understand that. I’m just asking you, are you asking us to say, to go still further than that and say and, by the way, Mandel just assumed that there would be an exception to consular nonreviewability if there was a fundamental right implicated, but we think there’s no such exception at all. So not only is this one not good enough, there’s—are you asking us to do that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I don’t think you need to do that. I think the question presented is based on the idea that there is the background of—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —consular nonreviewability and the exception is not triggered here—\n\nJudge: That is what I—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —for that reason.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "938", "dialogue": "Chief Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 22-913, Devillier versus Texas.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is resolved by the text of the Fifth Amendment, which, unlike any other provision of the Constitution, imposes on the government an explicit duty to pay money.\n\nIt's also answered by this Court's decision in First English, which holds that the just compensation remedy is mandatory and that the Fifth Amendment itself furnishes a basis on which a court can award just compensation in an inverse condemnation case.\n\nAnd this right of property owners to sue in inverse condemnation to obtain just compensation for an alleged taking is at the heart of modern American takings law.\n\nIt's at the heart of inverse condemnation claims filed against state and local governments nationwide. And it's also at the heart of every takings claim filed against the federal government under the Tucker Act.\n\nThe Tucker Act provides no cause of action, no substantive entitlement to a remedy. The cause of action, the substantive entitlement to a remedy, in every Tucker Act takings case is the self-executing Fifth Amendment—the same cause of action recognized in First English, the same cause of action pled here.\n\nTo reject that cause of action now is to upend the way lower courts, both state and federal, understand the Takings Clause to work and also to abandon this Court's consistent explanations of that clause—not just in First English but in more recent cases like Knick v. Township of Scott. And there's no reason to make that kind of drastic change.\n\nThis Court has already recognized that money-mandating legal obligations logically come along with the right to file a lawsuit to enforce those obligations.\n\nThat's true as to statutes, which is what this Court held in Maine Community Health Options.\n\nIt should be at least as true as to the Constitution, and this Court's precedents consistently teach that it is.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: In your reply brief, you say that the 19th-century federal courts were faced with a bedrock property right and no way to enforce it directly. Doesn't that seem to be at odds—the fact that the courts there had to resort to extra-constitutional causes of action—isn't that at odds with your argument now?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think so, Your Honor, because the primary problem facing federal courts in the early part of the 19th century was a lack of jurisdiction.\n\nAnd I think the question of jurisdiction is just conceptually distinct from the question of whether there's a cause of action, whether there's a right to a remedy.\n\nCongress could tomorrow amend Section 1331 to reimpose an amount-in-controversy limit, and if it did that, that would prevent a number of people from bringing Ex parte Young actions in federal court.\n\nThose claims wouldn't cease to exist. Congress would just have eliminated the jurisdiction over them.\n\nAnd so I think there's a difference between jurisdictional limits—which limited takings claims—and even pleading requirements like the limits to the forms of action, which also limited plaintiffs' abilities to bring certain kinds of claims, and the core question presented here, which is just whether there is an entitlement to relief.\n\nThere's only one modern form of action, which just takes the shape of saying, I'm entitled to this remedy for that reason. The remedy is just compensation.\n\nThe reason is the Fifth Amendment as applied through the Fourteenth.\n\nAnd once the jurisdictional problems and the pleading problems are removed, as they have been in this case, the only question remains whether the Fifth Amendment mandates compensation, whether it mandates that remedy, which this Court has already answered.\n\nFirst English says that the just compensation remedy is mandatory. And I think contrasting the arguments of the other side with the rule adopted by the California Supreme Court in Agins is actually a useful illustration here.\n\nThe California Supreme Court's decision in Agins said, \"We as a common law court don't want to recognize a claim for just compensation in a regulatory takings case. We think that intrudes on the legislature's prerogative. We don't recognize that cause of action.\"\n\nAnd First English says that doesn't matter. The cause of action, the entitlement to relief, flows directly from the Fifth Amendment.\n\nSo too here. The complaint here pleads a cause of action directly under the Fifth Amendment—\n\nJudge: Counsel—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —that says our property was taken and the Fifth Amendment—\n\nJudge: Counsel, I agree that jurisdiction and a cause of action are distinct, but it's a little bit hard to see how in 1791— I mean, I think your argument is, when the Fifth Amendment was ratified, those who ratified it had to see the Fifth Amendment as itself supplying the cause of action because this was the crucial way to vitiate the takings right, the right to just compensation.\n\nBut Congress didn't provide for federal question jurisdiction until 1875, so that kind of languished on the vine for a pretty long time if you're right that the founding generation—or the ratifying generation in 1791—viewed it that way.\n\nMoreover, the historical evidence of private bills runs contrary to your argument because, yes, there was a right to just compensation, but we have all of this time throughout the 19th century of Congress enacting private bills to give just compensation.\n\nAnd I think you have to contend with that because, I mean, I get that this is against Texas, against the state, but if the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Fifth Amendment as it was, there's kind of a mountain of historical evidence you've got to contend with.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I don't think that mountain does quite the work that Texas needs it to, Your Honor.\n\nAnd I think one problem here is the difficulty in mapping the modern conception of cause of action onto 1791 visions of the court.\n\nI think, if you asked a lawyer in 1791 whether the Fifth Amendment contained a cause of action, they probably wouldn't understand the question.\n\nBut, if you asked them, \"Can a property owner sue to enforce just compensation?\" the answer absolutely would have been yes.\n\nIt would have been a suit in trespass. It would perhaps have been a suit in ejectment.\n\nBut there was an understanding at the framing that this was an enforceable right—\n\nJudge: Well, that establishes at most, it seems to me, that the Fifth Amendment envisioned some remedial mechanism would be available.\n\nAnd the common law trespass, as you point out, might have been it, or conversion might have been it.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that there is itself an independent cause of action under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think it does, Your Honor, once the forms—\n\nJudge: Why? You've just conceded that the cause of action that the Framers would have understood would have been in trespass.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I think, in modern terms, what the Court means when it says \"cause of action\"—\n\nJudge: Well, no.\n\nBut we're talking about the original meaning, and you're asking us to appeal to the original meaning and say they would have understood there would have been a cause of action.\n\nPerhaps, but what would that cause of action look like?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think they would have understood that there was an entitlement to a remedy.\n\nJudge: Some remedy?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: An entitlement to just compensation as a remedy.\n\nJudge: Some way to get that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, and I think—\n\nJudge: Fair enough.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean there's a federal cause of action. It could mean it happens under state common law, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, two—\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "467", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWhat -- what should it add properly construed?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I -- I -- I think it should be more focused on the project at hand and NEPA challenges -- you know, the universe of situations where the NEPA challenge is successful but the substantive environmental statute challenge is unsuccessful should be a pretty small universe. And it should either be pretty egregious violations of -- you know, of -- of -- of -- of the scope of what they should be looking at, or, you know, you can also have NEPA violations where they've made a consultation error, which we don't have here, or there are situations where you have a scoping -- or, you know, the -- the segmentation problem, where they break up a project into a bunch of little projects and only do EAs and not EISs. So, like, there still would be a role for NEPA in this kind of narrower view, but I -- I do think that sort of historical perspective is important because, when NEPA was first passed, there were very few substantive environmental statutes, and so it was really designed to make sure that the agencies weren't heedless of the environmental consequences. Now, with all these substantive environmental statutes, I don't think an agency could possibly be -- be heedless of the environmental consequences.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Barrett?\n\nJudge:\nSo this dovetails with Justice Kavanaugh's questions. I mean, NEPA's a procedural statute. And, as you mentioned, now, with the amendments, we've shrunk down to pretty significant page limits, and now you're looking in the neighborhood of 150, and you have judicially enforceable deadlines.\n\nSo you have shrinking from the thousands of pages, like the report in this case. What effect do you think those procedural requirements are? I mean, it's going to be impossible for agencies to consider as many downstream and upstream effects as they did in this case just because of the procedural constraints. So what are -- what can we add? Or do you see that -- I mean, obviously, this case happened before the amendment.\n\nBut what can this add to that, or how can it dovetail with that when we have an eye looking forward to, you know, the amendments?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah.\n\nAnd I suppose, if you remanded here for additional NEPA analysis, that would be subject to the statute.\n\nSo I think the statute is highly relevant. I mean, I -- you know, I view the fact that it slimmed things down as a feature, not a bug.\n\nAnd I think, you know, to me, what would be most useful is reaffirming the principle that this Court has already said, which is, you know, the purpose of this thing is largely to inform the agency. But, in the context of NEPA in particular, what it should be informing the agency about are the environmental qualities of the reasonable alternatives that they're supposed to consider.\n\nAnd the CEQ itself is called the heart of the EIS, is the analysis of the reasonable alternatives and the mitigation measures. And all of that is going to be naturally focused on the project at hand, and all of that is like -- 150 pages ought to be pretty good to tell you that, yeah, Route 3 is better than Route 2, and Route 3 will be even better if you adopt the following however many mitigation measures. All of that, I think, can make a 150-page EIS still be valuable and, frankly, probably more valuable than a 3600-page EIS.\n\nJudge:\nA follow-up on the proximate cause questions you've already answered. I mean, I had taken your brief to take a harder line on proximate cause than you have today, so are you soft-pedaling proximate cause? Would it be -- it's hard for me to see when I think about how an opinion would write if you win.\n\nYou know, is it you start with proximate cause and then you ask: Well, should we go a little bit beyond this, maybe applying a rule of reason? So -- or are you still kind of pushing -- maybe I misoverread your brief.\n\nAre you pushing for a harder proximate cause line?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo, I mean, I -- I think, as -- as -- I'd go where this Court went, which is proximate cause maybe isn't the alpha and omega, but it sure is helpful.\n\nJudge:\nMm-hmm.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAnd then I -- I do think, having, you know, ruminated on the question a fair bit, that maybe the best thing that you could say is: If it is remote in time or space, which gets at proximate cause principles, and in the jurisdiction of another agency, then you're outside the consultation requirement and you're -- you're talking about something that if things go wrong years from now, the STB and this project is not going to be the legally relevant cause. You know, maybe it'll be poor management by the Federal Railroad Administration or the wrong speed limit in Colorado.\n\nOr maybe it'll be because Port Arthur, Texas, actually likes having refineries because it's the best thing for their local economy.\n\nBut you're not going to say 88 miles of track in northeastern Utah is the legally relevant cause.\n\nJudge:\nSo you see it as saying what we've said before but maybe putting a little bit more flesh on the bone with your \"remote in time and place\" language as kind of the measure of when you go beyond proximate cause? Is that how you would think of it?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah, and -- but I would emphasize that if it's in the jurisdiction of another agency and -- and remote --\n\nJudge:\nMm-hmm.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- that really means it's not the legally relevant cause because another way to explain the split --\n\nJudge:\nMm-hmm.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- is, you know, some people look at Public Citizen and they get just what I've told you out of Public Citizen. Other people look at Public Citizen and they say either that's a case about the president or they say that's a case where the last agency to act had no discretion whatsoever. And I think that way narrows what Public Citizen should stand for. So, in -- in a sense, if -- if -- if you make clear that Public Citizen and its test for the legally relevant cause really looks to another agency that's in a better position to regulate it and not -- it's not just, like, a ticket for, you know, one train --\n\nJudge:\nMm-hmm.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- sorry, the pun -- then -- then I think that will have a lot of help.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I mean, the prohibited purpose here is treating gender dysphoria, which is to say that the prohibited purpose is something about whether or not one is identifying with one's own sex or another sex.\n\nThe whole thing is imbued with sex.\n\nI mean, it's based on sex.\n\nYou might have reasons for thinking that it's an appropriate regulation, and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it's a dodge to say that this is not based on sex, it's based on medical purpose, when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nJustice, we think that is a slightly -- we think that's a request for a substantive right to engage in non-conforming behavior.\n\nWe don't think it's actually drawing a line based on sex.\n\nAnd, again, the only way that my friends can point to a sex-based line is to conflate the use of puberty blockers to address precocious puberty with the use of puberty blockers to transition.\n\nAnd those are fundamentally different treatments.\n\nThey have different effects on the body.\n\nThey're used for different purposes.\n\nI -- I actually think my -- my friends' response to -- to Justice Alito's hypothetical regarding puberty blockers is devastating because that law draws no different lines than the law that's drawn in our -- in SB1.\n\nIt just doesn't use the words \"inconsistent with sex.\" So we use the words \"inconsistent with sex\" to describe a single prohibited medical purpose.\n\nWe do not use it to draw lines between males and females.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, I want to be clear about this.\n\nI assume you agree with me that no matter how difficult the science may be and no matter how evolving it may be, at the end of the day, legislation on this subject is subject to judicial review?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nIs that correct? And I also want to be clear that the issue about the difficulty of regulating the science and attempting to figure out where to sort of stop and place the scale in -- in the evolution is a matter that goes to the level of judicial review, is that right, the level of the scrutiny that's applied?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nPlaintiff:\nCounselor, given your argument, you're saying your state can block gender treatment for adults too?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, we think that if we're assuming a similarly worded statute, that there still would not be a -- a sex- or a transgender-based classification.\n\nSo we think that --\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo you're -- you're licensing states to deprive grown adults of the choice of which sex to adopt?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, I don't think that's a fair character- --\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat's -- that's what you're telling me because you're saying to me rational basis would be the review for that kind of law for adults as well.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAnd this Court has not hesitated to hold laws unconstitutional under rational basis review when they are rooted in unsubstantiated fears and prejudices.\n\nThat's exactly what this Court did in Cleburne.\n\nAnd to the extent --\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat's quite an interesting way to protect a population.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAnd to the extent, Your Honor --\n\nPlaintiff:\nI thought that that's why we had intermediate scrutiny when there are differences based on sex, to ensure that states were not acting on the basis of prejudice.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, Your Honor, of course, we -- our position is that there is no sex-based classification, but, to -- to finish the answer, that to the extent that -- that there -- a law dealing with adults would pass rational basis review, that just means it's left to the democratic process and that democracy is the best check on potentially misguided laws.\n\nJudge:\nSo when --\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhen you're 1 percent of the population.\n\nJudge:\nSorry.\n\nPlaintiff:\nWhen you're 1 percent of the population or less, very hard to see how the democratic process is going to protect you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, Your Honor --\n\nPlaintiff:\nYou -- blacks were a much larger part of the population, and it didn't protect them.\n\nIt didn't protect women for whole centuries.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I thought the --there was a second purpose, which was to ensure that defendants knew what they were defending against.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That -- that's right.\r\n\r\nIt is also --so there's -- there's -- I think the -- the --some of the amicus briefs on Respondents' side point out that, in general, particularity requirements are to assist with notice.\r\n\r\nAnd so I think that's there. And -- and maybe just, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, to return to your question, if what we're talking about is the frivolous, that it's more than --this is more -- this is doing more than Rule 11, I would certainly agree with you there.\r\n\r\nJudge: Counsel, you've ended answering me, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Oh, sure.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge: If the dissent had been the majority, what problems would have been created going forward from your perspective?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If the dissent had been the majority, I -- I think, honestly, what we have is a -- is a disagreement on the facts that I -- I --I think --\r\n\r\nJudge: So that goes to your answer to Justice Barrett's question it sounds like then?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nI mean, I -- I -- I think that it would have a profound effect on this case, but I'm not sure that it would set bad law going forward. I think that -- just to -- to touch on a few things very briefly that had already come up, in terms of how to handle expert reports, Justice Alito, I think you said that it may be difficult for district courts to know what to do with these very technical sets of facts that you'll find in expert reports.\r\n\r\nThat's going to be the same problem if they're not in expert reports, and they might even be more confusing because I think, if you have plaintiffs' lawyers trying to articulate a bunch of highly technical facts, it might come out a little bit more garbled.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that's a particular reason to adopt a special --a special rule, and the PSLRA does not. Justice Kavanaugh, I think you asked about the Ninth Circuit applying different rules, and I really don't think that they are.\r\n\r\nAnd the best evidence perhaps of this is that Anderson, the case that Petitioners cite and rely on as doing it right, is repeatedly relying on Ninth Circuit precedent. And I'd also note that the district court decision, which, again, Petitioners are relying on, that also is repeatedly relying on Ninth Circuit decisions.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think this is a case where the court of appeals has gone rogue and is doing anything different than the other -- the other courts of appeals here. And in terms of the slide, the main thing that I want to say there is that the -- the Ninth Circuit did address the slide.\r\n\r\nI think that, you know, this Court is not a court of factual analysis, but if you're concerned that the Ninth Circuit just wasn't doing things, the -- there's many pages of analysis from 48a to 55a explaining that they were examining that.\r\n\r\nAnd -- and, similarly, there's many pages of analysis examining the detailed factual allegations underlying the expert report.\r\n\r\nThat's 20a to 22a. So unless there are further questions?\r\n\r\nJudge: Anything further? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Katyal.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nFive points. First, Mr. Gupta said that particularity requires detail.\r\n\r\nWe quite agree.\r\n\r\nYet the Ninth Circuit said that this complaint had enough detail. This is why you need to reverse.\r\n\r\nIt's dangerous to say this amount of detail is enough for a complaint. That's not a change in our position.\r\n\r\nThey're the ones -- I'll explain that in a moment -- but they're the ones changing their position.\r\n\r\nThey are running away from the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit's decision said that the CEO \"would have reflected their expert opinion\" and does not engage in any sort of comparative analysis. 42a is not a comparative analysis.\r\n\r\nThey -- the Ninth Circuit never even bothered answering our competing hypothesis, which was the pricing explanation.\r\n\r\nYou have to reverse that.\r\n\r\nAnd as the amici say, otherwise, you're letting circuit courts let decisions --let litigants provide these cases and state a claim without a comparative inquiry. And you certainly have to reject their new idea that these employees are enough because they don't indicate when the CEO knew something.\r\n\r\nWas it after or before that watershed SKU event? Nothing said that they -- they do say that the CEO actually saw the data at the time.\r\n\r\nThe best they have is a video that was taken from 2012, well before the class period. And Mr. -- and Judge Sanchez explains at 62a why that slide is so devastating.\r\n\r\nAnd he also explains at 82a why not a single employee ever said the CEO saw anything damaging during the class period. You can't let this stand for the reasons the amici say.\r\n\r\nCongress in the Reform Act, as the Chief Justice indicated, wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allow fraud by -- fraud by hindsight.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

My point is that where the thing that has to recur is that an individual poses a threat of engaging in one of four enumerated acts of terrorism, that a court should hold is just not likely to recur --\n\nJudge: But doesn't -- but aren't you skipping over the government's assessment of whether or not that's happening and the basis upon which the government is making that assessment? So this is what I mean, right?

But, here, we have two additional things.\nOne, the Courtright declaration that we were just reading makes clear that he was removed from the list not just as a matter of grace or because, you know, we wanted to moot out the litigation, but he was removed from the list because he substantively didn't satisfy the criteria anymore.\nAnd that, under the presumption of good faith and national security, is entitled to respect as, you know, and -- and absent some strong showing of bad faith. And then, second, the Courtright declaration says: And we're not going to reconsider this decision because you won't be put back on the No Fly List based on the currently available information.\nSo it adds a stickiness to that determination.\nSo it's not a matter of grace, and it's sticky and so isn't likely going to be revoked in the future.\n\nJudge: All right.\nLet me ask you about the standing question real quick. Does the government dispute that the plaintiff had standing at the time that he filed his suit in 2013?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: All right.\nSo he did.\nAnd don't we ordinarily assess standing at the time the person brings the lawsuit? If you have standing to bring -- to file the lawsuit, then, to the extent your circumstances change, we now move into the realm of evaluating it under mootness, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct, but I'll point out that Already, which was a case about mootness, did mention that, you know, in these circumstances where the -- the claim is no longer really live, that cases like Lyons and Article III apply with equal force, that a litigant cannot just rely on speculative injuries to keep the case alive. So mootness and standing should not be interpreted to be that different from each other because both are implementing Article III's case or controversy requirement.\nAnd that's why, as I was mentioning to another judge earlier, I think, we -- we shouldn't interpret the two exceptions to -- to mootness that make it more flexible than standing unmoored from the purposes for which those exceptions were developed, which was really evasion of judicial review and, in particular, with voluntary cessation.\n\nJudge: But isn't -- isn't -- I mean, Justice Scalia suggested that the voluntary cessation exception really is about whether or not the case is moot to begin with. It's not as though we're accepting that it's moot under a circumstance in which the government takes him off the No Fly List and then we're looking at is there an exception to mootness in this situation.\nInstead, we're saying has the government actually mooted the case when it takes him off the No Fly List, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I'm not sure about that.\nI mean, Justice Scalia dissented in Friends of the Earth.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "479", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer: Your Honor, I think they do. I think my friend almost conceded that they do by saying, if they had moved for summary judgment on day one—\n\nJudge: This is not—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —they probably would have had their car back sooner.\n\nJudge: This is not the—the Barker factors have three—they have all government interests focused on—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I would dispute that, Your Honor. The length of delay clearly takes into account the interests of the private party.\nBeing deprived of your car for 14 days is a less significant deprivation than being deprived for 400 days. So there is a way—\n\nJudge: No, but you're still building in massive delay. How about three months when it's hardship?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, you're—you're assuming that Barker—\n\nJudge: Where—where does that go—where does that go into the Barker factors?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, there may be circumstances where Barker needs to be applied with more teeth, but I don't think that means it's not up to the task.\n\nJudge: Well, but why don't you see the Mathews factors as that more teeth?\nMathews is just more explicit of adding in the—I guess, in this case, the Petitioners' factors.\nBarker seems to be with timing and seeing who caused the timing, what were the government's interests.\nThe government interest is always going to be great, but where does Barker take into account the hardship of the individual?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I—I think, again, you—you get in front of a judge quickly, the judge can do—he can move the case up faster. And this is the advantage of Barker. My friend suggested that Mathews—\n\nJudge: The disadvantage is that that process is very discretionary.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think one disadvantage is that it asks federal judges to try to project into the future what the next typical thousand forfeiture cases are going to be like. When we're dealing with cars and guns and cash and pirate ships—\n\nJudge: Well, I—I want to—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —there is no typical case.\n\nJudge: I'd like you to point out to me one of these cases involving guns, money, or—what were the other—putting cars aside. Money, cars, and—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There are a lot of older cases involving pirate ships.\n\nJudge: Pirate ships. In which of those cases were those things released immediately after a retention hearing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think—I think that's the point, Your Honor, they haven't been at history.\n\nJudge: They haven't been because, as I mentioned, people involved with guns, people involved with money, people involved with other things rarely want to come into court for a retention hearing if they have a criminal proceeding in place.\nThe people who come in are the people who are innocent owners.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, I think a claim like that would need to come from my friends and would need to be backed up with—with evidence.\nAnd it's not uncommon, as this Court has—as courts have recognized, that criminals oftentimes do put title of property in someone else's name, and that someone else can come forward.\nNot every purportedly innocent owner is innocent, and not everyone is even an owner.\n\nAnd this is another problem with rushing this hearing, is that someone could come forward and claim ownership but not actually have proper ownership.\nAnd if it's happening too quickly, then the actually innocent owner may be out his property and it's not going to be there at the final forfeiture hearing, which is why the government has always had this authority to seize before a hearing, and the same interests that have long justified seizure before a hearing justify not turning the stuff back over immediately after the seizure but, rather, holding it until you can have a prompt but accurate final hearing.\n\nJudge: General, can I ask you to respond to Petitioners' argument that the historical analogs are not actually analogous here and that we don't have any settled tradition of having a single forfeiture hearing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I would expect to have seen a mini-trial or a remission—or not remission—a retention hearing somewhere in the history, but we do not have that.\nAnd if you contrast that with the liberty interest, past cases highlight how there always was this right at common law to be presented to the magistrate right after the arrest.\n\nBut there's not similar evidence when it comes to property, and that's because property and liberty are very different. The liberty interest—\n\nJudge: But there are new kinds of property that arise and there are new kinds of procedures and that things have shifted and maybe the final hearing itself happened in much closer proximity to the seizure. That was Petitioners' suggestion.\nSo, you know, what do we do then if we think there is no precise analog?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If it—I think you're still speaking in the language of speed, which is the language of Barker, which is, again, why we think Barker is the test.\nIt is the historical test. It carries that forward to today, institute promptly, conclude promptly, and then let the judges who are on the ground with the parties in front of them weigh those—weigh those competing interests.\n\nAnd when it comes to this affirmative defense of innocent ownership, I don't think that changes things at all. It's actually very similar to the argument that Mr. Von Neumann made.\nHe said he had an independent interest in this remission petition. And the court did assume for purposes of deciding part 3 that he did. And the court said, we don't see how that separate interest, apart from the cars, is in any way prejudiced by this 36-day wait.\n\nAnd the same thing is true here. This separate interest apart from the cars in raising an affirmative defense is prejudiced not at all by being held or being heard for the first time at the final hearing as opposed to two weeks after seizure or two days after seizure for that matter.\n\nAnd if you look to the criminal context, there are affirmative defenses there that typically don't get heard until the criminal trial. So, clearly, affirmative defenses can be meaningful even if they don't get put before a court until the final hearing. And the same thing is true in the civil context.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, what is the affirmative—what—what is—your conception of this—the interest that this Petitioner is raising is the ability to make her affirmative defense early? I don't understand where affirmative defense came from.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They say that this case is somehow different because there's now an innocent owner affirmative defense, but, I mean, that same argument was pressed by Mr. Von Neumann when it came to the remission petition.\nHe said, I have this independent right created by federal law to get a remission petition decision, and the Court said that right received all the process it was due by this 36-day process in deciding.\n\nThe same thing is true here. Their right to claim innocent ownership was heard and was vindicated at the final hearing.\nThere's no need for it to be heard two days or two weeks after seizure in order for it to comport with fundamental fairness.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "910", "dialogue": "Judge: Some of our cases have suggested that the reason we have a clear statement rule is to, in this area, prevent the waiver of sovereign immunity accidentally. You know, that there has to be—it can't be through inadvertence that Congress has waived sovereign immunity. So you could look at this statute and especially the q problem and so forth and say that the waiver was accidental, it was inadvertent, and that's exactly what the clear statement rule tries to prevent. So what would be your best counter to that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I have two counters. One is about statutory interpretation. One is FCRA-specific.\nThe first one is I don't see how you have a workable principle of statutory interpretation that looks behind clear text to say, did Congress really mean this?\nSo, for example, if the 1996 Act had reenacted the definition of \"person\" word for word, if the committee report had said we're doing this because we want to make clear the government is liable, the words of the U.S. Code would be exactly the same. But under a rule that looks behind the text, the outcome would be completely different.\nAnd the FCRA-specific argument is—I mean, here, you have a situation, as I mentioned in my opening, Congress didn't just sort of make a single amendment to the FCRA. It amended the civil liability provision to extend to persons in Section 2412 of the 1996 amendment. On the very next page, in the very next section, 2413, it used the word \"person\" to extend furnisher obligations onto those who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.\nAnd I think it's fairly implausible that when Congress turned the page, it somehow, using the same word, intended a different definition of the term to apply.\n\nJudge: Could I ask you a couple of questions about Employees? First, suppose that Employees had decided the very issue that is before us now. Would you say that we should disregard it because it used an outmoded method of statutory interpretation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, if Employees had decided the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I think there was an argument for statutory stare decisis that might still apply to the FLSA, but since that doesn't apply here, I think the Court should and has in the past—in the case of implied causes of action—rejected prior methods of interpretation that had become outmoded.\n\nJudge: And was that a \"yes\" or a \"no\"?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: Or maybe?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —may have lost the thought on the original question, but I—\n\nJudge: Yeah. If it involved the very question that is before us now—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —would—do you think we should—we would disregard it, or we should disregard it because we disagree with the method of statutory interpretation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If it's the very question in a different statute, my answer would be the same. The Court should not follow Employees and should instead read the statute the way it currently reads statutes.\n\nJudge: Okay. I think you went into my second question. Suppose that the statute is different, but the structure—the wording and the structure in all relevant respects is the same. Do you think we should disregard it because of its method of statutory interpretation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, I think you should. Now, when you say the same, there are a lot of differences between the statute there and here, but just to answer your hypothetical, you shouldn't follow a method of interpretation that you had rejected previously in construing a new statute.\n\nJudge: There are a lot of important decisions from the 1970s and the 1980s that use a method of statutory interpretation that is probably not the one that we would use if those questions came before us today. You think we should just disregard all those? They're all fair game? Are they all fair game?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it's open to litigants to argue that the Court should—the statutes say something different.\n\nJudge: Well, the answer to that question has got to be no, right?\n[Laughter.]\nI mean, we're not going to throw out all our precedents because we've decided that there's a better way to interpret statutes.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No. No, that's right. I mean, I'm not talking about an over—\n\nJudge: So you have to be saying that this is a different statute, and you are saying that it has a different structure, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I'm saying both of those things. Maybe I misunderstood the hypothetical.\n\nJudge: I didn't think you said it had a different structure. I thought you said that the methodology used—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, the statute had—\n\nJudge: —a methodology—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the statute has a different structure because, in Employees, the government could still enforce the FLSA against states. That was an important part of the Employees decision.\n\nJudge: What do you do—you've treated Employees as if it's this one-off outlier, but then, in subsequent cases, like Union Gas, it seems like the same principles, accepted by all nine justices there, were used. In other words, the specific reference to states in the original Act in Union Gas, the Court goes out of its way to say that alone—in the definitional provisions—that alone would not have been good enough to do it and cites Employees.\nAnd then, in College Savings Bank, the Court makes a big point that Employees started the retreat from Parden, which was a much looser standard for waiver of sovereign immunity. So it's not an out—you know, it's not just that this case has never been cited again.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It hasn't been cited for the statutory interpretation point, I think, until—in any subsequent case since the late '80s. I think, in Union Gas, you're correct, the statute was written differently. There was additional language in the definitions section that was dispositive to the Court's analysis there.\nSo the Court didn't have to sort of reach out and try to address the question the Court might have to address here, which is how viable is that sort of method of interpretation.\n\nJudge: By method of interpretation—I just want to get back to this because it mentions the text and it mentions this principle that we don't lightly interpret the text to waive sovereign immunity. And then there's nothing else that would suggest—in the history of it—that a waiver was intended either. I don't—that sounds like an opinion you could write now and has been written now.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, there's nothing in Employees that grapples with why the statutory definition in that case did not meet the clear statement standard.\n\nJudge: I thought it said because the reference to government, to public employers, was not in the cause of action provision.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "580", "dialogue": "**Judge:**\r\nLet me take both parts of your question, Justice Barrett.\r\n\r\nLet me start with your -- the -- the last part, the title clause.\r\n\r\nAnd I think the -- the title clause clarifies that the False Claims Act applies even if the United States no longer has title, present tense, to the money or property when the request is made.\r\n\r\nSo a request for money that's been provided to -- by the United States to a grantee is still a claim even though the grantee and not the United States holds title to the money when the request is made.\r\n\r\nAnd the -- the revised addition of the \"provides for\" clause strengthens that interpretation because Congress also amended that to say \"provides or has provided.\" So it's really a timing issue.\r\n\r\nAnd I would think, if Congress -- if Congress were going to sever the link between the False Claims Act and protecting the public fisc that has been its historic focus, it would not have done that -- it would not have taken that huge step through such an oblique way as to revising the title clause, which really is more about timing and doesn't sever the link between the public fisc and the FCA.\r\n\r\nAnd, Justice Barrett, let me take on your second question -- your second aspect of your question about the government -- the purpose and the interest here, and that gets back to what I was talking with Justice Jackson about.\r\n\r\nAnd the text of the False Claims Act really answers that because, in the revised -- in the revisions, the amendments that were made in 2009, Congress specified: If the money or property is to be spent or used on the government's behalf or to advance a government program or interest and if the United States provides or has provided any portion of the money.\r\n\r\nSo, if -- if Congress wanted to sever this historic link between the False Claims Act and protecting the public fisc, the easiest way for it to do that would have been just to eliminate the \"provides\" clause altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd Congress didn't -- didn't do that. It adopted a very narrow amendment --\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nDo --\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\n-- that was focused on the timing issue, not severing the -- the False Claims Act from the --\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nOn -- on Justice Thomas's question about the hundred million dollars -- I want to focus on that as well for a minute -- what exactly makes something part of the public fisc, to use your terms, or makes something government funds, to use your term? What are the precise indicia?\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nI would say public money, money that is owed to the United States. So that would take in taxes, certainly, but also fees, say, that people pay the post office or customs that go into the public fisc. So I think the key -- the key -- the key indicia is that it's simply money that the government owns.\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nFrom taxes or fees or fines? No?\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nIf the money -- if it's -- if it's -- if it's money that's going from private pockets into the public fisc, into the government, the government owns that money and the government can do with that money what it will.\r\n\r\nAnd by contrast --\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nWhen you say \"owns the money,\" what are --\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\nOwns the money.\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\n-- what are the precise things we look at to determine whether the government \"owns the money\"?\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nI think -- I think you would -- I think one way -- maybe one helpful way to look at it within --\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nAnd, again, I'm focused on the hundred million here.\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nMaybe one helpful way to look at it within the False Claims Act context that our case arises in is it is -- it is money that -- that, if anything were to happen to that money, right, that that -- that -- that the -- the incidence of that loss would be borne by the government.\r\n\r\nAnd, in our case, whether you're talking about the contributions or you're talking about the debt, the settlement, the restitution, all of which is owed to the Administrative Company, all of which is being paid by the private carriers, and the government's role, as this Court said in the Cohn case, right, money or property that is just in the government's hands for temporary possession before it's being returned to its rightful owner is not public money or public funds or endangering the public fisc --\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\nBut couldn't you say that --\r\n\r\n**Judge:**\r\n-- for purposes of the False Claims Act.\r\n\r\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:**\r\n-- about all public funds?

He, presumably, would say no.\nAnd are you saying—are you stating an opinion about whether this individual knew she had drugs in the car? He would have to say no, right? So I don't understand—I mean, obviously, you would like a case in which this was a very rare occurrence, but all he's saying is that it's not.\nIt's whatever he wants to say, in the majority of cases or whatever, and you can challenge that and you can particularly make clear that what the concern was about in drafting this rule, you can make clear that he is not telling you anything about this particular individual.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Let me say two things about that, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, I just want to return to the thing I said in the opening, which is, if the expert were to testify that I think there's an 80 percent chance this particular defendant had the mens rea, the same kind of cross-examination could occur.\nYou would say, Mr. Expert, you're not sure, are you? It's possible he didn't have it? Only—you know, it's only you're saying probably? And I think it would be very hard to argue Rule 704(b) would not cover that testimony.\n\nJudge: Well, I don't think—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And the reason why—\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Oh.\nI think the reason why is because what the drafters of the rule cared about was not an absolute versus probabilistic opinion.\nWhat they cared about was the expert assigning a mens rea to the defendant or a class of people like the defendant.\nIn other words, it's the subject of mens rea that's off limits, not—\n\nJudge: Well, I don't know that—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —absolute testimony.\n\nJudge: I—I certainly don't have experience in—in trials, but—but I don't know that—could he really say there's an 80 percent chance that this individual had drugs? I think he would have to say more generally that 80 percent of the people that I've studied or whatever have drugs.\nI don't know that he can ascribe—maybe he shouldn't be able to ascribe a number to this individual.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well—well—\n\nJudge: Because there may well be situations where—and, again, the defense counsel can bring them up—why this person would not be like the typical individual that the expert—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: —is testifying about.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, after Rule 704(b), of course, the expert couldn't, but I think, before Rule 704(b), an expert could say—for example, an expert could say, absolutely, as happened in the Hinckley trial, I believe this defendant did not have the capacity to tell right from wrong, so, therefore, he is insane.\nAnd I think after—and I think Congress would have prohibited that in Rule 704(b) just like it would prohibit the expert from saying I think most likely Mr. Hinckley was insane and couldn't tell right from wrong.\nAnd whether you say that in terms of a percentage or just a verbal locution that's \"probably,\" \"usually,\" \"most of the time,\" \"almost certainly,\" any of those things would be covered by the rule because they're all an opinion about whether the defendant had that mens rea.\n\nJudge: But, Mr.—\n\nJudge: Mr.—\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer—\n\nJudge: —Mr. Lawyer, the—the Ninth Circuit's rule is clear.\nYour rule, to my mind, is unclear.\nI still don't understand it.\nIf you don't think that anything from which the jury could infer mens rea is barred by 704, then I don't know where you draw the line.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I think it might help to understand what you have to decide in this case if I give you a quick preface to that answer.\n\nJudge: Well, just give me what the rule should be.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The rule should be that any testimony that the jury would naturally understand as expressing an opinion about the defendant's mens rea is covered by Rule 704(b).\n\nJudge: So that—if it's—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That raises—\n\nJudge: —if it's relevant—all right.\nSuppose the—suppose the—the expert is—is asked, how many cases do you have personal familiarity with in which a person drove across the border with a large quantity of drugs hidden in the car? Eighty-three cases.\nAnd how many of those cases did the person driving the car know that the drugs were there? Eighty-three. Is that barred?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that would be barred because it would be equivalent of saying defendants in this position always have the requisite mens rea.\n\nJudge: Well, it's just a statement of fact about his—about his—what he has personal knowledge of.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, remember, the state—the expert testimony here—and this is at Pet. App. 13A—was admitted as an expert opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite mens rea.\nIt's opinion evidence—\n\nJudge: All right.\nWell, this isn't—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —not facts evidence.\n\nJudge: Okay.\nSo it would be okay if it's not opinion evidence?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think it functionally would be opinion evidence regardless of whether you characterized it.\nBut, Your Honor, let me—I think it might help the conversation if I explained the Ninth Circuit's rule raises really two questions.\nOne is, is the expert testimony about mens rea and is it about the defendant?\nAnd—and—and we agree with the—with the Fifth Circuit rule that if you—if the expert gives testimony that—from which the jury can merely draw an inference about mens rea, that's perfectly fine, and there might be borderline cases about what's mens rea, but that's not this case because the expert used the word \"know.\"\nThe expert used the word \"aware.\"\n\nJudge: Well, can I test that—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the only question—\n\nJudge: —that question about inference?\nSo suppose that the expert gets on the stand and says: In my experience, drug traffickers always inform their carriers before they head out about the nature of the scheme.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Would that come under your rule or would it not?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think it would probably barely fall outside of our rule, Your Honor, and that's—but you have identified an edge case, but the reason—\n\nJudge: Yeah, it's—it's—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —why it wouldn't fall in—\n\nJudge: —very much like—I—I sort of expected—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —you to say that—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "98", "dialogue": "Judge: When a plaintiff brings a Section 1983 malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, the plaintiff must show that the alleged malicious prosecution resulted in the plaintiff's seizure, as this Court held in Thompson. The Sixth Circuit correctly concluded that the plaintiff cannot make that showing because probable cause supported his detention.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The plaintiff was arrested and detained for three days pursuant to a warrant supported by probable cause for two first-degree misdemeanor crimes, each carrying a sentence of up to six months imprisonment. In light of that, the presence of a third charge, allegedly lacking probable cause, could not have resulted in the plaintiff's detention.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This result flows directly from existing Fourth Amendment precedents, including Devenpeck v.

I think what has happened is that the plaintiff has created this any-crime rule that was, in fact, a rule that the Sixth Circuit had not adopted.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Under this any-crime straw man rule, it would mean that the presence of one charge supported by probable cause automatically justifies any detention. I don't think that's what the Sixth Circuit thought.\n\nJudge: What do I do with the language of the court that says, moreover, we can affirm the district court's decision if probable cause supports one or more of the three charges?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I realize that. I would again point the Court to the paragraph that I referenced because that's where they articulate the standard. And if there's anything that might be somewhat unsatisfactory about the lower court opinion, it's that they are joining together the false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution analyses.\n\nJudge: So do you disagree with the Solicitor General that if -- I don't know how we get to this proof, but assuming it could be made -- that absent the felony charge, no arrest warrant would have issued?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh, no. I absolutely --\n\nJudge: A summons would have issued? Do you think then that it's an unreasonable seizure to have gotten the warrant?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I disagree. And that’s not the way Fourth Amendment precedents operate in this area. We look at the detention and we ask whether it is objectively justified.\n\nJudge: So what makes -- a seizure can be permitted but the detention unreasonable.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Absolutely. And I think that might arise in circumstances where a particular offense is maybe a fine-only offense, for example, and that's the only charge that can provide probable cause.\n\nJudge: Just to get back to the question that was asked about that language, I understand that you're saying we shouldn’t take that language at face value, but if that language were taken at face value to mean that any crime gets you out of liability, you do disagree with that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If it meant an any-crime rule the way the plaintiff defines it, that any probable cause automatically insulates any detention, yes, we agree that would be incorrect.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If, however, you look at the Sixth Circuit opinion and you disagree and you think that is the standard that the Sixth Circuit applied, then we think you should announce the right rule. And we, I think, largely agree with the United States about what that rule is.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But we also think you should apply it in this case. There’s ample precedent for doing that in Crawford, Employment Division v. Smith, Terry v. United States, and Katz v. United States, and we think that would be appropriate to do here.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "239", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-971, Waetzig versus Halliburton Energy Services.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As ever -- every Federal Circuit to have considered the question held until the decision below, Rule 41 voluntary dismissals without prejudice may be reopened under Rule 60(b) because they are final proceedings or final judgments.\n\nTo start, a voluntary dismissal is a proceeding or a judgment.\n\nThe phrase \"judgment, order, or proceeding\" in Rule 60(b) was taken in 1937 from Section 473 of California's Code of Civil Procedure, and at the time, California's Supreme Court had interpreted Section 473 to cover all steps in litigation and had --it had specifically applied Section 473 to voluntary dismissals.\n\nThese authoritative California decisions were carried into Rule 60(b), and they are consistent with dictionary definitions of the terms \"proceeding\" and \"judgment.\" Next, a voluntary dismissal is also final.\n\nSome courts, after adoption of the rule, initially read it to constrain their authority to revise interlocutory matters.\n\nAnd the advisory committee thought this was wrong, so it added the word \"final\" to confirm that Rule 60(b) comes into play only when a court lacks inherent authority to modify a matter as interlocutory.\n\nBut a dismissal terminates a case, so it cannot be modified using a court -- the court's inherent power, and it is, therefore, final for Rule 60(b) purposes.\n\nAnd that conclusion, again, is confirmed by contemporaneous dictionary definitions.\n\nPlaintiff:\nDidn't the Tenth Circuit also treat this as jurisdictional?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThe -- the Tenth Circuit treated the decision -- the issue of whether Rule 60(b) could be -- whether the case could be reopened as going to the jurisdiction of the court to vacate the award, and, therefore, there are two, effectively, threshold issues that could be resolved.\n\nAnd, under Sinochem, of course, there's no sequencing to jurisdictional issues, which is, I think, the point that Justice Gorsuch made in the dissent that we cite in our briefs, where, if there are two jurisdictional issues and the court grant --or two issues that are threshold and go to a court's jurisdiction and the court grants review to decide one of them, it should decide that question, and the other jurisdictional issues or issues going to jurisdiction remain for remand.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo do you agree that it's jurisdictional, or is it simply an application of 60(b)?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI --I do not agree that it's jurisdictional.\n\nI think it's a -- it's a -- it's about the application of Rule 60(b), and if relief is granted, then the case is reopened and there is jurisdiction.\n\nBut the question that is itself presented I would characterize as a threshold issue in the same way as, in Sinochem, forum non conveniens was a threshold issue which was not jurisdictional.\n\nJudge:\nYour -- your friend suggests that the reason that you're going through this process after voluntarily dismissing the case, now trying to revive it, it's an ADEA claim that you lost in arbitration, and it's a way to try to bring a collateral attack on the arbitration award.\n\nIs that --is that what's going on?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, there was a motion to -- to reopen the case and to vacate the award, and the case was then sent back to arbitration.\n\nSo it was -- the motion was a challenge to the arbitration award.\n\nPlaintiff:\nBut isn't it a separate motion?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt was -- it was -- it --\n\nPlaintiff:\nI mean, there's a motion to vacate, but there's also a motion to reopen, and the court would have to make two independent determinations regarding that, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThe district court treated it as two issues, entered two orders.\n\nThey are both attached to our petition.\n\nThe first order chronologically was to reopen the case under Rule 60(b).\n\nAnd then later, having reopened the case, the court vacated the arbitration award.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd, here, we're just concerned about the propriety of the first issue?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\nWell, your friend on the other side is concerned about a little more than that.\n\nHe says --I mean, what is the reason for what you're doing if not to collaterally attack the arbitration award?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I think that goes to the -- I agree the motion was filed and the reopening was done to vacate the award.\n\nThose are -- those go to the -- to two different -- they don't go --those issues do not go to the question presented.\n\nThey go to, number one, whether the court was right to grant relief under Rule 60(b).\n\nI note that that issue was not addressed by the court itself in the majority opinion, although the dissent would have affirmed the district court's grant of relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nAnd so, on remand, my friends can argue that the 60(b) ruling, the exercise of discretion by the district court should be vacated as an abuse of discretion. And then, of course, there will be the separate issue on remand, to the extent arguments have been preserved, as to whether the separate order vacating the award should be affirmed.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nBut, I mean, I'm just trying to get a handle on why we're going through all this.\n\nAnd the arbitration award has been confirmed in court, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt has not been confirmed.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nBut there is a proceeding to do that, or are you challenging that independently?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThe -- what happened is there was an arbitration award.\n\nThen there was a motion filed by my client to reopen the case and vacate the award.\n\nAnd then that award was vacated.\n\nAnd then the matter was appealed.\n\nJudge:\nWell, then, so your friend is wrong to suggest that the reason -- I mean, the ADEA claim was resolved in the arbitration.\n\nNow, if it's going to be challenged, it should be challenged in that forum.\n\nNo?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, there's --there's a motion under -- arbitration awards would be subject to challenge under the FAA.\n\nAnd the court, the district court here, determined that those grounds were satisfied and that the arbitration award should be vacated and did vacate the award.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

The way the plaintiff in this case teed up the claim is whether or not they were receiving a hearing at a meaningful time.\n\nJudge: Not in this case. I'm talking about this case. The previous case—I agree with you that—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: —the previous case and another similar case were both about the timing—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: —because the Court says in the first sentence of the previous case that this is about the 36-month delay.\nBut are you saying that that's the only type of procedural due process violation that can occur with respect to civil forfeiture?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that's what the Court held, Your Honor. Again, the interest is the same—having the car and not being temporarily deprived of the vehicle. And that was the—\n\nJudge: No, not being permanently deprived of the vehicle is different from not being temporarily deprived of the vehicle, isn't it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right. But in the previous case, the complaint was about the temporary deprivation—\n\nJudge: Well, let—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —that you should—\n\nJudge: —let's put it this way. I mean, due process has various components, you'd agree, and one component is how quickly your claim can be heard. Another component would be what procedures your claim is going to be decided pursuant to, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So there's a substantive aspect to it—the wrong word, but the idea is that the procedure has to have some robustness to it, okay?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, for example, if I said, oh, I got a quick hearing, but I had to call between 3 and 5 p.m., and I had to speak to a specific person, but it turns out that person is on permanent vacation, okay? But I—I can get a quick hearing, I can get it the next day, but that's what I have to do to get it.\nOr I get it in front of a biased court, and the judge turns out to be wholly biased, for example, and I can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nThose would all be due process issues besides how quickly I got to court, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. So I—I get that a particular case is all about the Speedy Trial Act. It's right there in the title. It's all about timing. And that certainly is an important component of due process.\nBut I think the opposing counsel suggests that they're arguing more about the fairness of the process itself and what's happening around the country, as another judge pointed out—I'm not accusing this state of this, to be very clear.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. But there are arguments to be made that there are attempts to create processes that are deeply unfair and obviously so in order to retain the property for the state's benefit.\nAnd I think another judge is concerned that if we go down this road and just focus on timing, we're losing the capacity to address those cases.\nAm I putting it fairly?\n\nJudge: You're putting it fairly.\n\nJudge: Long-windedly but fairly, I hope.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

They did not allow spent nuclear fuel.\n\nSo, if you start with the baseline of there's a federal monopoly and no one can do any of this, and then you have three exceptions, you can't have a fourth exception.\n\nJudge: What about the idea that the 1954 Act arguably authorizes this; when you get down to 1980, the Commission says it does; 1982, Congress is very aware of this issue and certainly aware of the Commission -- where the Commission is on this and yet does not preclude it, and that's remained the settled understanding ever since? The basic same argument I asked Mr. Frederick.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: But that seems kind of an unusual step by Congress.\n\nThey -- they might not have had the votes to prohibit it in 1982, might be one -- one interpretation, big-picture interpretation of what happened there.\n\nDo you just want to respond to all that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Sure.\n\nSo, one, again, I would point the Court to 10155(h) and 10131(a)(3).\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nAnd if 10155(h) does not prohibit.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Okay.\n\nBut it is inexplicable under their view.\n\nBut I would also point the Court to the congressional brief, where they explain the early statements of the agency after the passage of the Policy Act, which I don't think are consistent with what we're hearing now.\n\nThere's also the time.\n\nWhat strikes me is, if we've always had this power, then why didn't -- why wasn't it until after the agency gave up on Yucca Mountain that suddenly you started getting these applications? It's very bizarre, it seems to me, that if there's always been this power and everybody understood this power exists, it wasn't until the agency said, oh, actually, we're not going to do Yucca Mountain, that suddenly they said, oh, let's go back to this power that's already existed.\n\nJudge: Wait a minute, because it was told it had to try everything else.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well --\n\nJudge: It was told in the 1982 Act that it wanted to encourage onsite -- the federal government to take it, et cetera. So it couldn't run to do something that Congress said: Try everything else.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\n\nAnd the fallback --\n\nJudge: And we've run out of everything else.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I disagree with that, Your Honor.\n\nBut the fallback that Congress said was federal facilities, federal facilities.\n\nAnd this goes back to the point that I think Justice Alito was making.\n\nWhat are the incentives for Congress here? If New Mexico and Texas are left holding the bag, every other state will be happy.\n\nThey will be pleased because this waste will stay in Texas forever.\n\nThe only way we're going to get a national solution to this problem is by Congress to get everybody there and figure it out.\n\nThey tried to do that with Yucca Mountain, and it didn't work.\n\nBut the answer isn't: Well, I guess we're just going to put it on Texas now.\n\nNo, Congress needs to go back and fix the law.\n\nIf the law is broken, it's on Congress, Congress to fix it.\n\nIt's not this Court's job, and it's not the agency's job.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I see my time's expired.\n\nJudge: Justice Thomas?

{"id": "469", "dialogue": "Judge:\n-- you don't appreciate a difference between the downline impacts of having more train traffic in certain areas versus what is being carried on those trains and what then happens to that cargo?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo I think the standard is foreseeability for both, but I do think that it will be much more rare for the trains to be carrying a single commodity for refining in a single -- for consumption in -- in a single location.\n\nThat, I think, is what makes this case, you know, a particularly unrepresentative example of -- of the foreseeability standard because, in many cases, as the D.C. Circuit acknowledged, the -- whatever the commodity is, whether it's on a train or in a pipeline, it will go into some national distribution network and no one will know where it will go, what will -- how it will be consumed, whether it will displace other goods.\n\nAnd I think the D.C. Circuit made -- made that point in distinguishing one of its own precedents involving natural gas. But, in this case, the -- the entire purpose of the project is to carry waxy crude oil, and the record before the agency shows that every train that leaves the Uinta Basin is going to be carrying waxy crude oil, every one.\n\nAnd the Board was able to quantify both the amount of oil that would be necessary to make the project financially viable and to identify where it would go. So, if the Board has essentially tracked the oil out of the basin onto the trains and to the refineries, what the D.C. Circuit pointed out is that since the agency was also assuming that all of the oil would be refined, it needs to -- it needs to taut up the environmental consequences at the refinery. In many cases, that will not be the case, but that's -- that's why the reasonable foreseeability standard is met here.\n\nAnd the --\n\nJudge:\nDo -- do -- do you think that the agency could turn down the project on that basis? I mean, I -- I take it you must, because you were assuming that the agency couldn't mitigate the harms by saying you can't carry this particular product. Do you think that the agency can turn down the product? Is that the sort of assumption that's underlying what you're saying?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo I think that is the assumption on which the D.C. Circuit decided the case.\n\nBut that's not a NEPA question obviously. It is a question of the -- the authority under the ICCTA.\n\nJudge:\nI mean, it seems related to a NEPA question because, if the agency can't mitigate the harm and it can't turn down the entire project, one wonders what all this fuss and bother is about.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight.\n\nI think the D.C. Circuit understood that these were the types of -- the types of considerations and certainly the downline impacts, I -- I -- I think probably the upstream impacts as well, were the kinds of considerations that -- I mean, they did motivate at least one member of the Board to dissent from -- to dissent from the decision. So, as the case came to the Court and as the question presented is framed for you, that -- that is not the question.\n\nThat -- that's -- that's taken as a given.\n\nJudge:\nCan --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAnd I take --\n\nJudge:\n-- can I ask about foreseeability? Because, I -- I mean, foreseeability is certainly part of the inquiry, but I'm having -- you're -- you're -- you're seeming to make it the entire thing. And if it were the entire thing, Public Citizen couldn't have come out the way it came out, where it was perfectly foreseeable what environmental effects were going to flow from those trucks. So I guess I'm wondering, it's got to be more than that, right, Mr. Jay?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt is more than that.\n\nSo the government has this mantra in its brief about attenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material. We actually agree with a lot of that, that -- that things that are too attenuated or speculative for the agency to -- to look at, those are excluded by the foreseeability standard. And then setting it even separate and apart from the foreseeability standard, this is almost sort of the -- the flip side of -- of Mr. Clement's position.\n\nMr. Clement seems to be saying that if somebody else has authority to look at it, this agency shouldn't.\n\nSo our -- our position is, if the -- if this agency doesn't have authority to look at it, it is not required to. And then the third point is that they obviously have to be environmental in nature. That was the thrust of Metropolitan Edison, that some things are not environmental consequences at all because they don't bear -- there 's no causal relationship between the -- the agency action and the effect on the physical environment. So I think each of those is -- is part of the analysis, but quite a -- quite a bit of it is accomplished by the reasonable foreseeability standard.\n\nAnd I -- I think that there -- there -- it's important to distinguish between two questions.\n\nOne is how much process should NEPA -- should the agency give the things that are within what NEPA tells it to look at? And much of Mr. Kneedler's presentation focused on that. And we agree a hundred percent that agencies have a lot of discretion to say we're going to prioritize these effects over others. And we think that's the necessary concomitant of the -- of the BUILDER Act and the 150-page limit and the time limit, that agencies are going to have to prioritize some effects over others. They will get deference if they explain briefly what their reasoning is for doing so.\n\nThat could have to do with their statutory mission. It could have to do with their expertise. But what Congress did not do is say that it was going to attack this -- the problem of NEPA being too -- having too broad a compass by saying -- by changing the reasonable foreseeability standard. And that's the problem with what Mr. Clement is proposing, is that he's saying that even where the agency finds something reasonably foreseeable and says, we should study that, and in that study, it makes a basic AP error -- APA error, like the one that the district court -- sorry, that the court of appeals in this case found to be utterly unreasoned. Mr. Clement says: No problem, harmless error, because NEPA didn't require you to study that at all. And that, we think, is the wrong way to -- to attack the problem because the reasonable foreseeability standard is in the statute, and -- and this sort of alternative \"not my problem\" standard is not.\n\nJudge:\nWhy do you say that the agency here didn't do anything? I thought there were 50 pages of their EIS that was dedicated to the environmental consequences of new oil and gas drilling and refining.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo the -- the -- the upstream development, I -- I -- I think it's -- it's a curious case, Justice Jackson, because the -- as you say, the agency took quite a bit of time looking at certain aspects of upstream development.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I'm assuming that you're right that strict scrutiny applies, and now prong number one in that world is do -- does the government have a compelling interest.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nAnd --\n\nJudge\nAnd so I'm trying to understand why the government's argument that we have data manipulation concerns, which I understood you in colloquy with Justice Kavanaugh to say is a risk, and we are concerned, based on what Justice Gorsuch says when he's looking at the facts, you know, that the government contends that there's this real problem with this foreign adversary doing manipulation in other places, are you saying those are not compelling government interests?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI am 100 percent saying that content manipulation is not just not a compelling governmental interest, it is an impermissible governmental interest.\n\nYou could not go to CNN or Fox News and say we're going to regulate you because you're manipulating the content in the way that we don't like.\n\nThat is per se impermissible.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nThat is why --\n\nJudge\nCan I just ask you one last thing? You -- you say with respect to the tailoring issue that disclosure, you think, is a possible more narrowly tailored way of handling some of this.\n\nAnd I guess I'm just wondering whether disclosure under this Court's case law and the law of other lower courts doesn't carry its own First Amendment complications, that don't we have -- wouldn't we have compelled speech problems if disclosure was required in this situation?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSure, Your Honor. Now, look, I might think so because I think that the factual predicate is wrong, but they think the factual predicate is right.\n\nAnd if the factual predicate is right, then there are no First Amendment problems at all under Zauderer and the cases that you're suggesting.\n\nAnd that underscores the larger problem here.\n\nNot all disclosures are perfect. I'm not here to argue that they are.\n\nBut you've always got to consider what the alternative is. And, here, the alternative is shutting down one of the largest speech platforms in America.\n\nThe reason there's no evidence in this record as to disclosures is because Congress never even undertook that balancing in the first place --\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n-- the bare minimum that has to be done before we take an unprecedented -- unprecedented step of shutting down the voices of 170 million Americans.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Wholly apart from the companies' legal interests here, the Act directly restricts the rights, the First Amendment rights, of American creators to participate and speak in what the Court a little less than a decade ago called the modern public square and what you might say today is the most vibrant speech forum in the United States of America.\n\nAnd the Act, therefore, is inescapably subject to strict scrutiny because of the First Amendment implications.\n\nAnd the Act fails that test and, indeed, any level of scrutiny under this Court's case law because the Act and the reasons behind it defy our history and tradition, as well as precedent.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "477", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' argument and this case have shifted somewhat from the cert stage, as Justice Sotomayor's colloquy with my friend brought out, and I'd just like to focus on two of those at the threshold.\n\nOne is about the 88 miles and one is about the outside the agency's jurisdiction point, that the agency itself did not take this outside the 88 miles view.\n\nThe agency reviewed and found foreseeable the downline impacts. We obviously don't think those are within the question presented, but it's striking that Petitioners are taking a -- a view of what the agency should have studied that is considerably narrower than the agency itself. And the second is about the agency's jurisdiction.\n\nThis case came to this Court as a case in which the D.C. Circuit had recognized that the agency had jurisdiction to -- and authority to consider the effects that were being studied. So, as Petitioners' position has shifted, I think it's also lost any grounding in the text of NEPA.\n\nSo I think it would be -- it would be good to -- to step back there. The impacts at issue here are reasonably foreseeable consequences of this $2 billion railway project whose entire rationale is to transport crude oil.\n\nReasonable foreseeability is the test that Congress -- that has been in NEPA since the beginning and that Congress has recently reaffirmed in the BUILDER Act. In that -- in that statute, as in agency practice leading up to it, when an effect is within the scope of reasonable foreseeability and within the agency's authority to consider, Congress doesn't direct agencies to pass the buck to someone else.\n\nIt directs all federal agencies to cooperate on, where possible, a single environmental review so that federal decision-making at -- from the threshold is informed by these environmental considerations. Congress also addressed these policy concerns that Mr. Clement has emphasized quite vigorously by adopting the page limits, the time limits, and also some scope limits that haven't -- haven't come up this morning. We agree with a number of the things that the government said in its brief.\n\nIn particular, points B1 and B3 of its brief, I think you'll find more agreement with what I've said than Mr. Kneedler was able to get to today. There's no reason --\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Would you just spend a -- articulate what you think the close connection is with the Gulf Coast communities?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the reason that the effects -- the refining effects are reasonably foreseeable in this case and I think probably would not be in some others is that the very purpose of this project is not only to bring a specific type of crude oil to the National Rail Network but to transport it for refining, and there are only a few places that have the capacity to do that. I think that's why the agency itself was able to identify the limited number of places where this oil could go.\n\nAnd, again, the whole raison d'etre of this project is to transport one commodity and one commodity only. That -- that won't be the -- that won't be the case in many other railroad projects, but I do think it's a -- it's a little bit misleading for Mr. Clement to suggest this is an 88-mile railroad, as if the train just went back and forth for 88 miles.\n\nIt's a connection to the National Rail Network, whose entire purpose was to bring this crude oil to the market.\n\nJudge: Do you think as a common carrier that this agency could say we don't like oil refining, and, hence, because it creates pollution, I'm not going to build this railroad because the crude oil will lead to oil refining that will pollute the environment?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I think -- so let me just say as a prefatory matter, I think that would be a question about the agency's organic statute and not about NEPA.\n\nI suspect that it probably could not because of the common carrier --\n\nJudge: So, if it --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- mandate.\n\nJudge: -- can't, which is what I assume because the statute doesn't permit it to discriminate in that way -- it says you have to carry all products and person -- cargo and persons -- then why is it within their purview to say or determine what the increase of refining will be and whether it'll be damaging when there's another agency that has the power to control that? It can't -- it has no power to say don't refine the oil.\n\nAnother agency might do that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the -- the purpose of NEPA review of this -- on this point, I'd like to make three points. So one is that the Board is weighing the transportation merits of this project, whether to authorize this project as -- as a substantive matter, against the environmental consequences.\n\nThat's the test that the Board applies under its organic statute.\n\nAnd so, when the Board concludes that a railway project is --\n\nJudge: But it's not the carrying that causes the pollution; it's the refining that causes the pollution, and the railroad can't control that refining because it can't prohibit it.\n\nYou know, it could stop it by not permitting the shipment, but it's not entitled to make those choices. It's a common carrier.\n\nIt has to carry the goods.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think that as a matter of its organic statute, it might well take that approach.\n\nNow, in -- but --\n\nJudge: Isn't that what it did here?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No, I don't think so.\n\nI -- I think that it's closer -- what it did here is closer to something that you said a moment ago, which is to say, essentially, we -- we, this agency, don't regulate the refineries, and, therefore, we need not look at the -- at the consequences. And I think that that's inconsistent with what the agency -- with what NEPA requires because --\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: But why is -- why is --\n\nJudge: Why don't you complete your answer.\n\nJudge: Yeah.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

You have the manufacturers aiding and abetting, in your theory, by producing guns that are singularly attractive to the cartel because they are designed in a particular way that cartel members like, because they're showy.\r\n\r\nThey're making erasable serial numbers, which obviously are attractive to criminals because every criminal would like to erase the serial number if they can.\r\n\r\nSo that's what you claim is aiding and abetting.\r\n\r\nBut what are you claiming interstate the distributor wholesaler did other than selling the product? They don't design it.\r\n\r\nThey didn't do any of the -- they didn't design it.\r\n\r\nThey didn't have anything to do with that. They just have a product they're selling.\r\n\r\nSo how do we make in -- how are your allegations enough with respect to interstate? And if we were to say they're not enough with respect to interstate, doesn't that break the causal connection with the manufacturers?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nJudge, the -- the complaint actually details six or seven different examples of how the manufacturers are actively participating in the illegal market.\r\n\r\nOne --one of them is design.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI --I -- I -- I'm accepting that.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI'm asking, tell me what it says that the distributors are doing.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nWhat it says the distributors are doing, including the -- the one that's named in this complaint, are knowingly supplying the dealers who we know sell unlawfully across the border.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut knowledge is not enough.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly said mere knowledge is not enough.\r\n\r\nYou have to aid and abet in some way.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nWhat the -- what --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYou have to -- you have to intend and take affirmative action to encourage what they're -- not to encourage but to participate in what they're doing.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nWhat this Court said in Rosemond is a person who actively participates in a criminal scheme, knowing its intent and character, intends that scheme's commission. That's the criminal aiding -and -abetting standard.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYeah, that -- that is the standard.\r\n\r\nThat was a question I wanted to circle back with you on. If 922 and 3 and 4 are your predicate violations and -- and aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. Section 2, I think, would then be your aiding -and -abetting hook, that's a criminal -- those are criminal statutes.\r\n\r\nAnd the mens rea under Rosemond is intent, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nThe mens rea under Rosemond for aiding and abetting in the criminal context --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\n--would -- would be intent under Rosemond.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nAnd --and you're invoking criminal statutes.\r\n\r\nSo is -- is that the standard you have to meet here?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nIt's the standard we have to meet, but just as in Rosemond, if you actively participate knowing the scheme --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nSure, then you can infer knowledge.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\n--then you can infer --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI -- I get that.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\n--particularly at the motion -to-dismiss stage.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nGot it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nAnd --and let me --if I could, I want to be pretty specific about some of the allegations in the complaint, because what I heard this morning was that the allegations are vague and -- and so forth. I want to point you to a few particular allegations.\r\n\r\nTwo of them are at paragraphs 122 and 146.\r\n\r\nAnd this has to do with trace data.\r\n\r\nDefendants are alleged to regularly receive -- I'm sorry?\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nOne-twenty-two?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nParagraphs 122 and 146 I'm starting with.\r\n\r\nRegularly receive even more direct information about problem dealers.\r\n\r\nTrace requests from ATF and other agencies alert defendants that guns they sell to specific distributors and dealers are being recovered at crime scenes.\r\n\r\nParagraph 146: Authorities have repeatedly identified and recovered defendants' guns in connection with notorious gun trafficking rings.\r\n\r\nParagraph 232: Defendants are aware that specific networks of distributors and dealers they were supplying were consistently channeling their guns.\r\n\r\nParagraph 233: Century Arms received communications from ATF.\r\n\r\nThose trace requests revealed that specific distributor and dealer networks were disproportionately associated with those guns.\r\n\r\nParagraph 234: All of the other defendants have access to the same information.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly the kind of specific allegation in the complaint at this stage that satisfies a motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut that -- that -- those statements aren't allegations of violations of the law, correct? I mean, those statements just go to whether or not the defendant had knowledge that at the end of the day, some deal -- some dealers might be doing something wrong, these guns that they're selling are ending up in the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nBut I took the statutory language here to be requiring more in terms of a violation on the part of the defendants in this case.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nIt certainly requires, Judge, a knowing violation, but as far as these allegations go, what these allegations show is that the dealers, a small number that is responsible for the large number of guns, are knowingly violating federal laws and that these suppliers, these manufacturers and the distributor, know that is happening and continue to actively supply.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to make --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut what you don't have is particular dealers, right? I mean, it's --it's a --it's a pretty -- there are lots of dealers.\r\n\r\nAnd you're just saying they know that some of them do.\r\n\r\nBut which some of them?

{"id": "792", "dialogue": "Judge: Counsel, just a couple of quotes from cases. In Cedar Point, we said that the Court in First English concluded categorically that the government must pay just compensation for physical invasion. In Knick, it said First English rejects the view that the Constitution does not of its own force furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Now we've -- we've said those in many cases. Those are just two recent ones --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: -- where I wrote the opinions. So -- (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correctly wrote the opinions.\n\nJudge: --so do you have any dispute with those -- those holdings?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We do not, Your Honor. That's a question of the substantive right, which Texas does not dispute, and you could pursue that claim under the Texas cause of action in a Texas court or here --\n\nJudge: But it -- it's --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: --in federal court -- yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: -- it's the statement of the -- the right, and that's a federal right, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So you can require that a federal assertion of rights like that be brought in state court and not in federal court?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, it's brought under a -- a state cause of action. So, I mean, you can remove -- there's diversity jurisdiction or something like that, like any other sort of cause of action, but the cause of action itself is created by -- by Texas. And that's how it's been -- as this Court explained in Knick, that's how state courts have always done it. Since the 1870s, this Court said and onwards --\n\nJudge: Well, it said -- what we said in --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: --that's how we've done it.\n\nJudge: -- what we said in Knick is that the Constitution of its own force furnishes the basis for a court to award money damages. And you think what we had in mind is a -- a basis to -- to -- in state court but not federal court?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: When the claim is against a state, in Knick, the Court said 19 times by our count 1983. Every time the Court states the holding in Knick, they tie it to Section 1983 because there's a difference between the substantive right and the cause of action. In Knick, the cause of action was Section 1983 because Congress said, if you're going to sue municipalities or cities, there you go, there's the cause of action.\n\nJudge: Well, you removed to federal court, where you couldn't bring an action under 1983, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct, Your Honor. We did remove to federal -- federal court. Two reasons for that. One, this is not just one case. These are four separate cases, all putative class actions. They say there's more than a hundred plaintiffs here. Texas -- these are filed in different counties. Texas has no way to put all of them in a single Texas court. So, if the cases were going to be in a single court, it had to be through removal and put them in -- in that court. The second reason for that was Texas courts don't have a lot of experience with implied rights of action under federal law. This is the bread and butter of this Court -- your court resolves factual -- those types of issues all the time. So we thought let's just get it there, we'll get everybody in one case, and we can take out this, you know, putative federal cause of action, which we think is flatly irreconcilable to begin with.\n\nJudge: So under what basis would they proceed against the state under -- under 1983?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They -- they couldn't, Your Honor. There is no such claim. Congress has said that you can bring claims against cities and municipalities. You cannot sue the states under Section 1983. They say they can. So, under Bell v. Hood, they've claimed that there is a federal cause of action. When someone asserts that a federal cause of action exists, the federal courts have jurisdiction to decide whether that is true, and then they can decide on the merits whether the cause of action exists.\n\nJudge: Well, isn't that a -- a Catch-22 or -- I mean, you say they have to proceed in -- in state court. They can't proceed in federal court. And as soon as they do, you remove it to federal court under 1983, where you say they can't proceed?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, we would make the same argument in state or federal court that there is no federal cause of action directly under the Fifth Amendment. That is not --\n\nJudge: Well, but that's what was rejected in -- in the two cases that I read you, Cedar Point and Knick.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: With respect, Your Honor, I don't read either of those cases as saying there is a federal cause of action. There's certainly a federal substantive right to relief, but as this Court said in all of the Bivens line of cases or all the implied right of action cases, the right to, you know, a -- a substantive right does not therefore mean that there is a cause of action.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "262", "dialogue": "Judge\nBut the in rem and -- oh.\n\nJudge\n-- at the end of the day, you're really just asking us to over --to throw out the general rule that sovereigns can't be sued for appropriations of this sort, right? I mean, once you say commingling counts, well, then everything's -- everything's pretty much fair game, except for the rare possibility that's been mentioned that they happen to have an account that's, you know, appropriated funds in a particular instance.\n\nIt seems to me that -- is there -- is there anything wrong with it? In other words, we know that from Sabbatino and the second Hickenlooper amendment that Congress had in mind a much narrower exception than that.\n\nSo, other than curious, bizarre situations of accounting, like the one when they have a separate account for appropriated property, this is really just throwing out the whole sovereign immunity principles under which the rest of the world operates?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nI don't think that's quite right, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nCongress passed the expropriation exception over the Executive's opposition, knowing that that was a departure from international law.\n\nIt did so in response to Sabbatino, but it wasn't -- the language that it passed wasn't limited to the facts of Sabbatino. Congress enacted broad language.\n\nSabbatino itself involved fungible property.\n\nThe Court there recognized traceability problems. Congress knew that but enacted the broad language anyway.\n\nJudge\nWell, but -- sorry to interrupt, but it seems to me you're just agreeing with me that that's what will happen under your theory.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo no.\n\nI also think there are significant guardrails to our theory. One is the guardrail that this Court put up in Philipps in interpreting the expropriation exception requiring that you're only talking about domestic takings.\n\nAnd so -- I'm sorry, the domestic takings rule applies.\n\nAnd so a foreign country can't be sued for takings from its own citizens.\n\nThat's already one limitation.\n\nIn addition to that, though, plaintiffs actually have to be able to -- to -- to show liquidation and commingling.\n\nUsually, when somebody's property is stolen, at that point, they don't know what happened to it. This is the rare case, the Holocaust is the rare case, where there is extensive documentation of what Hungary's practice was.\n\nAnd we put that documentation before the district court.\n\nHungary did not rebut it. That's why the -- the district court relied on three key sources that we put in: the Hungarian Constitutional Court decision from 1993, a manuscript about the Holocaust in Hungary written by one of Hungary's own experts, and archives from the U.S. Holocaust Museum.\n\nAll three of those sources established that Hungary had a practice of not just expropriating but then also liquidating the property, melting it down, commingling it with state funds, including in -- in -- in the -- the country's general -- general accounts.\n\nJudge\nWell, you think in most --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nAnd so this is the rare --\n\nJudge\n-- you think in most cases that the appropriated property is not commingled with the general funds?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nIt would have to be established.\n\nAnd, again, typically, a plaintiff is not going to know that.\n\nThis is a case where -- because the Holocaust is a unique situation, where we actually do have documentation.\n\nA plaintiff can't just go into court and say: My property was taken, I have no idea what happened to it, but I think it was probably commingled, so, therefore, the sovereign -- the sovereign immunity doesn't apply.\n\nJudge\nCounsel --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nThat --\n\nJudge\nThe example you gave, Mr. Dvoretzky, you said, you know, unless a country were stupid enough to establish a Holocaust expropriation fund, but I'm wondering whether, even if a country did establish a Holocaust expropriation fund, whether that would be good enough under the Petitioners' theory, because, you know, there were 500,000 victims of the Hungarian Holocaust.\n\nSo there, a lot of money, you know, from different people going into that fund.\n\nSo that's all commingled.\n\nSo, even in that case, it seems the Petitioner would say the country is off the hook.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo, again, I -- I think that there's no reason to think that -- that Hungary actually had this kind of a Holocaust theft fund.\n\nSo I think that --\n\nJudge\nYes, I know.\n\nIt's -- it's an example to sort of suggest -- I -- I mean, a country's never going to pay, you know, under the expropriation exception, which Congress passed presumably to do something.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nRight.\n\nJudge\nLike, even if a country set up an expropriation fund, all that money is commingled too.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nRight.\n\nIt -- it is -- it's certainly commingled with the country's overall asset -- asset base, sure.\n\nJudge\nEven if it's not.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nCounsel, can I ask you -- because I guess I'm still stuck on whether or not the tracing requirement is inherent in the nature of the nexus that is necessary for jurisdiction here, so let me ask you a hypothetical.\n\nSuppose Hungary obtained expropriated art and then it brought it into, you know, its museum somewhere and then lost track of it, lost it.\n\nWe just can't find it.\n\nIt never sold it. It never exchanged it.\n\nIt just disappeared.\n\nWould there be jurisdiction to sue under this statute in your view?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo I think we have to distinguish under the statute between Hungary and the instrumentality.\n\nFor the instrumentality, the nexus requirement does not require that the property be present in the United States.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nThe instrumentality has to have the property or property exchanged for it, and it has to engage in commercial activity in the United States.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nIn your hypothetical, where we don't know, however, that either the instrumentality or the country still even has the property --\n\nJudge\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\n-- if that can't be established, then I think the expropriation exception probably would not be satisfied in that situation.\n\nJudge\nAnd it's because the property, as far as we know in terms of facts on the ground right now, doesn't exist.\n\nIt's not present.\n\nIt isn't there.\n\nSo that suggests to me that this really is about identifiable property that is presently either in the United States or with the foreign instrumentality that is doing work with the United States, right?\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And that's -- that seems to go beyond what I thought the statute was all about.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nSo that is not our position, Judge.\r\n\r\nWe're not -- we're not saying that -- that -- that NEPA requires the agency to conclude -- to conduct environmental review that wouldn't inform its decision-making. And that -- that's an important aspect of where I began, that the D.C. Circuit concluded, and as the government pointed out in Footnote 7 of its principal brief, nobody sought cert on the question whether these effects are with -- were within the government -- the agency's authority to regulate.\r\n\r\nSo Public Citizen is an excellent -- excellent example of the point that the agency is not required to study what it has no authority to -- to act on, as a --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut Public Citizen is different.\r\n\r\nI mean, it's -- it -- it does -- it has the authority, the Board here has the authority --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- to decide whether or not this 88-mile track is approved, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nAnd the question is, I think, that Judge is asking, to what extent does information about what happens in the refining process inform this Board's determination with respect to exercising that authority? I don't understand why it matters if, as Judge pointed out, they're a common carrier, they have a -- they're not allowed to discriminate as to what gets carried on the tracks.\r\n\r\nSo, if they can't say what gets carried, then what difference does it make that the refinery is putting -- you know, putting out environmental effects to their decision as to whether or not to approve this?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nSo it matters because it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of this railway project because of what these trains will carry and because one of the things that NEPA requires agencies to do is to look at the foreseeable consequences even when they cannot be mitigated. I mean, that's in Section 4332(C)(ii) of the statute.\r\n\r\nAny reasonably foreseeable adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided if the proposal should be implemented. That's part of the study. And so, in other words, for the agency to say, well, we don't have authority to mitigate these effects and, therefore, we won't look at them at all, that is ignoring a category of consequences just like --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nDon't you have to have an argument that their study -- let's say they do study them, and they determine they have great impact.\r\n\r\nDon't we -- doesn't someone have to make the determination that those impacts should really matter with respect to whether or not this project gets approved? I mean, they're so far down the line. They're really -- they depend on a bunch of other people's actions.\r\n\r\nAll the things they say.\r\n\r\nDon't you have to show that there's some pretty close connection or tie between those impacts and this decision?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nSo I want -- I want to distinguish between two points.\r\n\r\nOne is the far-down-the-line point, and I think the foreseeability standard deals with that.\r\n\r\nAnd the second is the thrust of your question, which is, would the agency look at it? And there certainly are cases where agencies either don't take environmental considerations into -- into account or they -- or they don't take certain environmental considerations into account. But the effects in this case -- and we've been talking a lot about refining, but there are obviously multiple categories of effects in this case -- these are the types of effects that the Board, in conducting this broad weighing between transportation merits and environmental consequences, does take into account. I mean, take the downline consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Board has an entire regulation about the environmental consequences of permitting a new railway which will then have trains go onto the National Rail Network and go -- go onto other tracks.\r\n\r\nIt has an environmental -- an entire regulation directing applicants to explain the environmental consequences for other areas, for things like air pollution. Obviously, the Board doesn't regulate air pollution, but it absolutely does take into account the -- the consequences on other rail lines of adding new rail traffic.\r\n\r\nThe downline impacts in this case, which -- which the Board studied but made basic APA errors on --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut you don't appreciate --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\n-- are an example of that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "540", "dialogue": "Judge:\nI'll mention just as an aside some of the amicus briefs go into the fact that it -- it may well be more difficult to travel on the weekends.\n\nBut I guess putting that aside, the second practical reason, the procedural one, is that we're talking about deadlines with severe consequences.\n\nThe question of how and when your deadline runs should be easily understood and easily calculated, especially when there are severe consequences.\n\nAnd on the government's view, you have to undertake a case-by-case determination for each deadline in the regulations and each deadline in the INA.\n\nMaybe I could give an example.\n\nSo there's a 180-day deadline in the regulations, Section 1003.23, a 180-day for seeking relief from in absentia removal.\n\nThat statutory deadline -- that regulatory deadline doesn't cross-reference the statute.\n\nSo you might think, if you pick up the regulation and pick up the definition, you know how it applies.\n\nBut the government --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, but that -- that --in seeking relief, that -- that's requiring you to file some sort of a document.\n\nJudge:\nThat's true, although, as my colloquy with Justice Barrett explained, there are other deadlines in the regulations, like things like getting married and getting fingerprinted.\n\nAnd the point is that on the government's view, even though that regulatory deadline is facially clear, you need to go to the INA and see if there's a statutory analogue for that 180-day deadline, it turns out there is in Section 1229a.\n\nBut even then you're not done.\n\nOn the government's view, now you have to construct a family tree for the statutory deadline and the regulatory deadline and see which one came first.\n\nOnly then can you figure out if your deadline is on a Saturday or Monday.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nRight.\n\nI may understand it.\n\nThis is the argument for a uniform rule.\n\nIt makes things -- it makes things simpler.\n\nSo I --I -- I get that.\n\nI get that.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, and I think --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nCounsel, it's not only that it's simpler, but the INA is filled with provisions like this where the individual's activities are tied to the government's activities, correct?\n\nJudge:\nThat's right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAnd, here, Section 1302, going back to Justice Barrett's question in part, says that when someone's visiting the United States, if they're going to stay longer than 30 days, it says -- the provision states that noncitizens who remain in the U.S. for 30 days or longer must apply for registration and be fingerprinted before the expiration of such 30 days.\n\nSo that's very clear like our 60 days here.\n\nUnder the government's theory, I don't know whether they can be fingerprinted by the government on Saturday or Sunday.\n\nWe'd have to figure that out, correct?\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWe'd have to figure out whether the agency is open for them to register on Saturday and Sunday, correct?\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo these are the practical difficulties. With respect to the issue here, yes, there's an obligation on the alien to depart, but there's also a responsibility tied to the motion to reopen, correct --\n\nJudge:\nThat's exact --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- which is a court activity?\n\nJudge:\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo it's not simply an obligation that's tied only to the individual.\n\nIf the individual does something, then the government has an obligation to -- to dismiss their order of removal and give them additional time, correct?\n\nJudge:\nThat's right.\n\nAnd I think it's telling that the regulations tie this departure deadline to a filing deadline.\n\nIt shows that in the government's view at least before, these things maybe aren't that different at all.\n\nBut the confusion, as your questioning highlights, there are hundreds of instances of the word \"day\" in Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations and dozens, if not a couple hundred, of instances in the INA. And in the government's view that for each of those, not only -- that the statute and regulations require somebody for each of those to undertake this intricate analysis of statutory and legislative history just doesn't make sense, especially -- I mean, it does -- it's hard enough for lawyers to figure out in an individual case an individual deadline under the government's view, is it Saturday or Monday.\n\nThe idea that pro se noncitizens --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nDo you know --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nAre you seriously -- oh, no, go ahead.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nNo, go ahead.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nDo you seriously think that there are people in the position of your client who rely on this and say, well, this is really important for me to get out of the country or withdraw my -- my acquiescence in voluntary departure within 60 days, but, wow, I read this, so I've got another two days? I mean, seriously?\n\nJudge:\nSeriously.\n\nAnd let me make three points.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nJudge:\nSo, first, there are plenty of immigration organizations that provide guidance to noncitizens about how deadlines apply.\n\nSecondly, that accords with --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI mean, if you were providing advice, would you say, okay, you know, you've got the extra two days? Would you?\n\nJudge:\nI mean, if the government's position is adopted in this case, certainly not, but I think, in the absence of that, everything points --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, with how, you know, the way things are --were at the time when --when this came into play, would you say, well, you've got the extra two days?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I think, as we view it—\n\nJudge: More than that. I'm going to need— (Laughter.)\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. I—I—I thought you might.\nI think, as we view it, the Court made a move in Apprendi that I think your colloquy with opposing counsel illustrated.\nThe Court made a move in Apprendi to extend the Sixth Amendment's treatment of things as an element to various features of criminal statutes that the legislature intended as sentencing factors.\nAnd I think we would take the view that viewing that as somewhat of an extension of what the Sixth Amendment literally demands, there wouldn’t be any burden on us to show unanimous or near-unanimous practice.\nSo long as, as we think the history indicates, this was left to the legislature to describe, we think the legislature would retain that room today.\n\nBut, again, the Court doesn’t need to get into any of this today.\nIt is clear from the historical practice that there's really nothing like this.\nAt most, the amicus marshals some decisions that show—beyond simply reaffirming the correctness of Almendarez-Torres—that district courts or trial courts could conduct some sort of sequencing determination, which we think a court can do because it can find the time of the prior offense, but, at the very least, can find the time of the prior conviction.\n\nAnd even those cases are relatively modern.\nThere is only South Carolina, so far as we can tell, under a 1955 statute and a 1972 decision that has allowed for litigation in front of a judge of the type of thing that the different occasions inquiry of ACCA might encompass.\n\nAnd we're talking about, you know, precise timing questions.\nSo a court, we think, on its own could determine that on or—the jury necessarily found that an event occurred on or about April 7th, for example.\n\nBut the kind of timing questions that are involved under the ACCA's different occasions inquiry are going to be more fine-grained than that.\nYou could have acts occurring across a single day that are separate occasions.\nSells drugs in the morning.\nIn the afternoon, robs a store.\nIn the evening, comes home and beats his spouse.\nLike, those would be three separate occasions.\nThere's clearly a chance to have a break in between those.\n\nJudge: What about this one across—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: This one, we think, is crystal clear.\nWe think it should clearly be found harmless on remand.\n\nJudge: Not—we shouldn’t do it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Oh, Your Honor, we're fine with you simply affirming on harmlessness grounds if that's what the Court chooses to do.\nThe Court's usual practice is to remand these things.\nWe think we've got a crystal-clear case on remand, and we will in most of these cases.\nIt'll be a vanishingly small number where we don't, but here, you have separate robberies that occurred on April 4th, April 8th, and April 11th—\n\nJudge: And would there be some value—I mean, I guess, a value if you think—I’m not saying I agree with you—but if—if we agreed with you that this was a crystal-clear case, would there be some value to lower courts in saying, like, this is the kind of thing that, you know, under Wooden would still be different occasions?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure.\nI mean, we think that's already clear to some degree from Wooden, which I take to generally say that if you've got offenses spaced as far apart as these are, that it's almost invariably going to be the case that they are on separate occasions.\n\nBut, if the Court wishes to explain that, that—that would be great for us.\nIn particular—or great by us.\nFor us as well. (Laughter.)\n\nIn particular, just to address the harmless error argument that opposing counsel posited a few minutes ago, we don't think simply \"I was in debt\" is enough to make things the same occasion.\n\nThe kinds of circumstances where possibly a jury could—you know, we—we think, you know, it would be fair to find—obviously, this always goes to the jury, but we think would really be realistically found to be the same occasion if they occur across the course of several days—\nmight be what the Court posited in Wooden itself, like they’re part of a common criminal scheme.\n\nSo, for example, you burglarize a store to steal what you need to commit a kidnapping.\nYou commit an assault during the course of the kidnapping, and later you murder the victim.\nIt's possible that, you know, a jury could find that those were all the same occasions—\n\nJudge: Mr.—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —even if it occurred over the course of a few days.\n\nJudge: So, Counsel, on that, first of all, I commend the government for acknowledging the error below in this case. That's an admirable step of candor.\n\nBut, on this harmless error question, let me ask you first, how is a court supposed to conduct that when there hasn’t been a trial and in a world in which almost everybody pleads guilty these days? A really novel development during the course of our lifetimes.\n\nSo, here, the defendant was told that the three predicate ACCA crimes were different than these three crimes that you’re now asking us to—for a court to say are clearly separate occasions and—and, therefore, harmless error.\n\nHow is it harmless when he didn’t know what the charges would be against him when he pled guilty?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I think he—\n\nJudge: Wouldn’t that have informed his bargain?\nPerhaps he would have chosen not to plead guilty if you were going to drag back up convictions from when he was 18 that have nothing to do with his possession of a firearm today as a 40-something-year-old man.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, first of all, I don’t think he was under any assurances that he would not receive an ACCA sentence.\nIn fact, he was—\n\nJudge: No, but in the information, the government specifically listed three other predicate offenses, not these.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "541", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I ask you about Saxon itself and also comments in your brief that it would make no sense to adopt the opposing side's view? Because, in Saxon, at oral argument, it was repeatedly stated to us: If we're talking about a company that is shipping its own goods, those people likely wouldn’t have been railroad employees or seamen at the time.\n\n\"Not just Amazon department stores, those people are likely not exempt, and here’s why.\n\nThere was a distinction that was made between railroads that shipped things for the public, and I think that’s how we normally understand seamen and railroad employees, and say, a coal company’s internal railroads.\n\nAnd there’s more.\n\nWe have seamen and railroad employees—the two classes of workers that had preexisting dispute resolution statutes at the time and were commonly understood categories.\n\nAs a class, the seamen are the people who do the work of the shipping industry.\n\nAs a class, railroad employees are people who do the work of the railroad industry.\n\nNow, I bring that up not to bind anyone. I bring that up just because that was the common-sense understanding of counsel in Saxon, and so it seems odd that you would read the Saxon opinion to have blown through those limits that were being stressed by counsel for Saxon about the implications of the position, number one.\n\nAnd it seems odd also to say the other side’s position just makes no sense when—given what was said at the oral argument in Saxon.\n\nSo I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. A few responses to that. One is, you know, we don’t read Saxon to decide the question presented here.\n\nI don’t think—\n\nJudge: I certainly didn’t think that based on what happened at oral argument.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. And I think it leaves the question presented open, although I will say I think the opposing argument is inconsistent with the reasoning of Saxon, which is: We look at what these words meant in 1925, and we also are looking for a commonality between seamen and railroad employees. And if there isn’t that commonality, we’re not going to add an additional requirement.\n\nNow, I think you asked about some answers to the hypotheticals in Saxon.\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: You know, and I’ll note that this question wasn’t presented either way in Saxon, and there were some hypotheticals that I do think touched on this question, but the— you know, and I apologize if the answer wasn’t as clear as it should have been.\n\nThe gravamen of that—\n\nJudge: Well, I thought the answer was very clear, actually.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, so—so—\n\nJudge: It was reassuring. I think the word “narrow” was used—reassuring that the holding in favor of Saxon would be narrow and would not extend to industries other than the transportation industry.\n\nWhich—that may be incorrect, but to call it like that makes no sense is a little much for me, at least.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure. And I think the gravamen— you know, there were specific predictions maybe, but the gravamen of that answer is: To know whether the Federal Arbitration Act exempts a particular class of workers, what we’d have to do is go back and look in 1925 and see what these words meant.\n\nAnd we’ve now— you know, because it wasn’t the question presented in Saxon, that research hadn’t been done.\n\nWe’ve now done that.\n\nAnd I think it’s very clear that in 1925, the word “seamen” did not mean somebody who was employed by a company that sold transportation.\n\nAnd I’d like to turn to that briefly, if I may.\n\nYou know, every source we have— when you go back and take a look— dictionaries, case law, books, other statutes— literally any piece of evidence we have confirms that the word “seamen” included anyone who worked aboard a vessel in furtherance of its purpose.\n\nIt had nothing to do with whether an employer sold transportation or, in the Second Circuit’s words, had a particular price or revenue structure.\n\nAnd I’ll note that this Court has already canvassed this history at least twice— first in Wilander and then again in Saxon— and both times it came to the same conclusion, which is that “seamen” is a longstanding, well-defined term that in 1925 plainly meant everybody who worked aboard a vessel.\n\nNow, to its credit, I actually don’t take the opposing side to dispute this ordinary meaning of “seamen.”\n\nMaybe they’ll get up and tell me I’m wrong about how I read their brief, but what I take them to say is: Whatever the ordinary meaning is, for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act, the Court should give the word a different definition.\n\nAnd that different definition should be something like “workers aboard a ship in a carrying trade carrying goods for trade and commerce.”\n\nAnd there are two problems with this request.\n\nThe first is: Not only is this not the ordinary meaning of “seamen” in 1925, it’s not any meaning ever of “seamen” in 1925 or since then.\n\nWhat that definition comes from is a definition that a single district court gave to the term “merchant vessel,” and the term “merchant vessel” is nowhere in the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\nSo the opposing side has to demonstrate a commonality between seamen and railroad employees— not between railroad employees and merchant vessels.\n\nSo that’s the first problem: It’s just not in the statute.\n\nThe second problem, though, is that even if this Court were willing to accept this definition of words that aren’t even in the statute as the definition of “seamen” for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act and define it in accordance with what the opposing side says we should define it, their drivers meet their own definition.\n\nThere’s no question that their truck drivers are engaged in transporting goods for commerce— just like the people on lumber boats in 1925, just like the people on the barges carrying railroad tie manufacturers’ goods in this Court’s decision in Ayer.\n\nAnd so, even if we were to accept every single one of their arguments on seamen, they still haven’t shown that this employer-based industry requirement has anything to do with the words of the statute.\n\nJudge: And just to understand, what are the categories of seamen who do not work in the shipping industry?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: There’s a vast number of them. And they’re not— you know, one thing that’s difficult is they’re not—well, so I actually—I want to take a step back and talk about the word “industry” very briefly.\n\nWhich is to say, when you say “in the shipping industry,” we can mean two different things.\n\nOne is we can mean the workers who are in the industry— as in, these are people who do shipping work. They do the work of the boat.\n\nOr you can mean sort of an employer-based requirement, which is they work for a company that sells transportation—on the opposing side’s version.\n\nAnd I think the intuition that seamen and railroad employees are definitely in the transportation industry is an intuition on the first question about industry people—\n\nJudge: So assuming what I meant was the second.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: So who are the seamen who are not working for shippers?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: There’s a bunch of them. So there are a bunch of manufacturers, for example, who employed seamen.\n\nThere is a railroad tie manufacturer, for example, in Ayer, that employed seamen.\n\nThere were lumber boats all up and down the West Coast that employed seamen. They worked for lumber companies.\n\nThey didn’t work for transportation companies.\n\nThere were coal companies that employed seamen.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company employed seamen.\n\nThere’s a host of employers that employed seamen.\n\nAnd the reason is very similar to why you have a host of companies employing truckers today—\n\nWhich is that, unlike railroads, which require infrastructure, all you needed to ship your own goods is a boat—\n\nJudge: And before—\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: —just like—\n\nJudge: Keep going.

Circuit, declaratory rulings, it's enough to send a comment.\n\nSo their distinction doesn't work on its own terms.\n\nAnd I would point the Court there to Petition Appendix 18a.\n\nThat is where the Fifth Circuit discusses the D.C. Circuit precedent on that point.\n\nBut, second, this is a very strange type of adjudication.\n\nBy statute, Congress has said that if they're going to do this type of license, they need to open up to NEPA, which is a -- a notice-and-comment process, in the middle of the adjudication.\n\nThis is not a normal adjudication.\n\nJudge:\nDo you think it's enough for anybody to send in a letter, or does it have to be the governor of a state?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think it certainly helps that it was a governor of a state.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I don't see really how it does help under the statute.\n\nI mean, it's nice that he was the governor of the state, but I don't see how you can make a legal argument on that basis.\n\nIf somebody is a party by virtue of sending in a letter under this statutory scheme, anybody is a party by virtue of sending in a letter.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo, again, we think that if you file a comment -- and it wasn't just a letter; it's comments -- as part of the notice-and-comment process, but if they solicit you, which is what happened here -- I'd point the Court to the record on this one.\n\nThis was JA 292.\n\nThey asked us, they solicited our comments, and then we responded to that.\n\nEven under their -- their best case, this Water Transport case from the D.C. Circuit that they rely on, if the agency solicits your participation and you respond to that, that counts in the D.C. Circuit, their case.

And it seems to me \"party\" means somebody who has participated in an agency proceeding with the degree of formality required for that proceeding.\n\nSo, if you're in a rulemaking, being a party may very well mean I submitted a comment in a notice-and-comment process.\n\nBut -- but that's not the degree of formality that's associated with a proceeding of this kind.\n\nAnd, you know, you didn't intervene. You didn't even try to intervene, unlike Mr. Frederick's client.\n\nI -- I don't see how we can say that you were a party.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I mean, the word \"party,\" it's the same word in the Hobbs Act that applies to all of these things.\n\nSo we have to say that the word \"party\" is a chameleon.\n\nJudge:\nIt's not a chameleon. It's like different proceedings might understand who parties are differently.\n\nI mean, that's -- that's -- that's not anything weird.\n\nThere are three separate processes, and the way you participate in those three separate processes are -- are different because different rules apply, because the processes are understood to -- parties in -- in adjudications are different from parties in rulemakings.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nOkay.\n\nSo I guess a couple of responses.\n\nOne, I don't agree under the Hobbs Act that you're going to distinguish -- it's --it's one word that has to apply to both.\n\nBut say I'm wrong about that.\n\nJudge:\nIt -- it -- it is one word.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nIt means have you participated with the degree of formality that's necessary for the kind of proceeding it is? And if you are, you're a party.\n\nIt's one definition.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nOkay.\n\nSo say I'm wrong about this.\n\nSo I'm agreeing with you for -- for purposes of this answer.\n\nI would still say what we're talking about here is a lot closer to a hybrid between a rulemaking and an adjudication than a pure adjudication.\n\nThis is a licensing which Congress said by statute they have to take our comments.\n\nAnd then we filed those comments in response.\n\nAnd the argument that we are making today was presented to the agency by Sierra Club, and the agency said no, we're not going to even consider that.\n\nWe're not going to take that contention.\n\nSo we're in the position here where they've asked for our comments, we've responded to their comments.\n\nThe arguments we want to make they've already said they're not going to hear.\n\nIt seems very strange to say that the State of Texas is not a party.\n\nWe're obviously aggrieved.\n\nAnd, by their own regulations, they asked for our participation and we participated.\n\nJudge:\nAre you defending the Fifth Circuit's ultra vires holding? You're saying, even if you weren't a party aggrieved, we could hear your appeal under the theory of ultra vires?

And then just to build on that, do you assume the perspective of someone who would buy one of the shares, or just someone like you could even pretend that you had a third brother named Ralph who only had one share?\n\nLike, what's the right way to think about it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It is a hypothetical buyer of the same proportion of shares in the company.\n\nSo it's a hypothetical buyer of 77.18 percent of the company’s shares.\n\nNow, I think the reason why we talk about the value of a company here is that under the relevant regulations, we are really focusing on the net worth of the company and then multiplying the relevant percentage.\n\nI think both sides are in agreement that this is the correct approach here.\n\nNow, that will not always be true. There may be circumstances in which, for instance, that block of shares gives you a control premium that needs to be valued.\n\nAnd when you look at the lower court case law in this area, often the price will then be adjusted up or down.\n\nBut we're all in agreement that there is no such adjustment here.\n\nAnd so, really, the fundamental question here is: What was the net worth of the company?\n\nAnd to make just two additional points about that, the first is the reason why we're talking about a hypothetical block of 77.18 percent of the shares is precisely because, if we were talking about the actual shares of the deceased, those shares are about to be extinguished.\n\nThey're subject to the redemption obligation.\n\nSo I think there's really no good conceptual way to do that.\n\nAnd I think the regulations recognize that when they talk about the fact that you can look to an equivalent asset, a comparable item, when you're making this determination.\n\nAnd then I think the second thing that I think is important to keep in mind here is, when you're talking about the net worth of the company, I don't really hear the other side disputing the fact that an obligation to redeem shares would be treated ordinarily as a liability like any other.\n\nIt's a legally binding obligation. The accounting standards treat it as a liability.\n\nIn fact, the accounting standards go so far as to specifically enumerate stock to be redeemed upon the death of the holder as giving rise to a liability.\n\nJudge: So fair enough on that, but let's just see if I've got this right, and tell me where I'm wrong.\n\nYou agree that the relevant value is of the corporation as a whole.\n\nAnd, really, the question is: What do we do with the $3 million in life insurance proceeds?\n\nHow should that be dealt with?\n\nAnd I hear the other side saying a prospective buyer would consider that part of the assets of the corporation, and, therefore, it enhances the value of the company.\n\nAnd I hear you saying no, you really shouldn't count those insurance proceeds because they're earmarked for the redemption, and so no willing purchaser would account for them in part of their assessment of the value of the company.\n\nIs that a fair assessment of the difference between the two?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would word the point slightly differently, but I think this difference is important.\n\nWe're not disputing that the life insurance proceeds are an asset.\n\nWhat we're really debating here is whether or not they are a net asset.\n\nJudge: Whether a willing buyer would consider them part of the value of the company that they’re going to obtain when they're really earmarked for redemption?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And what a willing buyer would do, I think, is to look at this and say:\n\nYes, there are $3 million in life insurance proceeds that are going to come into the company, but those proceeds are going to immediately go out again.\n\nThey're going to go out in order to fund this offsetting liability, which is already on the books.\n\nAnd under our approach, which, again, I think accords with a healthy dose of common sense here, when the parties entered into the initial buy-sell agreement, that had the effect of putting an asset and a liability on the books at the same time.\n\nJudge: They offset one another.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They offset each other at every point.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "689", "dialogue": "Judge: All right. Let's say there was a regulation that said that only men can be admitted to one of the military academies, and after the statute of limitations has run, a woman applies, wants to be admitted to a military academy, and you would say it's too late for her to bring a facial challenge to that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We would say that if she applies to the military academy and is denied admission, that at that point there is an application of the regulation to her and that she can raise substantive challenges to the regulation in that context.\n\nJudge: What's the difference between that and the situation of Corner Post, other than the fact that they are indirectly hurt rather than being directly hurt?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I mean, I think the difference is that in that case, there is a subsequent final agency action that provides the focus and that is within the last six years, whereas, on their theory, there's no final agency action that they're pointing to.\n\nJudge: In Justice Jackson's questions, I would have thought it starts running the day they open the business.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Justice, I don't think—\n\nJudge: Just compared to usual APA suits, which start the day the rule is adopted and you're an ongoing business.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that if they wanted to challenge suit before they opened business—the doors for business, what they'd say is, we have concrete plans to accept debit cards.\n\nJudge: Okay. So they—yeah, I take that point.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I mean, I think, like, I'm not saying it's impossible to figure it out.\n\nJudge: Maybe a little bit before. Maybe a little bit before, but you'd have to make a showing there, I think, to get in the door in that context, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I—I think more problematically, it's not they who would have to make that showing. Ordinarily, in an APA case, they would come forward and say we have concrete plans to accept debit cards as of today, and so we can bring the challenge. That's easy. The problem here is that we would have to come in and say they formed concrete plans to accept debit cards sometime before they opened their doors, but how do we know when that was? Again, I'm not saying that's impossible—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —but I'm saying—\n\nJudge: I mean, that's a pretty in-the-weeds debate, but—and I don't think that arises—that would arise that often, but maybe I'm wrong about that. Let me ask a question about the Article III standing point that was raised, just to make sure we're on the same page on that.\n\nMy understanding is the day a rule is adopted and you're a regulated party, even if nothing has happened to you by the agency, you have standing to go in to sue. That happens all the time, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's my understanding too, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And if you're not a regulated party but you're an affected party, which is a big swath at law, you also, if you can show you're an affected party in some way, have standing to sue in injury on the day the rule is promulgated?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I agree with that too.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: What—what do you—how do those—your answers apply if it's a corporation that wasn't incorporated until seven years, you know, rather than six years? But you'd still say they have standing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. We—we don't dispute that they have standing. We just think that their claim is untimely. I do, if—if I could, want to come to the final sentence—\n\nJudge: Can I just follow up on the Chief's question? What if they were thinking about incorporating, but they haven't yet incorporated and they're still within the six-year period and part of whether they incorporate and go into business depends on the structure of the industry and whether this rule is going to help? No standing, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right. I mean, there—there's no case law I can point you to on this because no court in the country has applied their rule. I mean, I think adopting their rule would open the Court up to all sorts of really thorny questions, however far down in the weeds they might be. I think those questions just haven't been explored.\n\nJudge: Those questions—I mean, those questions come up in other contexts. Where is the business really operating? Is it a phony challenge to an—I mean, I've seen that before. So, I mean, maybe.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lawyer, would this rule have effects—Justice in his hypothetical started to ask you about a statute and then switched and was focused on rule.\n\nSo 2401 is the all-purpose statute of limitations. I'm just wondering, is your argument that we should interpret \"accrue\" this way because, in the administrative law context and because of the Hobbs Act and all these specialized statutes, a statute of repose-style accrual is—makes more sense? Would there be spillover effects in, say, you know, hey, I'm sure Congress would prefer all challenges to a statute to be adjudicated right away. Would there be spillover effects?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think there would be spillover effects. You're right that a primary part of our argument, the primary part of our argument is the Hobbs Act and the other special statutory review provisions establishing the standard rule in this context. And so it—it applies sort of here as well.\n\nWe also have an argument about the final sentence of Section 702 that we haven't discussed. But the—the last reason that I don't think it would spill over to statutes is the challenges to statutes are—are necessarily—may I finish the sentence?\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —are necessarily constitutional. And so the Court has allowed claims against the validity of statutes outside of the context of a final agency action requirement as in the APA.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "47", "dialogue": "Judge: I wanted to follow up actually on the previous question. That's where I was headed earlier too. We have an American citizen here who was for years, I don't remember exactly how long, forced to live abroad and fearful about coming home because he didn't know what he was being accused of. Now, the government may very well have had good reasons. I don't for a second mean to suggest otherwise. But an American citizen normally has a right to what's been called every man's evidence against him. That's due process. That's a pillar of our democracy. And here, the government says, no, you don't get that evidence.\n\nJudge: But an alternative was suggested, which is at least share it with the judge. At least share the facts with the judge and maybe with cleared counsel. And you can do it in a SCIF. There are a lot of them. I imagine you spent a fair amount of time in a SCIF preparing for this case. And the government does that all the time under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, under CEPA. Why is it too much to expect that the federal government do at least that when his fundamental liberty, the right to travel, is at stake?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, a couple of responses. First, I do need to push back on the narrative that he was somehow stranded overseas or forced to live overseas. Even someone on the No Fly List can get—\n\nJudge: That's what he alleges.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I understand. But—\n\nJudge: And we have to take that as true at this stage.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But I just want to make it clear for the Court that the reason he came back in 2015 is because, even though he was on the No Fly List, he had a one-time waiver. These are available to any American citizen who's overseas on the No Fly List. That's exactly how he came back. I presume the reason he didn't seek one for the years—the four years he was in Sweden—is because he had a pending Swedish asylum application. I don't know how Swedish law works, but I would imagine if he voluntarily returned, that might affect it. So I just want to resist the premise that he was stranded overseas.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: He could have come back with the one-time waiver, which, when he requested it, allowed him to return. The second piece of your question—I think the judge in this case, the district court, sensibly realized that he's not on the list and he's been assured he won't be put back on the list based on the currently available—\n\nJudge: I'm not asking about the district court judge. I'm asking about the position of the executive branch. And, again, whether he might have had a one-time waiver but was thereafter barred from travel is immaterial. It's his right to travel, his right to every man's evidence.\n\nJudge: And when those two things are at stake, is it too much to ask the federal government to share with the district court in a SCIF enough information to be able to assess the mootness question? Perhaps even share it with cleared counsel, as it does in so many other circumstances under other statutory regimes? Why is that too much to ask the executive branch?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That is exactly what we do when these cases get to the merits. If he had remained on the No Fly List, that's what would have happened. That's what happens in the other cases. There's no question. My only point is, in the mootness context, there has been no district court that has attempted to invoke those kinds of procedures.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We haven't faced that. And the reason, I think, is that mootness, the Article III inquiry, is different from the merits inquiry. For Article III, you're trying to make a predictive judgment about expectation, and when the standard is a threat of engaging in terrorism, I think district courts have sensibly realized that that is just not reasonably expected to occur.\n\nJudge: So, if I can summarize, I think your argument is that it's not necessary here, even though it often is in the merits?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "48", "dialogue": "Judge: Yes.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And I think the important thing to recognize is that the Act here is targeting covert content manipulation by a foreign adversary nation.\n\nNow I understand my friends to say --\n\nJudge: What difference does that make?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The difference is that there is no protected First Amendment right for a foreign adversary to exploit its control over a speech platform.\n\nJudge: No, I mean the difference -- the difference between covert and non-covert.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I think that -- that Congress's concern with a covert operation was that a foreign adversary could effectively weaponize this platform behind the scenes in order to achieve any number of geopolitical goals.\n\nHere -- here are some of the examples that come to mind.\n\nOne of the pages out of the playbook here is for a foreign adversary to simply try to get Americans arguing with one another to create chaos and distraction in order to weaken the United States as a general matter and distract from any activities that the foreign adversary --\n\nJudge: I guess, what --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- might want to conduct on the world stage.\n\nJudge: -- what do you mean by \"covert,\" though? I mean, does \"covert\" just mean it's hard to figure out how the algorithm works? Because we could say that about every algorithm.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No.\n\nThe covert nature of it comes from the fact that it's not apparent that the PRC is the one behind the scenes pulling the strings here and deciding exactly what content is going to be made to appear on the site.\n\nAnd another way that the PRC --\n\nJudge: It's just because we don't know that China's behind it? That's what \"covert\" means?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I think --\n\nJudge: It doesn't have anything to do with the difficulty of figuring out what the algorithm is doing? It's just because people don't know that China is pulling the strings? That's what \"covert\" means?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: What it means is that Americans are on this platform thinking that they are speaking to one another, and this recommendation engine that is apparently so valuable is organically directing their speech to each other.\n\nAnd what is covert is that the PRC, a foreign adversary nation, is instead exploiting a vulnerability in the system to suppress and silence views --\n\nJudge: Well, that's all it means, that, like, people don't know that China's behind it? Like, everybody now knows that China is behind it.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No, but it -- but it's the specific -- the specific content that's being manipulated would be unapparent.\n\nAnd so I think that --\n\nJudge: Well, that's true of every search engine.\n\nI mean, you can --you can take any of these algorithms, whether it's X or whether it's, you know, you name it -- what are the new ones, Bluesky -- I mean, none of these -- none of these are apparent, right? You -- you get what you get and you think that's puzzling.\n\nAnd -- (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: -- and it's all a little bit of a black box.\n\nSo you can't just mean it's a black box, it's covert.\n\nThey're all black boxes.\n\nAnd if you just mean what's covert is the fact that there's China behind it, I mean, honestly, really, like, everybody does know now that there's China behind it.\n\nSo I just don't get what this \"covert\" word does for you.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think the problem with just saying, as a general matter, China has this capability and might at some point be able to exercise it and manipulate the platform is it doesn't put anyone on notice of when that influence operation is actually happening, and, therefore, it doesn't guard against the national security harm from the operation itself.\n\nJudge: General, isn't that a pretty paternalistic point of view? I mean, don't we normally assume that the best remedy for problematic speech is counter-speech? And, you know, TikTok says it could even live with a -- a disclaimer on its website saying this can be covertly manipulated by China in case anybody were left in doubt after today about that possibility.\n\nSo you're saying that won't work because?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That won't work because it is such a generic generalized disclosure that it wouldn't put anyone reasonably on notice about when it's actually happening.\n\nAnd the example I've --\n\nJudge: That's your best --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- been thinking about is --\n\nJudge: -- that's your best argument, is that the average American won't be able to figure out that the cat feed -- feed he's getting on TikTok could be manipulated even though there's a disclosure saying it could be manipulated?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But imagine if you walked into a store and it had a sign that said one of one million products in this store causes cancer.\n\nThat is not going to put you on notice about what product is actually jeopardizing your health.\n\nAnd I think that's roughly equivalent to the type of disclosure they're contemplating here.\n\nThey brought up the example of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA.\n\nJudge: If that -- if that's true --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There, you have to disclose the actual content.\n\nJudge: -- if that's true, then wouldn't that be true for all social media companies for all content? I mean, every editor, every newspaper in its editorial room makes decisions about what it's going to run and how it's going to say it.\n\nAnd every algorithm has preferences, whether it's domestic or foreign.\n\nAnd nobody really knows exactly when those editorial decisions are being made or how, but they're generally aware, and we think that that's enough.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think, though, that there is a real risk that when a foreign adversary has control of that kind of mechanism and a speech platform in the United States, it could weaponize -- weaponize that platform to harm United States interests.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "33", "dialogue": "Judge: And our position is simply that the expert is giving a probabilistic opinion as to whether or not she had -- she knew she had drugs.\n\nJudge: But couldn't you characterize it as the expert is speaking to the class of people who have drugs in their car and know about it?\n\nJudge: Well, I think this brings --\n\nJudge: And they say -- and -- and -- and if you characterize the class as that, then the question is still whether the defendant is in that class, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think, you know, that's one way to put it, but I think, Judge, imagine the expert testified, I think there's an 80 percent chance or I think probably this particular defendant knew she had drugs in the car. That would still leave the same amount of inferential analysis if you want to put it that way to be done by the jury, but it's not inference as to mens rea. It's just inference as to whether or not the defendant is guilty or not. It's still a probabilistic opinion.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the only thing I want to persuade you of is that just like an expert giving a probabilistic opinion about the defendant herself leaves, if you want to put it this way, some room for the jury to confirm that that expert is correct that this defendant is one of the majority, the same thing would be true if the expert said the thing about the defendant herself.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And -- and convert -- and --and the other version of this, I think, that helps prove my point is that, I think, again, and I'll let my -- my friend speak for himself, but I think I understand the government to say that if the defendant says -- if the expert says people like this always know they have drugs in the car, that's covered by Rule 704(b).\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Now that's contrary to Circuit precedent and it doesn't explicitly mention the defendant, but it is covered. And so, if you put together the notion that you don't have to explicitly mention the defendant to cover the defendant with the notion that probabilistic opinions are covered just as much as absolute --\n\nJudge: Well, I don't know --\n\nJudge: Mr. [Defendant's Lawyer] --\n\nJudge: -- how that --I -- I don't know how that testimony, every single person who drives a car across the border with a large quantity of drugs knows that there are drugs in there, how that gets in under 702. They -- an expert's testimony is admissible under 702 if it is the product of reliable principles and methods.\n\nJudge: I don't know what reliable principles and methods could lead anybody to conclude that every single person who does that knows what's in the car.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I --\n\nJudge: So there are other rules that take care of the extreme cases.\n\nJudge: You have -- the expert has to satisfy 702 and then there's always 403 if some -- if in some case the trial judge thinks this is -- this goes too far. I don't know why you have to try to make an exception in 704.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So let me go through both the rules you mentioned, Judge. Under Rule 702, I think the reason why that evidence typically comes in is the expert couches it as in my experience.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And to go back to your hypothetical, in my experience, 83 out of 83, therefore, people always know.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And we cite cases in our brief where the expert has given this exact kind of testimony up to 2013 in the Circuit, so --\n\nJudge: Well, I mean, the - - the fact testimony, 83 out of 83, is one thing.\n\nJudge: Whether it's permissible to draw from that experience the inference that they always know, I think that's dubious under 702.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think you're -- I think you may be right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The brief talks about some of the problems with law enforcement expert testimony that exists sort of writ large across the courts, and maybe Rule -- maybe you have a Rule 702 case that you might want to look at sometime when it comes to that problem, but I don't think you need to do that here because Rule 704(b) is the finer-grained rule that deals particularly with mens rea.\n\nJudge: Mr. [Defendant's Lawyer] --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And -- yeah?\n\nJudge: -- 704 is --is party agnostic, and so what's going to be good for the goose here is going to be good for the gander.\n\nJudge: And I would think that would mean that if -- if we're going to allow this testimony that defendants are going to be able to hire former agents to come in and say: Well, there's an 80 percent chance that drug mules don't know.\n\nJudge: Is that the world we're going to invite if -- if -- if we find for the government here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, it would certainly be allowed. And whether defendants can find those experts is maybe a different question.

{"id": "885", "dialogue": "Judge: In Employees, are we bound as a part of the holding by the methodology applied in the case? Because it seems to me like that's what you're arguing—that this is the methodology that the case employed, and so we must follow the same methodology. Is that part of the holding?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that is part of the holding. I mean, the other thing I would say here is that when you're talking about implications, the cause of action doesn't expressly say anything about sovereign immunity. So you can only find a waiver by thinking that in adopting that cause of action, Congress must also have intended to create a waiver.\n\nJudge: So Employees is part of the backdrop against which Congress legislated in its methodology?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it makes it plausible to think that members of Congress would not have understood just the bare creation of a broad cause of action as sufficient to take the analytically distinct step of waiving sovereign immunity.\n\nJudge: Okay. Second question. Q is your best argument. If it wasn't in the statute, would you lose?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No. If it wasn't in the statute, we would still have exactly the same argument under Employees, and things like the fact that 1681n and O would be unconstitutional as applied to the states, I think, would still give us a --\n\nJudge: Well, unless the states waive their sovereign immunity.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. I mean, of course, you could say the same thing about application to federal agencies, that there are some federal agencies as to which Congress has waived all immunity.\n\nJudge: Last question. Where are you getting the definition that you gave when asked what \"person\" would mean there? Is that just kind of what ordinary people would understand? Is that the Dictionary Act?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It's both. I mean, I think the Dictionary Act definition comports with how an informed legal reader would understand the word \"person\" in most places, and we think that that understanding makes sense in 1681q, so we think it makes sense that Congress could have plausibly used it in the same sense nearby in n and o.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Next question—so I perceive Employees as being structurally dissimilar in relevant ways in light of its amendment history, and so I'm hoping that you can comment on that.\n\nIt seems to me that what happened in Employees, to the extent that there was some uncertainty about what Congress did, was because Congress amended the definitions section, right, to include governments. And that definitions section applied to a whole host of things in the statute—duties, liabilities, and so on—so there was palpable uncertainty on the Court's part as to whether expanding \"employers\" to include government actually affected a waiver of liability with respect to the liability section.\n\nIt seems to me here, when we have the amendment to the liability section expanding, as you conceded previously, the liability section to include other entities by use of the term \"person\" that had been previously defined to include government, we're actually accomplishing a different result.\n\nIt seems to me there isn't the same kind of uncertainty in the relevant situation of whether or not they intended to expand liability, which is what we need for the purpose of a waiver. Can you comment on that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure. Two things in response. First, I think this Court has ordinarily said you just look at the statute as it exists.\n\nJudge: But that's not what happened in Employees. So, if we're going to go with Employees, which is what you're saying, we're following that methodology. They didn’t just do a plain text reading. They were talking about what Congress’s intent was. Isn’t it strange that Congress amended it and didn’t amend the liability provision? And what I’m saying is, here, they did.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If you want to look at that timing, I think the timing actually cuts the other way. In Employees, what Congress was doing was taking a statute that already authorized civil liability against employers and saying, \"We want state agencies to be employers for purposes of this statute. We're going to cover them under the same definition that until now has covered all employers.\"\n\nIn that circumstance, it might have been reasonable to think that Congress intended state agencies to be covered in exactly the same way as all other employers because Congress was specifically focused on state agencies. And yet --\n\nJudge: Yes, but it wasn’t focused on liability for this purpose. That’s my only point. Can I ask you another question?\n\nI hear you suggesting that there has to be an express mention of the federal government in the provision. So I’m wondering, is the government not conceding that we have said you can satisfy the clear statement rule by implication?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we accept that you can establish it by implication. As the Court said in College Savings Bank, it has to be an overwhelming implication.\n\nJudge: Right. But an implication could occur when what? It seems to me here that there is no mention of sovereign immunity, so we’re operating in implication land. The implication is coming from the creation of a cause of action that applies to the government. You're arguing as to whether or not it applies to the government. No, you're not?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we’re not arguing that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We have a different argument about whether the cause of action applies to the government.\n\nJudge: I see.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But this part of the argument --\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- we say even if you think \"person\" includes the government, all that does is show that the cause of action applies to the government.\n\nJudge: And isn’t that enough to be the implication?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Because the fact that you have a cause of action that covers a particular defendant doesn’t speak one way or the other to whether that defendant may have particular available defenses.\n\nNo one would think it's strange that this cause of action applies to private parties that violated FCRA more than five years ago.

{"id": "121", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, Your Honor, in Twitter, you were applying aiding-and-abetting principles that arose in the context of a murder when you were talking about social media platforms.\n\nJudge: I think the whole point of Twitter was that there is a set of general aiding-and-abetting principles, and that is the law that informs what aiding-and-abetting liability is.\n\nPlaintiff: But I thought we were --\n\nJudge: I don't even know how you would do this kind of statute-specific aiding-and-abetting liability outside of the general principles of aiding and abetting.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I -- I thought we were only looking at aiding and abetting to the extent that Congress mentions that in an example in the statute.\n\nPlaintiff: So what we're really doing is trying to understand what Congress intended with respect to the exception that it put in this statute.\n\nPlaintiff: And so, to the extent that it references aiding-and-abetting liability in one of the examples, that is just to illuminate the meaning of the statutory terms that exist there, right? I mean, it's sort of odd to me that suddenly a common law of aiding-and-abetting liability is coming in to, in your view, be dispositive of how we think about this case.\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nJudge: Well, I think that it's an example.\n\nJudge: The -- the reference to aiding and abetting in the statute is an example of a violation that then triggers the statutory exception and the proximate cause analysis.\n\nJudge: So you have to understand then what it means to aid and abet a particular crime. Again, I don't --\n\nPlaintiff: As Congress intended it for the purpose of this statute in --\n\nJudge: Well, and -- and -- and I think it's not that plausible to say that Congress had some completely idiosyncratic view of what aiding and abetting was for this statute as opposed to just looking to the principles like this Court looked to in Twitter, which are just the basic aiding-and-abetting principles that are covered in criminal law.\n\nPlaintiff: Can I ask you about the proximate cause because I'm still a little confused about where you start your proximate cause analysis.\n\nPlaintiff: I listened as you discussed with Justice Thomas the steps, the series of steps, from your clients to the alleged ultimate harm, but it seemed to me that the first moment of illegality in the chain, as you articulated it, was the retailers selling to the straw purchasers.\n\nPlaintiff: Am I right about that? You say your clients do things that are legal. They sell to --\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.\n\nPlaintiff: -- other legal buyers and -- et cetera, et cetera, until we get to that straw purchaser point, right?\n\nJudge: That is the first moment of illegality, but I don't think that's the sole step relevant to a general proximate cause analysis.\n\nPlaintiff: Right. But we don't have a general proximate cause analysis.\n\nPlaintiff: We have a statute.\n\nPlaintiff: And the statute makes clear that we're starting with an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\n\nPlaintiff: So it seems to me that the first step, given this statute, is the moment of violation, of illegality, as opposed to some theoretical original point.\n\nJudge: And my answer to that question is no, but it doesn't matter.\n\nPlaintiff: No --\n\nJudge: No --\n\nPlaintiff: I understand you think you make it anyway --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: -- but I'm just trying to understand why you --\n\nJudge: And it's because what the --\n\nPlaintiff: -- why you're insisting --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff: -- that it's way back here.\n\nJudge: Because what the statute says is there has to be a proximate cause between the defendant's violation. Our violation is not the illegal sale itself.\n\nJudge: We don't sell to consumers.\n\nPlaintiff: But you say you don't violate at the time the beginning. So I don't know what your violation is unless it's the point of illegality.\n\nJudge: It's the aiding and abetting. That is the whole aiding-and-abetting theory.\n\nPlaintiff: All right.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Ms. Stetson.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mexico's complaint pleads that Petitioners aided and abetted violations of specific federal gun laws and that those violations proximately caused Mexico's harm. That satisfies PLCAA's predicate exception.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: First, the complaint details that Petitioners deliberately supplied the illegal Mexican market by selling guns through the small number of dealers that they know sell a large number of crime guns and who repeatedly sell in bulk to the cartel traffickers.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Petitioners' arguments ignore these allegations.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Next, as the Court said in Twitter, an aider and abetter is liable for harms that were a foreseeable risk of that violation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That framing, foreseeable risk, is the proximate cause question.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: As this Court put it in Bank of America, does the harm alleged have a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits? The answer is yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The laws broken here are designed to keep guns out of criminals' hands.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Those violations put guns in criminals' hands and those criminals harmed Mexico.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Petitioners' arguments would rewrite PLCAA and proximate cause law far beyond this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Petitioners argue that independent criminal acts sever the causal chain. But an independent act, criminal or not, only breaks the causal chain if it is not foreseeable. These acts were foreseeable.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Petitioners argue that Mexico's injury is not direct.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But their directness argument borrows from cases involving indirect victims. Mexico is not an indirect victim.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We are here at the beginning of the beginning of this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: This Court need not vouch for Mexico's allegations, but it must assume they are true.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And the issue at this stage is not whether every aspect of Mexico's complaint survives but whether any of it clears the predicate exception.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mexico should be given a chance to prove its case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I welcome the Court's questions.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "651", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: Well, as I said, it speaks in terms of compensation in terms of defining the right, which is not to have property taken without just compensation. But that footnote, I think it's important to understand the context of that footnote. In fact, all of First English was about the Agins rule in California, which said there was not even a taking. Sometimes they said no compensation, but there was no taking until a court first determined that there was a taking.\n\nAnd that was the rule, that was the controversy at the time, the so-called temporary taking. Does the taking arise in a regulatory context at the time the regulation is effective or later? That was the issue that the Court rejected, and in that respect, it said no, compensation is owed from the moment of the Constitution.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: I have a little trouble understanding your argument about the Tucker Act. In your view, neither the Tucker Act nor the Takings Clause provides a cause of action, but then you say the combination of the two somehow provides a cause of action.\n\nAnd the Petitioner says that what you're saying is that nothing plus nothing equals something. So this—you must be relying on some kind of higher math that I can't understand.\n\nWhere—what is the cause of action in a Tucker Act suit?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: Suppose that the Takings Clause was not in the Constitution, but Congress enacted a statute that said the federal government shall not take private property for public use without just compensation.\n\nWould that be a money-mandating statute that creates a cause of action?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so. It's a prohibition, I think it's the same as the Fifth Amendment itself. It is a directive to Congress or the executive not to take property without affording compensation.\n\nNow it may be that the particular statute would be understood or could be interpreted that way, but here, we're talking about the Constitution, and no other provision of the Constitution provides of its own force a remedy, particularly a remedy for damages.\n\nAnd that would have been extraordinary at the time the Constitution was adopted because of the Appropriations Clause, sovereign immunity, and the Debt Clause.\n\nIf compensation is not paid, that is a debt of the United States, and it's clear—\n\nJudge: I find it hard to understand how that would not be a statute that mandates the payment of money. It says you can't take property for a public use without just compensation.\n\nIt's talking about paying money. If that's not a money-mandating provision, then—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It might be—it might be money-mandating under the Tucker Act. I think I understood you to say this wasn't the Tucker Act.\n\nJudge: No.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But that's because the Tucker Act has been under—\n\nJudge: It's another statute, and we would interpret it like we interpreted the statute in Maine Community Health.\n\nDoes it mandate the payment of money? I would think the answer to that would be yes. And if that's the case with the statute, why isn't it the same with the Fifth Amendment?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because money mandating is not something under the Tucker Act. It is a provision in the Tucker Act that—\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's not—it's not the other statute. It's a provision in the Tucker Act. And that is a Tucker Act-specific standard for when Congress—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. [Lawyer], I thought your answer to Justice [Judge] was going to be going back to what you said at the beginning, which is the compensation is conditional in the same way as the Due Process Clause is conditional.\n\nI thought that was very interesting, and maybe you want to repeat it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah. No, no, that—I think that's a fundamental point about the text, not just of the just compensation clause itself, but the entire Fifth Amendment is prohibitory.\n\nI mentioned the indictment clause, but the self-incrimination clause is the same way. The Double Jeopardy Clause is the same.\n\nJudge: And so, to the extent that we see a condition there, you're not interpreting that as mandating that condition necessarily. It's about the prohibition?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. Exactly.\n\nIf I could—I'm sorry. If I could go back to the Chief Justice's question about First English, the language in that footnote is directed to, it says, remedial. But what it is referring to is the computation of just compensation as a remedial matter.\n\nIf you have a cause of action, how do you calculate the remedy? All of the cases, it says, as the cases in the text make clear, it’s a remedy, and it does provide a basis for compensation, but in a cause of action where there already is one.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Every one of the cases the Court cited—\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Everybody understands that the carriers are doing it because the U.S. government, the Congress, the FCC, and then -- and then the particular administrative entity that's been set up pursuant to the statutory scheme, you know, that's -- you know, that's where the directive is coming from.\n\nThat's who's responsible for schools getting what they're getting.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nAnd Congress made the choice to set up the system to -- to deliver those -- those resources, those important resources, and it made choices.\n\nIt chose to require the private telecom carriers to pay. And the FCC made the choice to have a private administrator administer the system.\n\nAnd in that system that Congress designed, one consequence of that decision is that the public funds, which is the -- the cornerstone here of the False Claims Act, right, threat to the public fisc is never implicated, and so one consequence that flows from those choices is the fall -- you -- you cannot have a False Claims Act.\n\nBut, as I was -- as I was talking with the Plaintiff's Lawyer about, that does not mean that the fund is left without protections.\n\nThere are a toolbox of tools, everything from fees and fines to disbarment from the program.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But, Ms. Ho, it doesn't say that the threat -- I mean, clearly, one purpose is to protect the public fisc.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But, I mean, also protecting federal programs could be a purpose. I mean, so you can't rely just, I think, on that one purpose to narrow it.\n\nAnd it also seems at least for the post-2009 claims that there's some tension between the addition saying that it doesn't matter if the money -- if the United States has title to the money or property, but defining it as public funds implies that is so.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I mean, St. Paul Mercury is a little bit different because it's diversity.\n\nJudge: And there's always been a problem, you know, when I used to teach diversity jurisdiction, in the amount in controversy and figuring out how to value it.\n\nJudge: And you're not capped to the damages that you claim.\n\nJudge: And so there wasn't a real change there.\n\nJudge: And, you know, Cohill, okay, it's -- it's helpful, but it's really about a different point.\n\nJudge: It's about dismissal versus remand.\n\nJudge: I think the best thing for you are all these court of appeals cases.\n\nJudge: I mean, I -- I have a lot of trouble with the textual argument for the reasons Justice Kagan is saying, but, I mean, it does give me some pause to say, well, all these courts of appeals have thought this was okay and there is that footnote in Rockwell, but it's not quite the old soil principle because the old soil principle requires you to be able to hang your hat on something in the statute and say this is what brought along the old soil with it.\n\nJudge: So you cite Taggart and the old soil principle, but what are you attaching it to as opposed to just some sort of, like, free-floating, everyone thought we could do this?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So we totally agree, Your Honor, it has to be important that for decades and decades and decades every court of appeals has gone the same way.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We disagree, Your Honor, that Cohill didn't address this question.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It does say that when a federal law claim is eliminated at an early stage of the litigation, the district court has a powerful reason to choose.\n\nJudge: To choose its dicta, its dicta.\n\nJudge: Just go with my old soil question.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So -- so I think it is important here that Congress whole swath took parts of Gibbs and Cohill and the lower court cases prior to the enactment of the statute.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So Section (a) as well as Sections (c)(2) and (3) are word for word from Gibbs.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The top part of Section (c), the district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, that's drawn directly from Cohill.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And (c)(1), where it talks about the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law, that comes from 1980s court of appeals decisions that took that into account when determining whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So this --\n\nJudge: Your -- your briefing, obviously, suggests at least at the outset you don't think Grable has much to do with this case.\n\nJudge: And your friend on the other side obviously disagrees.\n\nJudge: But I wonder why it -- it doesn't.\n\nJudge: I mean, your reading, I think, assumes the correctness of your position under 1367 that this complaint is one over which the district court would have original jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: And your friend, I think, has concluded that depends upon whether Grable is correct.\n\nJudge: And so why -- why isn't it -- why doesn't it depend upon Grable?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So this Court can decide jurisdictional issues in any order. That's what it held in Sinochem.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We agree that there has to be an adjudication of the Grable question in order to get to the ultimate, you know, remedy in this case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But that's not what we're asking this Court to decide.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So we don't think the Court has to decide the issue.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If the Court wants to decide the issue, we think there plainly was jurisdiction based on the original complaint. The original complaint repeatedly claims that there are violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and then in paragraphs 136 and 137 of the complaint asks for an injunction requiring ongoing compliance with federal law.\n\nJudge: Well, the original complaint but not the removed complaint.\n\nJudge: In other words, not the complaint with all the federal things stripped out of it.\n\nJudge: In that situation, if that's the one you look at, then Grable is critical to your success, I think.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Just to be clear, so the -- the complaint at the time of removal had a federal claim, you know, that's our position.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, yes, of course.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And -- and this Court has long held that you don't have to have a federal question at all stages of the case in order to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's exactly what the Court held in Rosado, where the original federal claim became moot, and this Court said that the three-judge district court could continue to go on and decide the ancillary claims even though it didn't have original jurisdiction because you don't have to have jurisdiction over the original federal claim through all proceedings.\n\nJudge: In -- in 2007, in Rockwell, in Footnote 6, the statement there resolves this case in your favor, Footnote 6.\n\nJudge: Now the other side's going to say a lot of things about Footnote 6, I think, that it's dicta, that it's mistaken, that it's wrong, that it should be ditched.\n\nJudge: You want to just take on Footnote 6? Because you win with Footnote 6, but --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So we --\n\nJudge: -- is there -- you know, do we stick with that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We think Footnote 6 is not dicta.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We think it's actually quite essential to answering the question that Your Honor was asking: Why do we treat these two circumstances differently?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And you have to remember, prior to Rockwell, this Court had not addressed cases that were originally filed in federal court.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So this Court was trying to explain we have a hundred years where we do something different in the removal context.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Why are we going to do something different here? And Justice Scalia was explaining the different policy concerns.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So we don't think that's dicta.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We actually think it is essential to the reasoning in that case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And even if you think it isn't a holding, it certainly is recognizing that this Court has resolved the question in the removal context going all the way back to --\n\nJudge: Ms. Wellington --\n\nJudge: And why is it correct --\n\nJudge: Go ahead.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Because I think part of the premise of all of this, right, is that there are not enough beds for homeless people to occupy, and so there will be a mismatch, and there are going to be some people who can't be cared for.\nAre you saying that if your law is enforced, there is a way for everyone to be cared for?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\nI'm saying that's a policy question that is quite difficult, but these laws are an important part of the puzzle. They're not the only solution.\nAnd we don't believe that they are, but we think they're an important tool.\nAnd without them, we've seen what's happened on our streets. We've seen that people are dying in encampments.\nWe've seen that cities are being forced to cede all of their public spaces.\nSo that ultimate question is for the legislature and policymakers to figure out what the right solution, what the right mix of policies is.\nBut the wrong answer is to do what the lower court did here and to constitutionalize—\n\nJudge: Okay.\nLet me interrupt you there.\nYou're right, it's a very, very difficult policy question.\nAnd I asked you before about whether this was just about blankets or whether it went into having fires or urinating and defecating outdoors and that sort of thing, and another judge pointed out that this particular injunction did carve out those things and was just talking about sleep.\nBut, you know, other cases have been litigated in the lower court that have gone beyond that, and because the line is things that are involuntary, that are human needs, it can extend—it's difficult to draw the line, and whatever we decide here about this case is about the line.\nSo can you describe for me some of the things that are difficult to figure out about the line? There's sleeping.\nThere's sleeping with blankets.\nWhat else?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Public urination and defecation, that is a serious problem.\nThose are parts of biological necessities of being human.\nA court in another jurisdiction addressed that, and the lower court's opinions debated whether its rule would actually reach those things.\nI think any rule that we are wondering about and debating whether it would go that far, I think that is a sign that it is not a workable rule.\nThe slippery slope here is very real. It's not just for camping and conduct that might be a biological necessity, putting aside tents and fires and cold climates.\nWhat other things would be allowed? All of the things that a human needs to survive, for example, potentially come into focus under the lower court’s rule but also in other areas.\nSomeone could say that my drug use or possession is the other side of the coin because I'm an addict or because a person who violates other laws could say that I had a compulsion to do those things that I couldn't control.\nAnd the plurality opinion in a prior case addressed that very thing and why it's so important to draw the line there.\nAnd when conduct is involved and once the Court gets into deciding which conduct may be excused under the Constitution, it is so far afield of what the Constitution was ever understood to address.\n\nJudge: Okay.\nSpeaking of status and conduct, you've argued that a previous ruling was wrong and we don't need to overrule it.\nAnd I agree.\nI don't think we should overrule it.\nYou've also been kind of resisting characterizing anything other than the drug addiction that was at issue in that case as status.\nSo what if the law said it is unlawful and punishable by 30 days in prison to have the status of homelessness? Just go with me.\nJust assume that the law defines homelessness as a status and it is a status.\nWould that ruling say that law is unconstitutional under the Constitution? Would you concede that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And you're saying that that is a status?\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, yes, and I think it looks a lot like that prior ruling under that hypothetical, but, of course, we disagree that it is—\n\nJudge: I understand you disagree—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —a status in that way.\n\nJudge: —but you are accepting that the prior ruling draws a distinction between status and conduct, and you're just fighting about the definition of a status?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It draws the line where a law has no actus reus.\nSo I think that's the easiest line.\nI don’t defend the line under the Constitution because I don't think actually that the Court—I know the Court didn't rely on any Constitutional principles or history of—\n\nJudge: But the hypothetical I just gave you had no actus reus either.\nThe status of homelessness, I mean, it could be, you know, 4:00 in the afternoon and the person is just standing outside the bus stop.\nDo you agree that if the law prohibited that, made that a crime, that under the prior ruling, whether it was right or wrong, that under that ruling, that would be a violation of the Constitution?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think the better framework is due process.\n\nJudge: I understand that. Under that prior ruling, do you agree that that would be wrong?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice, would you like to ask questions?\n\nJudge: So picking up where the previous question left off, you say that the ordinance here pertains to conduct and not to status, and I'm just trying to figure that out.\nI'm not so sure for this reason. It's because all humans engage in the act in question, sleeping.\nAnd yet the statute operates or the ordinance operates to penalize only certain individuals, those who have no choice but to do that act in public.\nSo it appears, I think, not to be the act that the state or the city in this case finds criminally culpable.\nIt's instead the act as engaged in by certain people, by people who cannot afford housing and have nowhere else to go.\nSo why is that the wrong way to think about it? And if that is the right way to think about it, why isn't that a status crime in the way that previous rulings contemplate?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's not because we can look at the law and it has a conduct element.\nThe conduct is establishing a place—a campsite.\nAnd that is something that a person who has a home or a shelter could do as well.\n\nJudge: But you've just defined away the basic actus reus, right? The actus reus is sleeping out—I guess outside to the extent you put outside in it, but that's the problem I'm talking about.\nThe actus reus is the sleeping, right? Everybody—that's not a criminally culpable kind of activity.\nThat's what I think might distinguish it from prior cases and make it worse for you in a way because, in prior cases, at least, to the extent someone had a disease, and the question was, well, are they engaging in otherwise criminally culpable conduct, buying and selling drugs, taking drugs, you know, we look at that kind of category of things.\nHere, the actus reus is sleeping, human, universal.\nThe city adds, okay, but you can't sleep outside.\nAnd I guess what I'm trying to understand is, to the extent that that only happens with respect to a certain category of people who have no other place to go, why isn't that really just punishing the status of being someone who doesn't have any place to go?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It doesn't apply only to those people...\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And maybe the State can prove it up and show they have an important state interest and they really have a reason to distinguish between who can have these drugs for which purposes based on their sex. But that doesn't eliminate the facial sex classification or provide a reason for this Court to turn its back on 50 years of precedent saying, if you classify based --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- on sex, you have to justify that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And it's interesting to me that you mentioned precedent because some of these questions about sort of who decides and the concerns and legislative prerogatives, et cetera, sound very familiar to me. They sound in the same kinds of arguments that were made back in the day, the '50s, '60s, with respect to racial classifications and inconsistencies. I'm thinking in particular about Loving, and I'm wondering whether you've thought about the parallels, because I see one, as to how this statute operates and how the anti-miscegenation statutes in Virginia operated?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. And I think the Court has recognized that the Equal Protection Clause was -- was intended to force some changes in society and get us to think more closely about the way that people were being classified, including when that was based on overbroad generalizations of how we expect them to -- to live and order their affairs. And the Court has made that clear in the sex discrimination cases as well, where --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- it said sometimes these laws operate to disadvantage someone who falls outside the average description, and that person needs the protection of the courts.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, and a thing I thought was most interesting about the potential comparison to Loving is that in that case, everyone seemed to concede upfront that a racial classification was being drawn by the statute. That was sort of like the starting point. The question was whether it was discriminatory because it applied to both races and it wasn't, you know, necessarily invidious or whatever. But, you know, as I read the statute here, the -- excuse me, the case here, you know, the Court starts off by saying that Virginia is now one of 16 states which prohibit and punish marriages on the basis of racial classifications. And when you look at the structure of that law, it looks in terms of -- you know, you can't do something that is inconsistent with your own characteristics. It's sort of the same thing. So it's interesting to me that we now have this different argument, and I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument the way that Tennessee is in this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. I think that's exactly right, that there is absolutely a parallel between any law that says you can't act inconsistent with a protected characteristic. And, in all other contexts, the Court has recognized that as a facial classification based on that characteristic. And Tennessee even concedes the point when it comes to dress codes and to seeking a profession inconsistent with sex. But I think one other way to look at this, Justice Jackson, is that, to me, it would be a remarkable proposition for this Court to say that a statute that on its face says you can't have medications inconsistent with your sex, and in part, that's because we want you to appreciate your sex, isn't drawing a sex-based line in the first place. That would have no correspondence to or grounding in the text of the statute or how it works in operation or what effects it produces for individuals on the ground.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Strangio.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On its face, SB1 bans medical care only when it is inconsistent with a person's birth sex. An adolescent can receive medical treatment to live and identify as a boy if his birth sex is male but not female. And an adolescent can receive medical treatment to live and identify as a girl if her birth sex is female but not male. Tennessee claims the sex-based line-drawing is justified to protect children. But SB1 has taken away the only treatment that relieved years of suffering for each of the adolescent plaintiffs. And, critically, Tennessee's arguments that SB1 is sex-neutral would apply if the State banned this care for adults too. By banning treatment only when it allows an adolescent to live, identify, or appear inconsistent with their birth sex, SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny under decades of precedent. Because the Sixth Circuit failed to apply that standard, this Court should vacate and remand.

To the extent there was a suggestion that there could be an injunction to pay money, we would disagree with that because of the Appropriations Clause, I think.

And just to clarify your answer to the previous question in my head, you're saying it's the Tucker Act plus the statute—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: —mandating payment that gets you into court?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is—that's—that's correct, and it's certainly not the—it's certainly not the other provision itself, the just—the just compensation clause or the other statute, which by definition—\n\nJudge: So that's your half-point/half-point—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: —equals one?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sorry.\n\nJudge: Any other questions?\n\nJudge: Two questions. First, the rogue state example—why shouldn't we worry about that? Why shouldn't we worry about the incentive structure we create that would allow states to withdraw compensation schemes, and maybe the federal government too, to exploit this loophole?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: With respect, it's not a loophole. It's a—it's a fundamental aspect of the Constitution that the Constitution does not—does not require this. And the rogue state is answered by the fact that it's a prohibition, and if—if Congress does not provide the condition necessary to render it lawful, you have an injunction—injunctive action. And as the Court said in Knick, that was the way—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —that just compensation issues were raised before.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then, second, this may be a question better directed to the other party when they speak on rebuttal, but the procedural history of this case is interesting. The complaint has two counts about takings. One is under the state constitution, and the other is under the federal Constitution.\n\nHow do we read what the Fifth Circuit did here? Did it only dismiss the second, the federal claim, and is the first claim under, what is it, City of Bayview and the Texas Constitution, still live? Do they even need to amend their complaint to add it? Is it already there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There's a footnote in the court of appeals' opinion that says that the Texas Constitution or Texas provides a cause of action. And that is not further elaborated upon, but it's—\n\nJudge: No. Exactly.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —it's remanded for further proceedings.\n\nJudge: So do you take it that that first count under the state constitution is still alive and available to the plaintiffs?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—it is still alive and available. If it required an amendment to the complaint, I—\n\nJudge: Do you think it requires an amendment—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: —to the complaint, or because it was remanded for further proceedings and the court only expressly addressed the federal Constitution, that that first count is still alive?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it would depend on whether that first count, in— in relying on the state constitution, was just relying on a state substantive right to compensation or whether it was also relying—\n\nJudge: Well, Texas—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —on a cause of action.\n\nJudge: —has represented to us that it provides a cause of action—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. And—\n\nJudge: —right? So—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —so, yes, if—if—if the complaint is read to be invoking the state cause of action for the federal taking, then, yes, I think that would be open on remand.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "871", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-175, City of Grants Pass versus Johnson.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Like cities nationwide, Grants Pass relies on camping laws to protect its public spaces. These generally applicable laws prohibit specific conduct and are essential to public health and safety.\nThe Ninth Circuit tied cities' hands by constitutionalizing the policy debate over how to address growing encampments.\nIts holding that the Eighth Amendment bars Grants Pass from enforcing its camping laws is wrong for three reasons.\nFirst, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause governs which punishments are permitted, not what conduct can be prohibited.\nSecond, no precedent supports the Ninth Circuit's rule.\nRespondents and the United States abandoned its reliance on Powell. Instead, they misread Robinson to bar any punishment for involuntary conduct that's linked to a status.\nBut Robinson held only that states cannot outlaw the status of drug addiction. It made clear that they can prohibit conduct like drug use.\nThis Court should not rewrite Robinson six decades later.\nThird, the Ninth Circuit's approach has proven unworkable. The Eighth Amendment does not tell courts who is involuntarily homeless, what shelter is adequate, or what time, place, and manner regulations are allowed.\nBut, in 35 suits and counting, federal courts are now deciding everything from the exact size of campsites in San Rafael to the adequacy of empty beds at specific shelters, like the Gospel Rescue Mission in Grants Pass.\nCities are struggling to apply arbitrary, shifting standards in the field.\nThis Court should reverse and end the Ninth Circuit's failed experiment, which has fueled the spread of encampments while harming those it purports to protect. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Do you consider these civil or criminal penalties?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They are both.\n\nJudge: Is that involved in this case?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: To what extent? I mean, has any of the Petitioner's -- any of the parties here been subject to criminal trespass?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, they are at issue in the case. The district court enjoined them. And, yes, they do apply here. They are for recidivist offenses.\n\nJudge: But which party has been held accountable for criminal trespass?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: None of the individuals who are currently in the case.\n\nJudge: So what's involved in this case?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: For Logan and Johnson, the civil penalties.\n\nJudge: And so what -- is it the anti-camping, or what is it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: So that's civil, or is it criminal?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The camping ordinance is civil. And then, for repeat offenders, it's punishable by criminal trespass.\n\nJudge: But we're not talking about repeat offenders right now, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: So then have we ever applied the Eighth Amendment to civil penalties?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Not the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, no.\n\nJudge: Counsel, what will the City do if you don't prevail here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The City's hands will be tied. It will be forced to surrender its public spaces, as it has been. Unfortunately, beds are going unused at the Gospel Rescue Mission. People are not getting the help that they need.\nThe City is under an injunction here and is unable to rely on these basic ordinances.\nThe Ninth Circuit's decisions give cities like Grants Pass no guidance about how they can navigate this very challenging area.\nThe Ninth Circuit has effectively imposed a municipal code under the Ninth Circuit's Martin rule to regulate what the City can do in its public spaces.\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I just stop you a moment? The Gospel unused beds, they're less than a hundred, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: And there are thousands of homeless?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: There are, I believe, as many as 600 in Grants Pass according to the district court.\n\nJudge: But there are still only less than a hundred beds?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That is right.\n\nJudge: Now, can I stop you a moment? You are not asking us to overturn Robinson, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We think Robinson was wrongly decided and should not be extended, but we don't think that the Court needs to overrule it here.\n\nJudge: All right. Assuming it's there, it prohibits you criminalizing homelessness, right? So what you do is say only homeless people who sleep outdoors will be arrested?\nThat's the testimony of your chief of police and two or three officers.\nIf you read the crime, it only stops you from sleeping in public if you do so for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.\nThe police officers testified that means if a stargazer wants to take a blanket or a sleeping bag out at night to watch the stars and falls asleep, you don't arrest them.\nYou don't arrest babies who have blankets over them.\nYou don't arrest people who are sleeping on the beach.\nYou only arrest people who don't have a second home. Is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: Who don't have a home?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. These laws are generally applicable. They apply to everyone.\n\nJudge: Yeah, that's what you want to say.\nGive me one example, because your police officers couldn't.\nThey explicitly said that if someone has another home and is out there and happens to fall asleep, they won't be arrested.\nFall asleep with something on them.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

What about the question of how the jury would be instructed on the question of whether prior offenses occurred on the same occasion? That was a vexing issue in a previous case, and I think the Court's opinion was well-crafted and nuanced, but I would be hard-pressed to reduce it to an instruction that would be easily intelligible to a jury. It's a multi-factor question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the jury instruction --\n\nJudge: Have you given any -- could you give us a model jury instruction on this or do you have some idea how a jury could grapple with this question?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think those exist, Your Honor, and they just mostly track the language in the Court's opinion.\n\nSo the question for the jury overall, of course, is whether these prior offenses were committed on different occasions, which, as the Court put it in that case, turns on whether it was a single criminal episode or not. Then there are the factors: temporal proximity, geographic proximity, and the nature and relationship to the offense.\n\nI think it's similar to other kinds of qualitative elements that juries sometimes find. Mens rea can sometimes be highly qualitative, materiality in a fraud case can be multi-factored in certain ways.\n\nJudge: But those are not multi-factored determinations. Mens rea, you're asking the jury to determine what is in the defendant's mind. People make judgments about what is in the mind of other people all the time. That's a common experience.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I think what you had --\n\nJudge: Materiality, I can't think of something offhand -- maybe you can -- that's quite as multi-dimensional and nuanced as this.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think maybe one way to think about it, Your Honor, is you have a top-line finding that needs to be made, which is different occasions or a single criminal episode.\n\nAnd then you have subsidiary facts that feed into that ultimate finding. And that's just -- you know, that's like most of the things, I think, we were just talking about, which is a top-line finding and then subsidiary facts.\n\nAnd just so you have an opinion in the previous case that makes -- you know, kind of lays out those various facts, the jury could be instructed to consider those things.\n\nJudge: So the judge says the temporal factor -- I don't want to dwell too much on this, but it will turn out to be important if you prevail. Temporal proximity is important.\n\nAnd so then the jury says: Well, what does that mean? They had to occur on different days, different weeks? And what's the judge supposed to say?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think --\n\nJudge: Well, that's up to you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right. And I think the judge would say --\n\nJudge: It's up to you?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In that situation, something like, the ultimate question you're asking is whether this is a single criminal episode or not when you consider these three prior offenses.\n\nJudge: So then they say, well, what is a criminal episode? How do you define a criminal episode?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think we're repeating the same argument here.\n\nJudge: I know. That's the problem. (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think an episode involves sort of a single coherent plan or experience or event.\n\nJudge: Like a whole criminal enterprise? That's a single criminal episode?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so.

I -- I think that might be the statute we cited.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nAnd -- and then, for aiding and abetting, it would be 18 U.S.C.\n\nSection 2, I think.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI think that's right, yeah.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nI just want to be clear on what -- what is being alleged.\n\nAnd then your friends on the other side make a good point about our precedent in Direct Sales, which I did not write either and is about 80 years old too.\n\nI want to give you an opportunity to respond to Direct -- that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSure.\n\nI --I will agree with them on one point, that Direct Sales is their single best case.\n\nAnd Direct Sales isn't even close.\n\nIn Direct Sales, you had a manufacturer that was selling to a specific doctor in such massive quantities that there was no possible lawful explanation.\n\nAnd, in addition, the manufacturer then further encouraged that doctor to buy more by offering it massive discounts on bulk purchases.\n\nSo, to use the language of Twitter, you had both a very high degree of scienter and a very high degree of conduct and encouragement.\n\nJudge\nWell --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nNothing like that here.\n\nJudge\n-- that raises another question I had, and then I'll stop.\n\nBut, in terms of aiding and abetting under Section 2 for 922 if that's what we're talking about, those are criminal statutes.\n\nAnd Rosemond says that aiding and abetting in the criminal arena generally requires intent, not knowledge.\n\nBut you didn't make anything of that.\n\nCan you just --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell, Your Honor, I think that because they don't come anywhere close on any standard, whether you call it knowledge, whether you call it intent -- remember, in Rosemond, the defendant was actually part of the drug transaction.\n\nThe question was, did Rosemond, in participating in that drug transaction, also know that one of his collaborators was going to shoot somebody? You don't have anything like that here.\n\nThe other respect in which this is far different from Twitter in a way that also highlights Direct Sales is that in Twitter, the defendants there were far more active.\n\nWe were here just a few weeks ago talking about algorithms.\n\nThe way that algorithms work is that they match up the creator's content with the user's interests.\n\nSo it starts out with ISIS's vile content.\n\nIt surveys the billions of users on the platform, figures out which ones are actually interested in that content, and puts the two together.\n\nWe're not doing anything even like that.\n\nThis is an a fortiori case after Twitter.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nCounsel, the complaint says that 2 percent of the guns manufactured in the United States find their way into Mexico, and I know you dispute that, but is there a number where your legal analysis might have to be altered? If it's 10 percent, if it's 20 percent? At some point, the proximate cause lines that you draw really can't bear the weight of the ultimate result.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSo, Your Honor, if we're -- I take their complaint as it comes.\n\nIf we're talking about proximate cause, I don't think that the percentage would actually matter when you have a multitude of intervening independent crimes.\n\nIn Hemi, for example, I don't think it matter -- would matter whether the city was losing -- whether everybody was not paying their taxes in New York City or just a small percentage were not paying their taxes in New York City.\n\nWhat mattered is that you had the independent decision of the New York City taxpayers not to pay their taxes that broke that chain.\n\nHere, you have a multitude of intervening independent crimes.\n\nSo I don't think that percentage would matter at all on my proximate cause analysis.\n\nJudge\nWell, I mean, at some --at some point, it must matter.\n\nI mean, I understand you don't want to -- your theory about the different steps, but if it ends up that most of your product or whatever number you want to get to a change in your view ends up there, you've got to know that.\n\nAnd if you know that, do you still have to go through the intricate step -by -step -by-step --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI --\n\nJudge\n--or can you just say this is what they make --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\n-- and pick whatever number you want, 70 percent of it ends up in Mexico?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI --I still think you do have to go through that analysis, Your Honor. But, even if you disagree with me, I'm willing to accept the allegations in their complaint and the number of 2 percent and to be quite confident that that is not enough for proximate cause, particularly when their theory is that simply because a firearm was found in Mexico at a crime scene and can ultimately trace -- be traced back to a particular retailer that sold it in the first instance, that means that the retailer illegally sold it and that we knew the retailer illegally sold it.\n\nEven the ATF and the federal government rejects that theory.\n\nJudge\nThank you. Justice Thomas?\n\nJudge\nMr. Francisco, the -- in Direct Sales, there was exactly that, a direct sale to a doctor, and the seller worked closely with the doctor to work around the limitations.\n\nIn your brief, you summarized the chain that you've mentioned or alluded to a number of times.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\nWould you just list the chain for our benefit?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSure.\n\nIt starts out with a licensed manufacturer, a manufacturer that the federal government says is allowed to make firearms.\n\nIt then distributes its legal firearms to licensed distributors, distributors who the federal government says are allowed to distribute them.\n\nThey then sell to licensed retailers, retailers that the federal government says are allowed to retail.\n\nThose retailers, some very small percentage of them, an unknown number but a small percentage of them, transfer those firearms illegally to straw purchasers.\n\nThe straw purchaser then hands it over to the actual purchaser.\n\nYou then have a smuggle across an international border, yet another violation of law.\n\nThe smuggler then presumably gives it to the cartels who are illegally possessing the firearm in Mexico under Mexican law.\n\nThen the Mexican cartels engage in murder and mayhem against the good people of Mexico, all of which in turn causes the Mexican government to have to spend money to respond to that murder and mayhem.\n\nWith respect, there's not a single case in history that comes close to that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "34", "dialogue": "Judge: Four days. Okay. So would four days be an unreasonable length of time for a detention for the two misdemeanors?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's not that it would be an unreasonable length of time. It's that precedent says that the length of detention must be authorized by a neutral and detached magistrate. And here, a neutral and detached magistrate didn't authorize the detention or arrest for this length of time, especially considering that the felony charge was bogus.\n\nJudge: So you mean, just to make sure that I understand, it's possible that he could have been held for the four days if the magistrate had only considered the two misdemeanors, but you're saying that the presence of the third charge necessarily corrupts everything else and so the causation element doesn't apply there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's exactly right. And, again, the only published circuit court case analyzing this question came to that result. So we think this Court should weigh in on that question with the benefit of full briefing, argument, and historical analysis, which we don't believe is adequately presented here.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Another Judge?\n\nAnother Judge: Well, just out of curiosity, the four days are Friday to Monday, right? It's over the weekend?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nAnother Judge: And what happens in the city of Napoleon? I looked up how many people there are. It's not a big city, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right.\n\nAnother Judge: What happens with people who are arrested on a Friday?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, precedent says that a Florida statute that excludes weekends from the two-day calculation—\n\nAnother Judge: I mean, what actually happens in that town?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So—\n\nAnother Judge: All right. That's irrelevant. I'm just curious about the facts of this case. This is a strange little incident. Why didn’t your client just give the police officers the ring?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, he asked for the opportunity to consult with counsel because the hold letter was ambiguous. It said both to hold this as evidence and to return it.\n\nAnother Judge: I know. There’s strange behavior on both sides, but when the police officers are there and say, \"Give the ring to the people,\" why doesn’t he just do it? He paid $45 for it, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor—\n\nAnother Judge: What did he think was going to happen? That something bad was going to happen to him because he had an ambiguous letter that said \"hold the ring or give the ring to them\"? Did he think something terrible was going to happen if he gave them the ring when the police were telling him to do so?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, maybe that goes to why the Sixth Circuit found probable cause for the retaining stolen property charge, but it has nothing to do with felony money laundering.\n\nAnother Judge: No, I—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And it certainly doesn’t—\n\nAnother Judge: I understand. And this is not really a money-laundering statute, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s correct, Your Honor. It’s about purchasing with knowledge. And even if Your Honor is correct, and I just want to clarify that the facts aren’t exactly as Your Honor suggests, it certainly doesn’t justify the police officers doctoring a report, securing an arrest warrant, finding a way to detain him for four days—\n\nAnother Judge: No, no.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —and seizing his property.\n\nAnother Judge: I’m not arguing that. I’m just curious about the facts. You said they weren’t as I suggested. What did I get wrong?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It wasn’t that he refused to give back the jewelry. He asked for time to consult with counsel before doing so.\n\nAnother Judge: Okay.\n\nAnother Judge: Having worked many Saturday nights to arraign people before judges, that’s what some jurisdictions do. (Laughter.)\n\nAnother Judge: Lovely.\n\nAnother Judge: Another question—maybe an idiosyncratic one—but on this causation element, one way I think of it is this: malicious prosecution at common law was about protecting the judicial process. So your interpretation of causation makes a great deal of sense in that context—it doesn’t matter what actually happened. What mattered was that the process was tainted.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nAnother Judge: The problem is that we’ve applied malicious prosecution in the Fourth Amendment context. And a seizure has to be involved in the Fourth Amendment, because that’s what it addresses. So that’s where I struggle to reconcile the two. A malicious prosecution claim would naturally flow from the Due Process Clause and wouldn’t require proof beyond the tainted process.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nAnother Judge: But that’s not how we’ve structured it, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s correct.\n\nAnother Judge: So help me out with that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, first, that battle has been lost.\n\nAnother Judge: I understand that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But even setting that aside, precedent says that as a matter of the Fourth Amendment, process matters. For example, precedent allows warrantless arrests but requires bringing the person before a magistrate as soon as possible, certainly within 48 hours. And the precedent doesn’t say that if the person actually committed the crime, there’s no need to bring them before a magistrate. The focus is on the process.\n\nAnother Judge: See, that—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Even if the—\n\nAnother Judge: I completely agree on the due process side.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But precedent situates that right in the Fourth Amendment.\n\nAnother Judge: In the Fourth Amendment. Okay. Let me ask another question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nAnother Judge: So your client filed a straightforward malicious prosecution claim under common law in Count 1 and also brought this Fourth Amendment hybrid claim in Count 3, which then got removed to federal court.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "631", "dialogue": "udge: But, General, do you agree that if a state takes a person's property and doesn't give compensation, that state is violating the Constitution every day?

I don't think this Court's cases have ever --\n\nJudge: But that's what I want to know. It's an ongoing violation of the Constitution, right? I've taken the plaintiff's property. I haven't paid him. Every day, I'm violating the Constitution, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay. So aren't courts supposed to do something about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. And what this Court said in a previous case is, when there's not a cause of action, which remember there wasn't a cause of action, there were -- you have -- there's no remedies.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: What is injunctive relief --\n\nJudge: But this is -- this is very different.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: You know, in the usual case, we have a constitutional -- let's take a Fourth Amendment case. You know, it's you've searched somebody's home illegally.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: It's happened, and then it's over, and then the question is what remedy are you going to be giving for that violation. But this is a different kind of violation. It's not -- it's not even clear that the word \"remedy\" is appropriate here. It's a right to compensation. And the state, by taking the land and not compensating, is violating that right every day. It's not that the state --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\n\nJudge: -- is failing to provide a remedy. The state is violating the right to be paid.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor. And I -- I just -- and the answer would be, if there's not a cause of action, that's why I went back to the previous case.\n\nJudge: Well, if it's not a cause of action, I mean, in the --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: -- usual case, suppose that a state violates the plaintiff's First Amendment rights.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yep.\n\nJudge: Could he bring a suit about that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, for injunctive relief.\n\nJudge: Yes. And what the plaintiff is saying is that -- that the usual distinction that we draw, you can bring a suit for injunctive relief, but you can't bring a suit for damages, that's the usual distinction. But it sort of falls apart in this case because the right is a right to be paid.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. And so I -- I -- I come at this from maybe the other direction. Let's imagine that some government said, you know what, we're not going to pay. We're telling everybody now. Now you are on notice we are not paying. Well, then what happens? Before they could do anything, you would rush to court and you would say: Injunction. They can't do it. They've promised they're not going to pay. They're not going to provide that. And the Constitution says, if they don't, they're out -- they're violating their rights. That's from a previous case, where if it's clear that there's not going to be a right to judicial -- to payment, there are no -- no monies coming, not -- not judicial, but no payments coming, you can get that injunction right away.\n\nJudge: I mean, let me make the point another way.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: I mean, it's sort of backwards to say that the plaintiff can sue for an injunction, meaning like, you know, give me back my property. Actually, the state has a right to take his property or a prerogative to take --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- his property. If the state wants to use his property for a railroad, it doesn't really matter that the person doesn't want to sell. The state has the ability to take -- the only thing that the state does not have the prerogative to do and the thing that the landowner has a right to have is payment.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Haven't they said that -- that the determination that there was no exhaustion would not carry over, would not have an effect on the trial of the merits?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI -- I -- I agree. Collateral estoppel is not a bar here, but that's the reason why it's important to consider this, and that's why I believe this Court granted cert.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nMs. Sherman, would the same judge who made a determination in the exhaustion realm related to the facts of whether or not this person exhausted be presiding over the subsequent trial in which those same questions about what happened go to the jury?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI don't think there's any -- any rule that would require that the same judge hear that.\r\n\r\nIt could go to any judge --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI'm just asking you, as a matter of practice, wouldn't it --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI don't --I don't think a --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- would --don't judges -- don't judges ordinarily keep the case?

{"id": "272", "dialogue": "Judge:\nI think that the concern raised, though, is when the agency has said -- has approved the project and a court comes in and says -- in this new, as you say, suite of statutes era, and says even though the agency approved the project, even though the project and all the effects comply with all the substantive environmental laws that have been passed over the years, which regulate very extensively, obviously, we, court, are going to come in and second-guess. So I -- I don't think your answer focused on that particular problem and the deference given that -- maybe it's just extra deference given the -- the overall situation now.\n\nMaybe \"extra\" is the wrong word but just -- just appropriate deference.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo I think that where an agency recognizes that there is an environmental issue and that it will be dealt with in the mitigation process -- or, I'm sorry, in the review process by other agencies, which could be state or federal agencies, that rationale might well be -- be sufficient all by itself to -- to satisfy NEPA review, but what we're -- what we're discussing here is a different question, which is whether the ring fence around NEPA should be drawn so tightly that the agency doesn't have to ask that question at all. I mean, as I said a moment ago and I think this really is one of the most important pieces of this case, that how much the agency has to do under NEPA is different from saying that certain effects are beyond the scope of NEPA so that the opposing counsel’s aggressive view of harmless error can come in and over -- and fix an agency's flawed decision-making on grounds that the agency itself did not give. That -- that, I think, is -- is the core of the point, that even -- even where some agency has -- some other agency has responsibility, the first -- that agency is going to be at the table in the NEPA review. The first agency may well be able to rely on the -- on the agency with expertise in the NEPA review, and the flip side of that -- and this is made explicit in the 2023 amendments -- is that where the first NEPA review answers these questions, the second agency can look back to the first NEPA review and say we're all done here.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWe don't need another one.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, can I just give you a chance to answer what I think is the hardest part for you? And that is, if -- if the environmental impacts come from the cargo that is to be carried on these trains and the Board cannot, because of the common carrier mandate, really consider the cargo or discriminate on the basis of the cargo, then how is it that these environmental impacts are useful to the Board's decision-making in the way that NEPA requires?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo there -- as we -- as we've been discussing, there are three sets of -- three general sets of impacts.\n\nAnd I don't think that, for example, the wildfire set of impacts on the -- along the downline stretch, I don't think that's driven by the cargo, so let's bracket that for the moment. I think that in many cases, where you're building a railroad and the railroad will carry whatever -- whatever all comers want, whether it's passengers or freight, then the Board would be justified in saying this is a -- you know, this is a common carrier line.\n\nIt would be totally speculative to ask what cargo it will carry. In this case, it's not speculative at all because the entire purpose is to carry one set of cargo.\n\nAnd if you look at the -- at the record, you will see that --\n\nJudge:\nWould the Board be justified in saying we know what this cargo is, and because we can't discriminate on the basis of our common carrier mandate, there's no impact on our decision with respect to NEPA or whatever, and so, therefore, we don't have to study it?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo I think probably in the context of a project like this one, where the Board's mission is to weigh the transportation merits against the environmental consequences and the transportation merits are heavily weighted with the oil and gas -- the oil development in the basin, the economic value that it will create, and the -- the ability to unlock this important natural resource, we're -- we're -- we're not saying that the Board would conclude that the environmental consequences are too grave to -- to permit the railway as a matter of law or something like that. But we are saying that what environmental consequences would result foreseeably from carrying one cargo to particular destinations in very large quantities, that's foreseeable, whereas, as the Board said about the other things that -- that might go along on this rail line, we don't know what they might be.\n\nIt would be speculative -- it would be speculative to wonder what they might be, but we do know that there will be no trains carrying anything else -- let me say that more precisely.\n\nThere will be no trains carrying cargo other than oil and only cargo other than oil.\n\nEvery train leaving this basin is going to be carrying waxy crude oil.\n\nThere might be a little, you know -- one car tacked -- tacked on for something else if there were a -- a market for it. And so, under those circumstances where the rationale for the project is to permit unlocking more waxy crude oil development and where the -- where the Board's consideration of the benefits of the project is tied to the -- that oil development, it -- it follows that the Board would at least consider what the environmental consequences of doing so would be.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel. Justice, any questions?\n\nJudge:\nI do see that there are different questions here.\n\nYou mentioned the train accidents and the wildfire or pollution.\n\nNo one's ever -- I don't think Petitioner has ever said the agency should not study those things.\n\nThose are directly caused by the train, the project.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nOpposing counsel said that this morning, that it's --\n\nJudge:\nExactly.\n\nAnd so, really --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- you know, it's 88 -- outside the 88 miles.\n\nJudge:\n-- that's a different challenge as to whether they did it adequately or not, which is what the D.C. Circuit said, they didn't do it adequately.

Counsel for the Defendant.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, may it please the Court: Once more we confront the Armed Career Criminal Act, this time with regard to which drug schedules a sentencing court is to consult in order to determine whether a prior state drug crime is a match with those federal schedules and, thus, either is or is not a predicate under the ACCA. We submit that the sentencing court should use the schedules that are current at the time of sentencing.\n\nThat is because, at its core, the ACCA is a sentencing enhancement. It is not a crime unto itself.\n\nAnd this Court has said that the ordinary practice is to apply current law, including at sentencing. There's no reason to deviate from that ordinary practice here.\n\nThe statute is phrased in uniformly present terms.\n\nThe goal of the ACCA is to incapacitate only the most serious offenders.\n\nAnd, finally, to do otherwise, as the government suggests, would be to ignore entirely Congress's choice to change those drug schedules with the 2018 Farm Bill. With that, I invite the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, didn't we say in McNeill that looking at the statute is a backward-looking exercise?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You certainly did, Your Honor.\n\nAnd McNeill, however, is actually a complement in some sense for this case, not a barrier. The reason why I say that is that McNeill looked at the historical facts of the state crime.\n\nWe are now engaged in the present-tense effort to figure out what the federal sentence should be, including a potential ACCA mandatory minimum enhancement. McNeill acknowledged, as I just said, that the statute is phrased in the present tense, but McNeill found a particular problem, and that was that if a state reformulates its criminal laws—different prior state crimes could disappear because a court couldn't figure out under the new formulations what the maximum sentence would be.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you a question, and then I'll let you go. But what if, just say, using your logic and your approach, there was a crime—a state offense that was not on the schedule, it was not included on the controlled substance schedule, but then, subsequently, after the commission of the state crime but before sentencing, it's added? How would that work under your logic or your approach?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, if the government tried to make that a match, I think the defendant might have the opportunity to claim that that was an ex post facto application of the law.\n\nIn other words, it wasn't a match at the time of the offense, but it is now a match at sentencing. And we would say under our approach that, yes, it is a match, but the Ex Post Facto Clause would be a barrier to applying the newer drug schedules there.\n\nAnd, there, you would shift back to the drug schedules that apply at the time of the federal offense, the 922(g) offense.\n\nJudge: Isn't that an argument why your reading is strained? You're building in an ex post facto problem.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, respectfully, Your Honor, we're not building in an ex post facto problem because there already is an ex post facto problem.\n\nIn other words, we're not avoiding a constitutional question here.\n\nThis Court decided in Peugh that if, after the commission of the federal crime, the sentencing range shifted upward, that would be an ex post facto problem, and that was because of the way that the guidelines anchor the sentence. Certainly, here, where we have a statute and not any kind of discretionary exercise, there would be an ex post facto problem potentially with the application of the new drug schedules that had added drugs.\n\nJudge: Can I ask you what purpose your rule has to putting a defendant on notice as to what his potential liability may be at the moment he commits the federal offense? At that point, he has no idea what an enhancement may or may not be based on what conduct he committed in the state offense or even in the federal offense.\n\nI'm not sure what rule of interpretation would counsel that approach.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Respectfully, Your Honor, I think that's an odd conception of notice, to be honest with you.\n\nDue process notice problems arise when an offender can't tell where the law is and can't tell what the sentence is.\n\nIt doesn't usually arise if the offender gets a break on the way to the sentencing forum. That's what happened in Dorsey. That's what happened in Peugh. That's what happened in Concepcion.\n\nSo, if an offender gets a break on the way, the offender gets the opportunity to take advantage of that break to make the argument. We don't say that somebody who is on notice 10, 12, 15 years ago when they committed a state crime should have that crime—\n\nJudge: Except, counsel—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —or should have the whole thing—\n\nJudge: —that's the whole fallacy of sentencing enhancements, that somehow, because there's a potential for enhancement, there may be a decision by a defendant not to commit a crime. It's unlikely to ever really happen, but accepting that supposition, your rule doesn't do anything to enhance rejection of a criminal from committing a crime again.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think our rule does do something very important, which is to respect Congress's choice to change the drug schedules and to narrow the types of drugs that are going to go onto the federal schedule.\n\nAnd that, of course, affects the matching exercise. So our rule respects the change that Congress made in 2018.\n\nAnd with respect to the prior notice, as I said, I think it's an odd conception to say that you should be culpable for some future act that you had not even committed yet because you were on notice at that time.\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I ask you a question about the distinction between your approach and the time-of-federal-offense approach? Why does it make sense or why would it make sense for Congress to say that two defendants who were convicted at the exact same time should be sentenced differently simply by virtue of when their sentencing happened?\n\nI mean, doesn't the other approach—if we're not going to choose the government's approach—it just seems to me like the time-of-federal-offense approach makes more sense of the scheme.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, any line-drawing that's done with respect to the applicability or the matching exercise is going to create some arbitrariness. The Court acknowledged that in Dorsey.\n\nAnd, in fact, the same sort of hypothetical that Your Honor posed was discussed in McNeill and also in Dorsey, and the resolution there was that a time-of-sentencing approach uniformly—although arbitrary in some sense—at least anchors it in a way that is consistent throughout, and, according to the Court in Dorsey, removes some of the arbitrariness.\n\nJudge: And isn't that the standard way it's ordinarily done in the sentencing world? I mean, I understood that under the normal federal sentencing process, a federal judge applies the sentencing law at the time of sentencing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So, to the extent that we accept that this ACCA is a sentencing statute, then the normal course would be to apply a time-of-sentencing rule?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "410", "dialogue": "Judge: And Franklin, I think, is kind of our north star here at least as I've unpacked the case.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. But -- but I think Franklin, you could either read it as being a case about significant interference based on the record, as I pointed out, or I think what this Court said is it just engaged in statutory interpretation. It said we've got a federal statute that says national banks may accept savings deposits and the word \"savings\" matters. It's the label that Congress used for these accounts. And states can't pose a serious practical impediment to that by saying you can't use that same label. And so that case could be understood on statutory construction grounds based on the express statutory power that was granted by the statute, and we have nothing like that here.\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Anything further?\nJudge: Well, the way you just described Franklin sounds to me an awful lot like what the Second Circuit did here.\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\nJudge: They -- they -- they said that the bank has, the national bank has a certain power, and the state conditions the exercise of that national power on compliance with a state requirement, and that's enough to prove that there's preemption. That's what I just understood you to say.\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, Judge. If -- my understanding of what the --\nJudge: I must have -- maybe I -- I misunderstood you, so maybe you could just clarify.\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I was -- I was simply trying to clarify that Franklin National Bank could be understood based on specific statutory text that is nothing like any statutory text that Bank of America has identified.\nJudge: I thought you were saying -- and, again, correct me if I misunderstood you because it's important to my thinking about this -- that the issue -- that Franklin Bank can be understood as deciding this issue without examining the empirical question of the extent to which there was an impact on the operation of the bank. I thought that's what you said.\nDefendant's Lawyer: I guess I would put it a little -- little bit differently then, Judge. I think that the Court, in its opinion, it notes the -- the -- the record that had been amassed on this question as to the practical consequences of the law, and I think that record gave it some comfort and confirmed why it was significant that Congress would have used the statutory term \"savings.\" But, ultimately, its opinion rests on, you know, statutory analysis of the word \"savings\" and a specific statutory interpretation that is -- would present a sort of -- I mean, you could think of it as being a conflict in that -- in that sense and is nothing like the kind of conflict that we have here.\nJudge: All right. Thank you.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\nJudge: The government asked us to vacate and remand and let the Second Circuit apply whatever we say is the correct test.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hmm.\nJudge: You're asking us to reverse. What's the difference, and why don't we do what the -- the U.S. is recommending?\nDefendant's Lawyer: We would be happy with a vacatur, and I think it's the most modest way for this Court to decide the -- the question before it. The reason why we're asking for reversal is we think that as long as there's a requirement that the practical effect of the law be examined, that Bank of America has failed to make that showing, and since it's failed to make that showing, then its motion to dismiss should be denied, and it can make the showing at a later stage of the litigation or put in some declarations or something and seek summary judgment if it thinks it can meet --\nJudge: I don't know whether I --\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- the statutory --\nJudge: I mean --\nDefendant's Lawyer: But I don't think --\nJudge: -- the statute doesn't speak in terms of practical effects. It talks about preventing or significantly interfering with the exercise of a national bank power. So I do think that there is a difference between practical effect and that language.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that language, in ordinary parlance, could only be understood to -- to say that to be able to answer that question, you've got to know what the practical effect of the law is. And you don't have to necessarily know what the degree is. I mean, that -- you know, people can disagree about that, but, at a minimum, you've got to -- it's got to take some account of what the practical effect is. And once you recognize that --\nJudge: So your -- at what point -- you mentioned earlier that the OCC could decide some of these preemption issues because, under your take of this law now, that national banks -- all state laws would apparently apply to national banks, unless and until those banks obtain final judgments of preemption state by state, correct?\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that is correct, but --\nJudge: Now the other side is saying that's an alarming unpredictability. And some of my colleagues are concerned about that. Why don't you address that straight on and -- but you mentioned in your opening that you thought the OCC could do it. Well, the OCC has done it here. There's a question of whether they've applied the right standard in doing it.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\nJudge: But they have done it.\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the statute -- they haven't done it consistent with the procedures set up by the statute, and I don't even think Bank of America is arguing they've done it consistent with the procedures set up by -- by the statute. But if -- I think it would be appropriate for a court on remand to look at what the OCC has said about the effect of this law. You'll find that there's not much there in -- in either the 2011 rulemaking or the 2004 rulemaking or in the amicus brief that the OCC submitted below. But we think, you know, it would be appropriate for a court to consider that as part of the analysis.\nJudge: Whether we like the case-by-case approach, the statute requires it?\nDefendant's Lawyer: The statute requires it.\nJudge: I think I would have expected you to say that --\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh.\nJudge: -- to start off.\nDefendant's Lawyer: We -- we certainly think that you should read the statute and apply it as written.\nJudge: Okay. Could you give me an example of a non-discriminatory state law that would be preempted as a significant interference?\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't know that I can answer that question in the abstract. But, I mean, I -- well, I guess I can. Barnett Bank would be -- would be an example. So even if that's non-discriminatory, it poses a clear conflict because of the total --\nJudge: Yeah.

The federal court would just say there's no due process violation.\n\nIt's a great state agency. It's very effective.\n\nAnd we just want the state court to apply the same rule of decision, right? You don't have to exhaust, but your claim loses because you're getting plenty of process and there's no problem with the process.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nWell, then what was Kafkaesque about the process? I understood you to say that that was the problem, that it was -- it imposed a burden on your -- the exercise of your -- your federal right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nWhat was Kafkaesque is the ruling that we couldn't challenge our inability to exhaust precisely because we haven't exhausted.\n\nThat was the problem.\n\nLike, our -- the problem was we can't exhaust effectively, and the state court held that because you didn't exhaust --\n\nJudge:\nWell, but what if you can --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n-- you can't challenge that.\n\nJudge:\n-- what if you can exhaust effectively?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nWell, then you wouldn't have a -- a claim.\n\nI mean, I -- the problem is, as applied to this fact pattern, I think it doesn't make sense to apply an exhaustion requirement, and that's why we think that, as applied, effectively, what the statute is doing is granting the state immunity in the state courts from this.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nMy last question: You say \"as applied to this fact pattern.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo tell me what the particulars of this fact pattern are that may not be the case in other situations.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nThe particulars of this fact pattern is when the Petitioners are challenging their failure to exhaust and they're told that they can't challenge their failure to exhaust until they have, in fact, exhausted.\n\nThe problem with that is that as a practical matter, you're immunizing the state in the state court from the 1983 claim because you can't exhaust.\n\nSo you're incapable of challenging your inability to exhaust because the state is saying you have to exhaust until you can bring the challenge.\n\nSo there's no way to challenge in state court at all, and so it's a de facto immunity akin to the immunities that were in the Haywood and -- and the Howlett case.\n\nSo that's our -- our narrowest argument on this.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nCould you have sought mandamus in state court to get a ruling in these cases?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nSo --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nAn administrative ruling in these cases?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nSo there's a dictum that is cited by Respondent from a 1997 intermediate appellate court case that says that, in principle, mandamus could be available if an agency intentionally sits on a claim and drags its feet, but no mandamus claim was asserted there. I -- I think mandamus wouldn't be very effective in this case for a few reasons.\n\nSo, first of all, of course, you have to show a clear and indisputable right to the writ, which is a higher standard than in an ordinary civil case.\n\nAlso, you wouldn't -- the only thing the state court could do is tell the state agency to rule.\n\nIt couldn't enter the other remedies that -- that we're seeking in this case.\n\nMandamus is also a discretionary remedy, and so I just don't think it's an effective substitute for the 1983 claims we're asserting today.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nWhat if a state has a -- a regime under which the -- the -- the person seeking the benefits first has to file the claim and then there -- there's a -- there are two levels of -- of appellate review, administrative review, and after -- I assume that you would admit that if the case were filed in federal court, the -- the person would have to seek the benefits in the first instance, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nYes.\n\nThey wouldn't have to -- it wouldn't be an exhaustion problem under Patsy.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nNo.\n\nOkay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nThey'd have to seek the benefits because there's no violation if you haven't tried the benefits.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nAll right.\n\nAnd then the -- then the -- the person says, oh, this process is too long, I -- I want a quick decision, they denied my claim.\n\nThen what?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nSo --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nIt's a violation of my due process rights because this is more elaborate than it needs to be.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nSo, if your claim was denied --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nRight.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\n-- you can go to federal court and you can file your claim and you can say there was a due process violation, and the court would adjudicate that.\n\nIf you jumped the gun and didn't wait for all the process to wrap up, then probably the federal court would say that there's no due process problem.\n\nThe state's given you plenty of process.\n\nAnd we'd want the state court to reach the same ruling.\n\nAnd if that's not the case, if you were collaterally attacking the state court administrative process and you finished it and there was still a due process violation, then maybe you'd win in federal court.\n\nAnd if you'd win in federal court, you should win in state court too.\n\nWe're just asking to align the rules.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, I -- you say this is not a neutral rule because, in every other case where there's a due process violation of an agent -- of an agency's process in some way, people can go directly to state court, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nThat -- that's one reason it's not neutral.\n\nAnother reason is Felder's reason, which is that it only applies to plaintiffs who sue the government.\n\nJudge:\nPlaintiffs who sue the government but for this particular type of benefit?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer:\nRight.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And we think that we are drawing the same type of distinction in our law between using one drug for -- for different purposes.\n\nJudgeOkay.\n\nMy legal question is I wondered if you had a response -- you know, I was asking your friends on the other side about de jure discrimination and what we should take account of if we're thinking about whether transgender people should be a suspect class for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nDo you have a response to that, what we should be thinking about or whether -- do you know the history of de jure discrimination?\n\nLawyer of DefendantI do not know the history of de jure -- de jure discrimination.\n\nOur front-line position is that the Court has gotten out of the business of creating new quasi-suspect classes precisely because it's a very unprincipled test when it comes to creating these classes.\n\nIn -- in some of the cases, political powerless -- powerlessness means that you need project -- protection from the majoritarian process; in other cases, it means can you gain the attention of lawmakers in the most recent Cleburne test.\n\nSo the Court has not applied any form of principled analysis when it comes to creating these tests.\n\nIt's been an exercise of judicial power.\n\nAnd in the intermediate scrutiny analysis that accompanies the quasi-suspect class, classification is no more principled, and -- and the Court has often struggled to apply that as well.\n\nSo we don't think the Court should -- should even open the door for further judicial creation of new quasi-suspect classes.\n\nJudgeOkay.\n\nAnd -- and last legal question.\n\nI was just going to ask you one.\n\nI have a second one.\n\nCould you address Justice Kavanaugh's questions about what the implications of this case would be for the athletic context or the bathrooms context?\n\nLawyer of DefendantI would love to, Your Honor.\n\nSo we think this is -- we differ with our friends on the other side with respect to -- their argument is that, well, there's a sex-based classification and sex separates sports, so, necessarily, that means that -- that we're -- there's a sex classification and intermediate scrutiny applies.\n\nWe are not actually seeing challenges to the sex classification.\n\nWhen these challenges are being brought, they're not arguing that we don't want there to be boys and girls sports.\n\nThey're arguing we want there to be boys and girls sports.\n\nWe just want to be -- we just want to be classified based off of our gender identity.\n\nAnd so we think that is -- that is a -- fundamentally a transgender-based challenge and not a sex-based challenge if you are not actually challenging the sex classification that is at issue.\n\nJudgeCan I ask you, so in -- in my sort of Loving parallel, Virginia in your view would not have been making a racial classification if they had just reworded their statute to say no person can get a license to marry for the purpose of uniting with another person whose race is inconsistent with their own.\n\nI took you to say that the use of the term \"inconsistent with their sex\" was drawing a line to prohibit one use of the medication.\n\nLawyer of DefendantYeah.\n\nJudgeSo why couldn't these statutes have been interpreted as drawing a line to prohibit one use of a marriage license?\n\nLawyer of DefendantYour Honor, we think that in a case like Loving, when you look at the individual level, which we agree with our friends on the other side that the protection of the Equal Protection Clause operates at the individual level, that if there is a line that is being drawn based off of race, like in Loving, where you had a white male who could not -- who could not marry an African American female under that law, that is a race-based line.\n\nYou are creating multiple groups of permissible and impermissible behavior based off of race.\n\nWhere we differ from -- from our friends on the other side is we just don't think that there is any sex-based line in this -- in this statute.\n\nJudgeBut I don't understand why not.\n\nI mean, these law -- the law here operates in the same way.\n\nThere -- there, the question of can you marry this other person depended upon what your race was.\n\nYou could marry the other person if it was the same, consistent with your race.\n\nYou couldn't if you couldn't.\n\nI -- I take your law to be doing basically the same thing.\n\nYou can get these blockers if doing so is consistent with your sex but not if it's inconsistent.\n\nSo how are they different?\n\nLawyer of DefendantWe think it's different because we think, in their use of \"inconsistent with sex\" in all of these examples that they have in the briefing, those actually do create separate categories of conduct that is permissible either based on sex or based on race.\n\nBut, in this case, the only way that they can point to a sex-based line is to equate fundamentally different medical treatments.\n\nGiving -- giving testosterone to a boy with a deficiency is not the same treatment as giving it to a girl who has psychological distress associated with her body.\n\nThese are -- this is -- this is not only different --\n\nJudgeAnd what's your basis for saying that?

And that transfer is voidable because it was done unlawfully, fraudulently.\n\nAnd when Congress wants to identify the --the transferee and make a difference there, it does so.\n\nFor example, it protects good-faith purchasers in some other statutes. Have I got the gist of the dispute accurately there?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's correct. And, Judge, what's critical to understand is the government's view is that the trustee illegally went after the insiders because they too would be able to assert sovereign immunity.\n\nTheir view is the trustee, because this went to the United States, it will always block any transfer because the United States, there's no way to ever get at this money.\n\nJudge:\nMs. Blatt, am I --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo a trustee, if it ever goes to the IRS, which has over 10 years to seek --10 years, which is a lot longer than the four-year statute of limitations to go after tax liability and is a lot more capable than I would say the bus -- the bus drivers and the workers who work for this estate, the trustee is not here for his personal benefit --\n\nJudge:\nMs.\n\n--Ms. Blatt, may I ask --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- but to get money to people who need it.\n\nJudge:\n-- can I ask you a follow-up to the question? How is it --so I -- I -- I get that the statute doesn't mention the transferee, but how is -- does that make 544(b) different from 544(a)? Because isn't the suit you're asserting somewhat hypothetical rather than actual if you're just imagining the claim existing kind of in the ether?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes.\n\nSo the actual -- because that's the -- the creditor, there has to be an actual creditor, but it doesn't matter that --who the transferee was.

{"id": "37", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, I mean, that's in part because the facilities closed down and you -- the material is left where the facility used to be.\r\n\r\nBut is there any comparator for a large amount -- I forget how many metric tons we're talking about here -- is transported to a separate private facility for virtually permanent storage?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I guess the -- the GE Morris facility has been in -- is a standalone facility that's been in operation since, you know, I think around 1980 or before. So I -- I don't think the volumes are the same as the ones that ISP contemplates.\r\n\r\nBut the -- the two things I would say are, first, the -- the volume of waste is not going to -- in the United States, is not going to change depending on whether licenses like these are granted.\r\n\r\nGranting license to possess the spent nuclear fuel in a storage facility is not going to increase the volume of nuclear waste.\r\n\r\nIt's just going to change where in the country it would be stored.\r\n\r\nAnd with respect to permanence versus temporary status, the -- there's no reason to think that if the Court rules against us and the waste has to stay at the site of the decommissioned reactors, it will stay there for any shorter period of time.\r\n\r\nIt's still going to stay somewhere until a permanent repository is opened up.\r\n\r\nAnd the third thing -- and this goes to the point I was making before about market-based solutions and ISP's motivation -- part of the suboptimal character of continued storage at the decommissioned sites is that you have a bunch of places around the country that now serve no other purpose but to store spent nuclear fuel when once they were operating reactors.\r\n\r\nAnd, clearly, ISP and some of its potential contracting parties think that it would be better to centralize the fuel at one location so that the other locations could be returned to what's been referred to as greenfield status.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They can be put to alternative uses.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you. Justice Alito?\r\n\r\nJudge: Is there more -- excuse me. Is there more security around facilities that are owned by the federal government than around these private facilities?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I -- I don't know the answer to that.\r\n\r\nI mean, certainly, the Commission, in determining whether the -- the licensee has met the requirements, wants to be -- wants to verify that there will be what the Commission views as adequate security arrangements.\r\n\r\nJudge: Suppose this is allowed and 40 years go by, and then there's an application to renew the license.\r\n\r\nWould it be permanent at that time, or what if it's renewed and it's another 40 years?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would still not --\r\n\r\nJudge: It will never become permanent?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would still not be permanent.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, you would have the same dilemma if the waste is left at the decommissioned nuclear reactor sites.\r\n\r\nThat is, at some point, the storage -- the -- the materials license will expire.\r\n\r\nThe Commission will have to decide whether a new license should be issued.\r\n\r\nWe're going to confront that -- until a repository is made available, we're going to confront that dilemma at some locations within the country.\r\n\r\nIt's just a question of where those locations will be.\r\n\r\nAnd the other point I would make about security at federal versus private, the -- the decommissioned reactor sites I'm referring to are also private sites.\r\n\r\nThey -- they would be governed by the same arrangements that would govern ISP.\r\n\r\nJudge: Which statutory provision -- I know you cite a number of them. Which one do you think provides the strongest support for your argument?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I think -- I would say two things.\r\n\r\nThe first -- first, I would point the Court to the licensing procedure -- provisions in the Atomic Energy Act, which are 42 U.S.C. 2073(a), which deals with special nuclear material; 2093, which deals with source material; and 2111, which deals with by-product material.\r\n\r\nAnd the Commission, from 1980, has regarded those -- has had published regulations that treat those as authority to license private storage of spent nuclear fuel.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I would point the Court to in the Policy Act is that the Policy Act was enacted in 1982, two years after the Commission's rules had been promulgated. Congress clearly expressed its approval of private storage, focusing on onsite storage, but it didn't create new licensing mechanisms for that to occur.\r\n\r\nAnd so --\r\n\r\nJudge: And -- thank you, Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\nOne other -- one final question. 2073(a) refers to special nuclear material, not to spent nuclear waste, and special nuclear material has a -- a specific narrow definition.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes, and there is also a provision -- I think it's 22-0 -- 01(h) -- that says various authorizations can be combined in a single license.\r\n\r\nAnd the -- the -- the three constituent parts of spent nuclear fuel that require a license are special nuclear material, source material, and by-product material.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Commission has always believed that a license that covers each of those will be sufficient to cover spent nuclear fuel because there's nothing else that needs to be licensed.\r\n\r\nAnd then the other point I would make is, if that were not true, the Commission would be equally unable to license onsite storage because these are the same provisions it relies on to license storage at the site of a nuclear reactor.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\r\n\r\nJudge: Counsel, these -- the onsite storage requires security to watch this product -- inert product and make sure that nobody breaks in.\r\n\r\nSo what we're talking about is that there is a danger to the community by these inactive facilities holding on to the spent nuclear waste because the degree of store -- the -- the cost associated with the storage in terms of security is greater, isn't it?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd that was one of the justifications that ISP gave, that it was -- it was more economical to have security for one centralized facility than to have separate security for different facilities around the country.\r\n\r\nJudge: 2201 basically authorizes the agency \"to establish by rule, regulation, or order such standards and instructions to govern the possession and use of special nuclear material, including all the by-product materials, as the Commission may deem necessary or desirable to promote the common defense and security or to protect health or to minimize danger to life or property.\"\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Commission did --\r\n\r\nJudge: I look at that as the direct authorization to set forth the terms of possession and license, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd I -- I think the Commission was on solid ground when it promulgated the rules in 1980, but when Congress stepped in two years later and enacted some new provisions but without disturbing the preexisting licensing scheme, that was an effective ratification.\r\n\r\n\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "806", "dialogue": "Judge: Yeah, that's what you want to say. Give me one example, because your police officers couldn't, and they explicitly said, if someone has another home, has a home, and is out there and happens to fall asleep, they won't be arrested. Fall asleep with something on them.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, Joint Appendix page 98 is one example of a citation issued to a person with a home address. But, more importantly, I think what we're getting at here is that these laws regulate conduct of everyone. There's nothing in the law that criminalizes homelessness. I really want to --\n\nJudge: That's what -- that's what you say, but if I look at the record and see differently, it's a different argument, isn't it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Grants Pass policy actually very clearly says that being homeless is not a crime. And that's in --\n\nJudge: Well, I know that's what you say, but if you're enforcing it only against the homeless, I will suggest that you look -- there's one brief -- let me see if I can find it -- that talks about this. At any rate, I'll find it later and just mention it.\n\nThe second thing I want to ask you is, you seemed to start by saying that the Eighth Amendment is limited to forms of punishment and not to the nature of punishment, the proportionality issue.\n\nThere also is a number of amicus briefs that lay out for us that from the Magna Carta through the founding, through state laws, through Weems, which was in 1910, through Trop later in the century, that throughout all of that, both the English, American colonies, this Court has had some form of proportionality in their Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\nYou're asking us to ignore all of that history.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we're not, Your Honor. What we are saying is that this case doesn't implicate proportionality. We're not asking the Court to take a position on whether it's a proper inquiry under the Eighth Amendment. For example --\n\nJudge: Oh, yes, yes, you are, because you're saying that the only thing that's prohibited by the Eighth Amendment is the form of punishment, but, in those cases and in our history, we have said that certain punishments, Trop, for example, can't be done.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's right. And the Court has always looked at if a particular punishment is considered too extreme or categorically so, as in the death penalty in some cases, the Court looks at whether a lesser punishment would be acceptable. Again, it's looking at punishment. And that's where the inquiry focuses.\n\nHere, only what -- what the Respondents are asking this Court to do is to extend Robinson beyond --\n\nJudge: Do you have hotels that are valued at 200, $250 in your city?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I --\n\nJudge: Just answer yes or no.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don't -- I don't know.\n\nJudge: Well, let's assume because, even in New York City, which may be the most expensive city in the nation or close to it, there are hotels that are less than that or at that price. If a homeless person had that kind of money, don't you think they'd stay in a hotel?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, Your Honor, the -- the difficulty here is that this rule that the Respondents are proposing rests on whether someone's conduct is involuntary. Most importantly here, we're talking about conduct, so I want to talk about how this is completely distinguishable from Robinson. The point --\n\nJudge: So can I talk about that? So taking Robinson as a given, could you criminalize the status of homelessness?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I have a couple points to that.\n\nJudge: It's just a simple question.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So Robinson doesn't address that, and I think it's completely distinguishable.\n\nJudge: Could you criminalize the status of homelessness?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I don't think that homelessness is a status like drug addiction, and Robinson only stands for that.\n\nJudge: Well, homelessness is a status. It's the status of not having a home.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I actually -- I disagree with that, Your Honor, because it is so fluid, it's so different. People experiencing homelessness might be one day without shelter, the next day with. The federal definition contemplates various forms.\n\nJudge: In the period where you don't have a home and you are homeless, is that a status?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: Could you criminalize that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, it's not.\n\nJudge: So you couldn't just --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Robinson talked about --\n\nJudge: -- you -- you -- you could criminalize just homelessness?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I want to say, first, a couple of things. So I think that for the -- the --\n\nJudge: I mean, that's quite striking --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, I don't.\n\nJudge: -- that you think that you can criminalize just homelessness.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we're not saying that homelessness is a status, but, most importantly, I think the Eighth Amendment --\n\nJudge: Well, you're not saying --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- is the wrong way to focus on this question.\n\nJudge: It's really a simple question. Can you criminalize homelessness? And you're suggesting, yes, you could.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, we do not criminalize homelessness. I'm not saying --\n\nJudge: Could you criminalize homelessness? Not tell me what you do do, what you don't do. Could you?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think there would be due process problems and vagueness problems. I don't think there's an Eighth Amendment problem in the sense of Robinson because that was a limited decision where the holding was solely about a disease of addiction.

{"id": "752", "dialogue": "Judge: Why is it correct? In other words, it does seem, as the Plaintiff's Lawyer's questions indicate, that the Rockwell above the line and the Rockwell footnote, you would think, would come out the same way under the text of the statute.\n\nSo I guess, assuming the above-the-line part is correct, why does the text of the statute support Footnote 6?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So I think the text of the statute supports the removal jurisdiction in this case, not what happened in Rockwell.\n\nSo I -- I actually --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nSo the -- I think your answer is the part of Rockwell that's not in the footnote is -- is shaky.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's correct.\n\nAnd that's what the Chamber of Commerce --\n\nJudge: The part in the footnote, you think that's solid.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think that's solid because the text of Section 1367 says there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\n\nSection (c)(3) makes clear that you don't have to have a federal question throughout the proceedings in order for there to continue to be supplemental jurisdiction; (c)(2) expressly addresses situations like this one, where the federal law claims have fallen out.\n\nIn that situation, the state law claims would substantially predominate.\n\nJudge: I think they're going to probably say something also like it was stray comments that weren't carefully considered.\n\nAnd I -- do you want to respond to the -- I'm just previewing what they're likely to say.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: One thing I would -- I do want to emphasize here is this Court was thinking about this question in Cohill.\n\nIf you go to the oral argument in Cohill -- right around minute 5, the Judge was asking the same questions that we're talking about today.\n\nSo the Court wasn't somehow unaware of this question.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nHe seemed to be articulating the position in the oral argument, as I read it, that the Plaintiff ultimately came to in the Eighth Circuit, but, obviously, by the time of Rockwell, the Judge had not stuck with that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think that's right, and I think it is important that this Court was aware of the question, continued to apply its precedents, longstanding precedent in Cohill.\n\nAnd I don't think you can write Cohill, which is all about this is a doctrine of discretion.\n\nI don't think you can write Cohill if you think that the court didn't have jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: So can we go back to --\n\nJudge: Suppose a diversity case -- I have a diversity case, I file it in state court, it's removed to federal court, and once I'm in federal court, I join a non-diverse party.\n\nCan the federal -- can the federal court hold onto that case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, no, Your Honor, and that is addressed specifically in 1367(b). So there are circumstances, you know, for example, where there's a third-party defendant or a dispensable plaintiff under Rule 20 that, you know, the court may be able to because it's not addressed in Section --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nWell, why should there be a different rule regarding parties and claims?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So Congress thought very hard about this.\n\nThis Court has long held -- had two different lines of precedent, one for pendent-claim jurisdiction and one for pendent-party jurisdiction.\n\nIt has taken a very broad view to pendent-claim jurisdiction and very narrow view to pendent-party jurisdiction. And Congress said that's not what we want.\n\nWe don't want Finley.\n\nWe do want some limits.\n\nI think (b) tells you that (a) is so broadly written that if you don't have (b), that there would be concerns about diversity jurisdiction questions, Your Honor.\n\nBut Congress thought very carefully about this, and it -- it made clear that there would continue to be supplemental jurisdiction even when the federal claims dropped out of the case.\n\nJudge: If we thought that the Eighth Circuit's decision is right as a matter of first principle, what relevance, if any, would this line of court of appeals decisions have in our decision-making?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think it's very important here because Congress is codifying precedent.\n\nIt's codifying these court of appeals decisions in particular in (c)(1).\n\nIt's very much aware of them.\n\nAnd the court of appeals decisions are reflecting this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury and Cohill and -- and now Rockwell.\n\nThis is incredibly well established. So I don't think the Court should ignore that that's what the court of appeals have been doing and that they're doing it for a reason, because this is a doctrine of discretion.\n\nIt's a matter for the district court to say, what are the fairness concerns? What are the comity concerns? What are the judicial efficiency concerns? Maybe the district court can dispose of the state law questions really easily and the case has been going on for two years in the district court.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to send that case back to state court.\n\nJudge: Well, this goes back to a question that was asked earlier. Usually, when we apply this old soil rule, we're talking about a term of art in the statute about which there was a body of preexisting precedent.\n\nWhat term of art can you point to here that supports your argument?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\n\nSo, if you look at (c), the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, that language comes directly from Cohill.\n\nIt's not in Gibbs.\n\nThat's the language the Court uses twice.\n\nAnd so, when you're thinking about what did Congress intend to codify when it comes to whether the district court can exercise discretion, I think you have to take into account what this Court held in Cohill.\n\nI also think, Your Honor, if you think that the text doesn't say anything, this Court has held that statutory silence implies ratification by Congress.\n\nI think you can apply that doctrine as well to reach the answer here.\n\nJudge: I think, if you think that the text doesn't say anything, you're left with trying to figure out what rule to use in this instance that best coheres with the whole panoply of rules that we use in other contexts.\n\nAnd I think that on that account, you have a tough road to hoe.\n\nYou have -- you have St. Paul, and that's the amount in controversy. But, for the reasons that were discussed earlier, the amount in controversy requirement has generally been thought of as sui generis because of the difficulty of figuring out when, how you're supposed to measure that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: May I respond, Your Honor?\n\nJudge: Certainly.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So I think it's very important here that this is a longstanding rule that really reflects the idea that Congress wanted district courts to make the decision. They wanted district courts to decide, is there gamesmanship going on here? Is there judicial efficiency concerns? Are there comity concerns?\n\nAnd this rule that this Court is talking about would need to apply to all sorts of different circumstances, such as when the claims become moot, when the parties settle the claim, when the plaintiff amends the complaint. And when Congress drafted Section 1367(c), what it wanted was to give district courts discretion, and that's a reflection of decades and decades of precedent, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Thank you, counsel.\n\nJust a brief question.\n\nYou complain about the forum manipulation problems this would create.\n\nI don't see how that's a problem here. They wanted -- they start in state court; they want to go back to state court.\n\nThey're not trying to manipulate anything.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "963", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: Yes. The -- the fact remains, if the Court's going to depart from the otherwise controlling definition, it looks to something else in the statute that provides a countervailing argument.\n\nFor example, Utility Air was brought up. The Court looked to provisions of the statute that said, if we apply the definition of \"air pollutant\" to these provisions, we have an unworkable statute.\n\nAnd to the extent you conclude that \"person\" doesn't apply to 1681q because that's unworkable or improbable that Congress intended to extend criminal liability this far, that is a -- that is an argument, an interpretation that would be limited to 1681q.\n\nJudge: Well, you say in the statute, but I guess the argument is that there can be limitations outside the statute that would apply as well.\n\nAnd I'm thinking in particular of our decision in the Bond case, the -- the -- the chemical on the doorknob that is under one interpretation, perhaps literal interpretation of the statute would be covered by the Chemical Weapons Treaty. And we said that sometimes arguments like, well, that seems pretty implausible can trump what would otherwise be a pretty precise reading of the statutory language.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, that's right. I think Bond -- Bond is a good foil for this case. The Court found -- your opinion for the Court found that the statute was ambiguous. And, I mean, I agree that if this statute is ambiguous, then the -- the sovereign immunity canon favors the government.\n\nBut if -- but the -- the -- there, the definition the Court called improbably broad, there's nothing improbably broad about defining \"person\" to include the government. The Court has said, if Congress wants to not have the ordinary meaning of \"person\" applied --\n\nJudge: Well, I -- I would have thought -- sorry to interrupt, but I -- I would have thought it's -- the improbability comes from the argument that this would mean you can prosecute the United States, it can mean that you can get damages from the United States and so on and so forth.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, even if prosecuting the United States is improbable, seeking damages from the United States is not improbable. Congress waived sovereign immunity in a number of statutes.\n\nJudge: Well, it's pretty improbable for the statute to authorize the FTC to seek damages from the United States, which is what it does.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, I think, does the same thing. It set up the same sort of enforcement mechanism. There are other -- there are other statutory schemes that authorize intergovernmental liability, our Resource Conservation Recovery Act --\n\nJudge: You -- keep going.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. I -- I --\n\nJudge: Okay. You -- you said at the beginning and I think just now that Congress knew what it was doing when it amended the Act. But I don't think it realized that it was imposing this liability. If you look at the CBO, Congressional Budget Office, reports, there's no mention of anything, any liability like this.\n\nAnd they carefully analyze how much the additional costs would be for the executive branch in enforcement and the judicial branch in handling the additional cases. So -- and the CBO score, as you know and anyone familiar with that process knows, is very important for Congress. So I -- I don't think it's right to say Congress knew what it was doing.\n\nYou may -- could still win without that, but I think that's not -- not correct, unless you want to respond to that in some way.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well -- well, I don't think the CBO is itself Congress. And Congress --\n\nJudge: Correct.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I mean, what -- what is --\n\nJudge: But they do -- do you challenge that Congress relies on the CBO score when it's doing legislation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, it's -- it's -- it's part --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- of the committee reports.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I think you have to acknowledge that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I accept the proposition that the legislative history doesn't say one thing or another about sovereign immunity.\n\nThe -- the -- the legislative history does talk about the purpose of the statute, and that is consistent with a conclusion that Congress wanted to hold the government liable just as any private furnisher of information would be for -- for failing to comply with their FCRA duties.\n\nJudge: Can I -- can I also, on a different tack, another judge raised an important question, I thought, about federal versus state sovereign immunity, and you heard I -- I mentioned separation of powers.\n\nMy understanding was that the reason we have that is because taxpayer money is -- is valuable and we should be sure it's been appropriated before we funnel a bunch of money out of the Treasury. That's both to ensure that money can be spent on other programs because it's not limitless money in the Treasury, and it's to ensure otherwise that taxes aren't raised. So we have to be very careful before we overstep, as basic separation of powers.\n\nDo you dispute any of that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Not at all. You have two principles that are designed to protect that interest. One is the sovereign immunity canon.\n\nSo, if the -- a statute is ambiguous, the sovereign immunity canon would say even the government gets the benefit of ambiguities even if that's not the best reading of the statute.\n\nAnd the second one is the specificity requirement, so a broad statute cannot waive sovereign immunity. The -- the statute must discuss governmental entities specifically, which the definition here does.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I guess I'm a little confused why -- I mean, I can understand that you don't need to make the argument to prevail in your view, but I -- I'm not sure I understand your response to the previous judge from first principles.\n\nSovereign immunity serves many important purposes in respecting other institutions, states, tribes, foreign governments. It's inherent in our constitutional design, embodied in the Tenth Amendment even, for example.\n\nBut, when it comes -- if we're worried about protecting the federal fisc, I would have thought that the answer might be Congress is in the best position to do that. Article I gives them power over the federal fisc. And we have no license to expand or contract its instructions artificially but follow them instead faithfully.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I mean, that's right. At bottom, this is a policy choice for Congress to make.\n\nJudge: One would have thought.\n\nJudge: Why is there a clear statement rule then?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, just as with other policy choices, the Court -- if the -- the area is a particularly sensitive one, the Court wants --\n\nJudge: Why -- why -- why is it sensitive?\n\nJudge: What isn't sensitive?\n\nJudge: Why -- why is it sensitive? Focus on that if you could.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I -- I think the Court takes holding the government liable, especially for damages, seriously. So it wants -- doesn't want to construe ambiguous text in -- in a way that may be different than Congress understood ambiguous text. But, when the text is clear, that's a different matter altogether.\n\nWhen there's only one plausible interpretation of the text under traditional rules of statutory interpretation, the Court shouldn't be applying a different interpretation of the statute.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "944", "dialogue": "**Judge:** So that argument depends on the idea that the $3 million redemption obligation is a debt, a liability. And that's just not correct. What it is is a promise to cash out one of the existing shareholder's shares.  \n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** So, for example, in the two sisters hypothetical, on page 37 of our brief, if you own 80 percent of a company worth $5 million, you have a $4 million stake in the company. A redemption obligation at fair market value would be a promise to cash you out for your shares for your stake in the company. It is not the same thing as the corporation, for example, owing a mortgage or some other debt. A mortgage or some other debt like that would reduce the value of the company and the value for its shareholders. That is simply not true of a redemption obligation.\n\nAnd I think that it is important that the defendant concedes that a voluntary redemption obligation wouldn’t decrease the value of the company because, on the date of Michael’s death, it doesn’t matter whether the redemption obligation is voluntary or mandatory. The $3 million is being paid to Michael’s shares, so that’s where that money is going, whether that is voluntary or mandatory. The point is that this was part of the corporate assets here and was paid to Michael on the date of his death.\n\n**Judge:** Do you agree that none of the money escapes taxation because more value— I mean, the $3 million of the life insurance proceeds didn’t vanish, as you say it’s retained by the company, and the defendant was pointing out that Thomas will be taxed on that as a capital gains tax when he sells his shares. So the defendant says that means the government is double dipping. What do you have to say to that?\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** A couple of responses to that. First of all, any sort of double-dipping allegation comes from the Crown family’s decision to value the shares below fair market value. Had these shares been redeemed for fair market value, which is $5.3 million, there would be no risk of double taxation. The risk of double taxation comes because $2.3 million stayed in Crown and inured to Thomas’s benefit, but that money was part of the fair market value of Michael’s shares.\n\nIn a transaction that was done at fair market value, you would have had $5.3 million go to Michael’s estate, be subject to the estate tax, and never be subject to any possibility of future taxation through capital gains on Thomas. So that’s the first answer, which is that this problem arises because the estate valued these shares below fair market value.\n\nBut the second answer is that we simply can’t know what will happen to Thomas’s shares in the future. Maybe they will be subject to capital gains. It depends on whether he bequeaths them and what they are worth at that time. That’s a separate inquiry that goes to the value of Thomas’s shares. The estate tax cares about the shares of Michael’s estate at the time of his death, not what went to any of the particular heirs or beneficiaries.\n\n**Judge:** Am I wrong that, on capital gains, you pay the tax at the price you’ve gotten it?\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** If he gets a stepped-up—\n\n**Judge:** And that’s why he won’t pay on that.\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** If he sells it during his lifetime, he didn’t get these shares as a bequeathment, so he’s not entitled to a stepped-up basis. But he could pass it on to his heirs with a stepped-up basis.\n\n**Judge:** The net worth question—the defendant said the net worth stayed the same all the way through. Do you agree? If not, why is it not relevant?\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** It’s not true. The corporation was worth $6.86 million on the date of Michael’s death. Our view is not that only Michael’s shares had some value in them that the corporation didn’t have. Our view is that the corporation’s equity value is made up of the equity stakeholders’ value. Michael’s shares were entitled to a $5.3 million valuation, and Thomas’s shares were valued at $1.5 million. That adds up to our $6.86 million valuation.\n\n**Judge:** You said the redemption obligation is not a debt. Can you walk me through that? This case is extremely difficult, and that seems like a key point.\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** Sure. I would just start by saying that I think the defendant agrees that a voluntary redemption is not the payment of a debt.\n\n**Judge:** Yes.\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** So, to the extent that we are—\n\n**Judge:** But the defendant is saying that’s the key point in the case. I think that’s what was said. So I’d like to hear you address that.\n\n**Plaintiff's Lawyer:** Yes. I think that we’ve been talking about the amicus briefs, which are very helpful in explaining the nature of a redemption generally. A redemption is when a company agrees to exchange one of the existing shareholders’ shares—their stake in the company, their equity stake—for cash. That’s the promise. The company will get back the equity shares and will give the shareholder cash in exchange.\n\nIf that were done at fair market value, it would mean that if you had an 80 percent stake in a $5 million company, you would be entitled to $4 million in cash. What happens on the other side? Your shares are extinguished, so they no longer exist. The remaining shareholder, who had a 20 percent stake in a $5 million company (valued at $1 million), would now own sole ownership of a $1 million company.\n\nIn a redemption, if the redemption is done at fair market value, both corporate shareholders walk away with the same value they had before. By contrast, in a debt situation, paying a debt means the corporation pays money out of its coffers to someone outside the corporation. That reduces both the corporate and shareholder value. If this had been a $3 million debt, then the defendant’s analysis would be right. But here, the $3 million went into Michael’s pocket—it went to one of the equity shareholders. That does not decrease the value of the corporation or the value of the shares to be redeemed.\n\nJust to pause on that for a second: The defendant says that what’s being valued here is some theoretical stake in the corporation, not Michael’s shares. That’s not correct as a matter of the statute. The statute—26 U.S.C. 2031, 2033, and 2036—tells us that the relevant shares to be valued here are the decedent’s shares. That’s what we’re valuing. But even if we were to value some hypothetical 77 percent stake in the company, with a redemption obligation or anything like that, we would always get $5.3 million because that’s what that stake is worth.\n\nThe only way the defendant arrives at different numbers is by treating the $3 million as a separate debt that must first be deducted from the company before valuing Michael’s shares. But that approach doesn’t make sense because the $3 million is going to the holder of Michael’s shares—it is not some free-floating debt in the universe.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "975", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 23-1095, Thompson versus United States.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1014 punishes only false statements, not true but misleading ones, and we know that from the text, the context in the statutory code, and this Court's precedents.\n\nAt the outset, at its most basic, the word \"false\" means not true.\n\nIt is, therefore, implausible to suggest that the statute that punishes false statements includes some types of true statement. \"False\" and \"true but misleading\" are different concepts.\n\nWhen Congress means to prohibit both, it does so explicitly using both terms, as it has in over 100 places in the United States Code.\n\nThe government would put this all down to serial, thoughtless redundancy, but that violates the first principle of statutory interpretation: to heed the text.\n\nThe courts below erroneously held that Section 1014 punishes misleading statements in addition to false ones.\n\nWe are asking the Court to correct that legal error and to remand to the courts below for a determination of whether Mr. Thompson's statements were false or only misleading.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: How would you define \"false\" and how would you define or distinguish -- and distinguish that from \"misleading?\"\n\nLawyer of Defendant: A false statement is one that is not true when compared to the objective facts. A misleading statement is a statement that depends on the reasonable hearer's understanding.\n\nThe term \"misleading\" is -- by its nature focuses on what the hearer hears.\n\nThe term \"false\" relates to an objective fact about the universe.\n\nJudge: Do you think there could be overlap between the two?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: There definitely are -- is overlap, Your Honor.\n\nMany, many false statements are misleading, and many misleading statements are false.\n\nBut that does not mean they're synonyms. As this Court has recognized on a number of occasions, including in the Macquarie case, where the Court dealt with Rule 10b-5 and held that 10b-5's two parts, the first penalized only express false statements and the second half-truths, which it referred to as misleading omissions.\n\nJudge: Often, we see \"false\" and \"misleading\" paired, and you think of it -- there's a tendency to think of those two paired, false and misleading or false or misleading.\n\nWhy wouldn't we do that here as opposed to just taking a literal view of false?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, when we see them in these hundred-plus statutes, it's always in the disjunctive, false or misleading, suggesting that those are two different things.\n\nAnd they do have different meanings because \"false\" is an objective question.\n\nIf I -- if I say the sun rises in the west, that is a false statement, and it doesn't matter what the perception of the listener is.\n\nSo I think that there is a good statutory context argument, a very good statutory context argument, for suggesting, when Congress says \"false,\" it means false, not misleading. Otherwise, there would be a hundred statutes, from the Commodities Exchange Act to the Securities Exchange Act, to a number of labeling statutes, down to the Peanut Statistics Act and the act that penalizes false or misleading statements by an officer of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Court to either make false or misleading statements.\n\nCongress chose not to do that here.\n\nJudge: I take it you are not arguing that the statute requires that the statement be literally false when viewed in isolation?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nJudge: Is that correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Is that correct? Is that your --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That -- that --that is correct.\n\nJudge: -- that is your argument?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That -- that is not our argument.\n\nAs this Court said in Bronston, and I would point the Court to Footnote 3, the context that's relevant is the question that's asked, not the other circumstances.\n\nBut, obviously, it would be absurd to try and judge a statement in isolation from the question that it answers.\n\nJudge: So can I just ask you --\n\nJudge: I -- I don't --\n\nJudge: Oh.\n\nJudge: Sorry.\n\nJudge: -- even if we accept or agree with you that the statute covers only false statements, based on what you've said you believe a false statement is, I guess I don't understand how that helps your client in this case, because the amount of money that he borrowed or that he owed, I would think, is a knowable fact with one correct answer and that it doesn't rely on any sort of perception of the hearer or whatnot, however you've defined \"misleading.\" So why -- why would we send this back for --for the lower court to --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, I'd point out at the outset --\n\nJudge: -- assess?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'd point out at the outset, Your Honor, that neither of the lower courts applied this standard to the facts of the case, and so this Court would be doing it for the first time.\n\nBut the statements that were made here, the prosecutor explicitly told the lower court -- and this is Joint Appendix 144 -- what Mr. Thompson said was literally true, but it was not the whole truth.\n\nMr. Thompson was never asked how much did you borrow and -- and did not, therefore, respond, I only borrowed $110,000.\n\nJudge: My understanding was that he wasn't asked anything.\n\nHe was sent an invoice after the bank closed, and the invoice listed the various loans that he had made and the amount of interest that, according to the statement, he owed in total.\n\nAnd so I don't understand why that's not tantamount -- his response, his, apparently, three times going back and saying, no, I owe $110,000, why is that not a false statement in that context?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: The -- the invoice didn't have the details.\n\nIt said the unpaid principal balance was $269,000.\n\nSo, if we take that as an implicit question, do you owe $269,000, his statement was: I borrowed $110,000; I had a promissory note for $110,000.\n\nThat statement, \"I borrowed $110,000 on a $110,000 promissory note,\" is absolutely true.

At that point, the CFPB—\n\nJudge: No, I'm talking about the Appropriations Clause.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think that, you know, Congress itself has specified the purpose. And so I think that if the President or the CFPB director didn't comply with the statute, that would be a violation, and I would expect Congress to step in and change the funding mechanism.

{"id": "617", "dialogue": "Judge: I want to articulate your rule. And you're right, it's different. But you keep saying it's a Fifth Circuit rule. I'm not sure it's the Fifth Circuit rule because the Fifth Circuit has criticized evidence with respect to what the drug cartel's knowledge is. So I think you're breaking from the Fifth Circuit, as the plaintiff's side breaks from the Ninth Circuit.\n\nJudge: Everybody's trying to find that happy medium. But the Rules of Evidence don't say, even if you can get something in a different way, your mistake is—you can do it this particular way all the time.\n\nJudge: You know, I'm thinking about—we have a lot of hearsay that you can't get in under hearsay, but you can get it in for other reasons that don't go to the ultimate guilt of people. Rules are rules, and there's a reason for them.\n\nJudge: And I think what you're arguing is this rule says you can talk about modus operandi of drug traffickers generally, but you can't talk about a particular defendant or class of defendants and what their mental state is because that's what the rule tells you you can't do.\n\nJudge: So it might feel like an exercise without a point, but it is an important point. Isn't that what you're trying to say?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right. I think we are defending pretty much what happens in the Fifth Circuit. And the reason why that's the rule is because of the importance of mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's—as the court itself has highlighted in cases in recent years, it is the heart of our criminal law, and it's the heart of a jury's function to make that moralistic qualitative determination.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, if it seems formalistic when I say you're drawing a line, a protective barrier around mens rea, it's because that's what the right of jury trial is about and that's what the drafters of this rule recognized.\n\nJudge: Has the federal government had any trouble convicting drug traffickers in the Fifth Circuit?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Not to my knowledge. And, of course, the plaintiff's side has had 20 years to bring this issue up if it didn't like the Fifth Circuit law.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think it works pretty well in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But let me say something that would lead—if you agreed with the plaintiff's concession now that saying people in this position always have the requisite mens rea, you're going to have to draw some very difficult lines.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: What if the expert testified and said people like this virtually always, 99 percent of the time?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: What if the expert said maybe it's hypothetically possible a defendant—take the 83 out of 83, and the expert said maybe, maybe it's possible somebody could not have known, but I've never seen such a case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You know, would that count? What if the expert said, like in this case, there's only three situations I can—I'm aware of where an expert—I'm sorry—where the defendant doesn't have the mens rea, and those three situations are all different from this case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And then take it one step further in closing argument when defense counsel tried to argue, well, Agent Flood admitted there are a few situations where defendants don't have the mens rea. The plaintiff objected and said, well, you can't argue that other situations might be possible because, here, you named three.\n\nJudge: But those all sound to me like cases in which Rule 403 might well come into play.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, remember, what the Ninth Circuit says about Rule 403 and Rule 401 is that this testimony goes to the heart of a blind mule defense, like in this case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So it's the exact opposite of being irrelevant or unduly prejudicial.\n\nJudge: Well, it's relevant, but it has a highly prejudicial value, and maybe it would be excluded by a lot of trial judges.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think—the plaintiff's position is in line with the Ninth Circuit, and we concede there's force to it, that this evidence is damaging because it's so directly relevant to the defendant's mens rea. That's the problem with it.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Justice, anything further?\n\nJudge: Justice, I—Justice is inviting, I think, even more chaos among courts.\n\nJudge: If you're going to rely on 403 or 702 or any individualized decision-making by judges, you're just throwing this up into the air with no clarity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right, Judge.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: One way to think about this is you have Rule 403, which is maybe the broadest, most flexible of the Rules of Evidence to deal with prejudicial evidence.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You have the next narrower rule, which is Rule 702, which is just about expert evidence and reliable bases for that evidence.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And then you have the narrowest of them all, Rule 704(b).\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm only asking you today to rule—to apply Rule 704(b), which is—\n\nJudge: I mean, once you're asking courts to go into asking every police officer how many of these cases have you had, when am I going to decide that 10 cases are not adequate, but 83 might be?\n\nJudge: When there are 550,000 drug arrests, is 83 enough? I don't know the statistical answer to that.\n\nJudge: Your rule is much simpler, isn't it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it—\n\nJudge: It's—if you're going to talk about a defendant and what a defendant is thinking, that's off limits. If you're talking about modus operandi of what others do or don't do, that's okay?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So my rule has two components. One is, is it about mens rea? Unquestionably yes here because the expert used the word \"know.\" And is it about the defendant?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And our rule there is very simple as well—directly about the defendant or a class of people including her.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's the full scope of that.\n\nJudge: And what is permissible, as you said, is if an expert says drug traffickers prefer to hire people that the traffickers know and trust rather than hide the drugs in a stranger’s car.\n\nJudge: Or drug traffickers want to know where the car goes, so they're going to use a GPS or something like that.\n\nJudge: That's modus operandi.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Descriptive modus operandi evidence that does not speak to mens rea directly is perfectly fine.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And let me add one thing to what you were talking about because I think it goes back to the Chief Judge’s question about cross-examination and maybe another Judge’s question about Rule 702 as well.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If the expert testified either on direct or cross, look, this is my experience across most cases, but I can't tell you anything about this particular defendant because I don't know anything about this defendant—whether or not she had the mens rea—then you would have a real objection under relevance or Rule 702.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Of course, you had nothing like that in this case, you know, so the plain implication to the jury was not just most people like this have the mens rea, but I believe this defendant has the mens rea", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

{"id": "943", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument next in Case 23-146, Connelly versus United States.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: To ensure continuity in their operations, closely held corporations will often agree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon his death and then obtain a life insurance policy on the shareholder in order to fund the redemption obligation.\n\nThis case presents the question of how the federal estate tax treats such arrangements. Because the proceeds from a life insurance policy to fulfill a contractual redemption obligation do not increase the corporation's net worth, they do not increase the estate tax owed on the decedent's stock. The court of appeals' contrary conclusion was erroneous.\n\nThe legal framework governing this case is relatively straightforward. The Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations provide that where the parties agree on the price to redeem a shareholder's stock, that price will establish the value of the stock for purposes of the estate tax in certain circumstances.\n\nBut where, as here, those circumstances have not been met, the value of the stock is determined by the price at which such stock would change hands between a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.\n\nHere, a hypothetical buyer would not treat the life insurance proceeds as increasing the value of the stock because that asset is offset by the contractual obligation to redeem shares, a preexisting corporate liability.\n\nNow the defendant argues that a court should attach no weight to the redemption obligation when assessing the value of the company. But the defendant fails to distinguish between a contractual obligation to redeem stock on the one hand and a voluntary stock redemption on the other.\n\nA hypothetical buyer would treat the contractual redemption obligation like any other debt that reduces the net worth and therefore the value of the company.\n\nThe defendant's approach would lead to a grossly inflated valuation of the decedent's shares, and it would effectively lead to double taxation. It would defy common sense to take one side of the transaction into account but to ignore the other for purposes of the estate tax.\n\nAnd it would destroy a valuable succession planning tool that the nation's small businesses have openly used for decades. The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, if a very interested buyer showed up the day after Michael died, would Thomas sell the business to him for 3.86 million?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, if Thomas were the person we were thinking about and not Michael, I think it is quite possible that a hypothetical willing buyer would pay $3.68 million—\n\nJudge: No, I'm more focused on the asking price. If a buyer showed up the day after Michael died and offered to buy it at any price, what would he sell it for?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think it's important here to distinguish between Michael and Thomas.\n\nJudge: Which one died?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Michael is the one who died.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And Michael, of course, is the one whose shares would be subject to the $3 million—\n\nJudge: But Thomas—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: —is actually in charge of the estate and the company, so he's on both, so he can actually sell the property, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, except for the fact that, under the buy-sell agreement, Thomas is actually disabled from selling the company.\n\nJudge: Well, he has the first option.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: He has the first option. That is correct. But, under the terms of the buy-sell agreement, the estate cannot sell the stock.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let's—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the way—\n\nJudge: Well, let me just blink that for a minute, okay? What would he ask for it, assuming he could sell it? Would he ask 3.86 million or 6.86 million, assuming that the insurance was included in the assets or liabilities of the company?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor. So the first question is what is the net worth of the company, because we're in agreement with the defendant that that is the first question.\n\nOur view is that the net worth of the company throughout all of this is $3.86 million. The defendant's view is that the net worth of the company is $6.86 million because, in their view, you take into account the life insurance proceeds but not the offsetting redemption obligation.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So, if you take the Arcadia, California, case, that was a case in which, at the summary judgment stage, some defendants were dismissed because there was not evidence that they were acting unlawfully.\n\nOthers were kept in because there was evidence that they were acting unlawfully.\n\nSo that might be the best example of the dichotomy you're talking about.\n\nJudge: Wouldn't you run into at some point a due process problem as far as the people you allege to have violated the Gun Control Act, who have not been charged with that by ATF and proven to have done that by the government?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No, I don't think you run into a due process problem precisely for the reason I think you pointed out a couple minutes ago, Justice Thomas.\n\nThere's no requirement of a conviction.\n\nAnd there are plenty of examples, including Williams versus Beemiller from New York, of instances where manufacturers have been alleged to have contribute -- to -- to have aided and abetted a violation by a dealer, and that case has been allowed to go forward.\n\nThere's not a due process issue that inheres in that.\n\nJudge: Justice Alito?\n\nJudge: There are some very interesting technical legal issues in this case: proximate cause, aiding and abetting, how much do you have to plead in a complaint.\n\nAnd you and Mr. Francisco have briefed and argued those very well.\n\nIt's very helpful to the Court.\n\nI just thought I would ask you a question that may be on the minds of ordinary Americans who hear this argument or learn about the case.\n\nMexico says that U.S. gun manufacturers are contributing to illegal conduct in Mexico.\n\nThere are Americans who think that Mexican government officials are contributing to a lot of illegal conduct here. So suppose that one of the 50 states sued the government of Mexico for aiding and abetting illegal conduct within the state's borders that causes the state to incur law enforcement costs, public welfare costs, other costs.\n\nWould your client be willing to litigate that case in the courts of the United States?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice Alito, I think we -- we would have to accessorize that hypothetical with what I assume are a lot of the things that are built into it, that there are no forum and venue questions and that the kinds of allegations are specific and talk about specific harms to the states.\n\nYou mentioned --\n\nJudge: Well, would your -- would your government say, whoa --your client say, whoa, sovereign immunity, you can't sue us on this?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Ah.\n\nWell, you know, if -- if the --\n\nJudge: Or would you will -- be willing to litigate all the doctrines that would apply if -- if the government of Mexico were not entitled to sovereign immunity?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, Justice Alito, under -- under Pfizer, of course, Mexico is entitled to come in -- and the Petitioners' own amici point this out --to come into this case just like any other litigant.\n\nThere are, of course, differences, if Mexico is brought in as a defendant.\n\nSo I can't and certainly, you know, don't -- don't feel comfortable giving away things like sovereign immunity on behalf of the government of Mexico.\n\nJudge: Well, I understand that.\n\nSo the -- the argument basically is it's a one-way street?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No, Justice Alito, I don't --\n\nJudge: The government of Mexico can sue U.S. manufacturers here for harm caused in Mexico, but one of the states here can't sue the government of Mexico for cause -- for harm caused in the United States?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't think it's entirely accurate to call it a one-way street. And if the street is one-way, it's because Pfizer and other decisions from this Court have said that when a sovereign comes into this Court as a plaintiff, it is treated exactly like any other plaintiff, no more, no less.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJudge: I just want to pick up briefly on questions Justice Thomas was asking.\n\nI mean, would your theory of aiding and abetting suggest that manufacturers should be concerned if their products, their lawful products, are sold in certain communities or certain neighborhoods where they're more likely to be misused? You know, we --we manufacture knives, but there are a lot of stabbings in certain neighborhoods.\n\nShould we -- should we make sure our products aren't sold there? Or a sporting goods company, and -- and baseball bats are used to, you know, storm CVSs or what have you, so we shouldn't sell in this city? Or prescription drugs are misused in a certain area, so we need to be alert and make sure? Is that where your theory of aiding and abetting leads, that you have to be kind of chasing --tracing everything down the chain and make sure we're not selling in these places or it's not ending up in the places where it's more likely to be misused or a certain percentage, to go to the Chief Justice's point, are being misused?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice Kavanaugh, I think what you've described would qualify under Twitter as general awareness.\n\nIt would not qualify as specific culpable participation.\n\nIf you had a -- a manufacturer --\n\nJudge: You know -- you know you make baseball bats, and you know they're being used in a --in a particular way in particular areas by particular gangs.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So --\n\nJudge: And -- and you should -- so, therefore, you know, we got to make sure that we're not selling to those sporting goods stores that are in particular neighborhoods.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think the --the first lawyerly response is that guns and drugs tend to be treated differently than things like knives and baseball bats.\n\nBut, even that aside, if you knew that your baseball bats --\n\nJudge: Well, prescription --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: --were being --\n\nJudge: -- drugs too.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Prescription drugs were being sold into a particular pharmacy -- and this has happened, of course, in the opioid cases -- were being sold into a particular pharmacy at -- you know, in a small town at numbers that were simply unsustainable and you knew that you were continuing to sell after being told by the federal government that you were selling into a rogue dealer and you continued to sell into that dealer, then, yes, you would have a problem.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "545", "dialogue": "Judge: And we're asked to weigh -- and this discussion seems to be summing up, at least in part, two difficult circumstances. On one hand, a suggestion that it's harmless or might be absurd to require the government to fill in a TBD. Congress may have thought dates were important, but, nah, they're not that important. And on the other hand, the potential that a non-citizen might be removed from the country in absentia without any notice of the charges against them, their right to an attorney, the facts of their case, based on a compliant notice of change that just says \"show up on a date certain,\" and they don't know where it's coming from necessarily or who. Then, clear and convincing evidence in whatever form that the government may supply in a non-adversarial proceeding, an inquisitorial proceeding before its own employee and an immigration judge. How do we weigh those two consequential arguments?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor. So I think the short answer is that Congress has done that weighing for you. The date and time are situated no differently from the other information listed in paragraph (1). But even if we were to do the weighing, as Your Honor noted, the first downside is entirely within the government's control. The government can simply put a date and time on the notice to appear, as it acknowledged nearly 30 years ago that the statute required it to do.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-citizen has no control over whether they get adequate notice. And so, in the hypothetical you're describing, where they are never told of the charges against them and are removed in absentia without an opportunity to present their case before the immigration judge, that’s a severe sanction. Congress recognized how draconian this could be, which is why in absentia removal orders can be reopened at any time if there's inadequate notice.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: You say inadequate notice, but they had notice.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's right, Your Honor. Again, Congress replaced the reasonable notice regime with notice in accordance with paragraphs (1) or (2). So rather than a case-by-case determination, Congress simply required the government to comply with these two paragraphs. It thought that this approach would make things easier for the government—just follow these precise instructions, put the required seven pieces of information on a notice, and no further case-by-case analysis is needed.\n\nJudge: Well, Congress was concerned, correct me if I’m wrong, about people not showing up for their removal hearings, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s exactly right. Congress believed that the prior reasonable notice system gave too much discretion to immigration judges to say, “This person was confused, this person got this document but not that document.” So Congress made it easier for the government to obtain in absentia removal orders by stating, “Government, comply with the statute, and you’ll get your removal order. The non-citizen cannot complain that the notice to appear was confusing.”\n\nJudge: Why wouldn’t a non-citizen show up if they get a notice stating the time and place of their removal proceeding and that failure to appear results in removal?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Your Honor, the non-citizen does have every incentive to show up. Among other things, if they don’t, ICE can arrest them and bring them to the hearing. The government can obtain an in absentia removal order fairly straightforwardly. Even if the initial NTA was defective, all it takes at that hearing is for the government to print out a new one with the correct date and time.\n\nJudge: No, I understand there are incentives. I’m just talking about statutory language. Justice Alito pointed out the text of this provision. If a non-citizen knows the critical information—date, time, and the consequence of failing to appear—why would it be draconian for Congress to say that person could be removed in absentia if they didn’t show up?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Congress could have structured the system that way, but it did not. Before 1996, there was a different system—\n\nJudge: Okay, but why? Why wouldn’t it make sense? Let’s say I disagree with your argument about the NTA and believe the removal proceeding is the appropriate place to register objections. Why wouldn’t it make sense for a non-citizen, knowing the time and date, to show up? What incentive would they have not to, aside from just refusing to attend?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: In Niz-Chavez, this Court likened the NTA to an indictment in a criminal case.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And in a criminal case, we don’t say, “Just show up, or we’ll incarcerate you.”\n\nJudge: But what’s the incentive? Are you saying this is just a technicality?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don’t think it’s a technicality, any more than an indictment in a criminal case is a technicality.\n\nJudge: So your entire argument hinges on interpreting (a)(1) as requiring all of the information, or else the NTA is completely invalid?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s right. Practically, a non-citizen needs to know what they’re defending against—what the government is alleging, on what basis, and what statutory claims they face. Congress could not have intended a system where someone is required to appear on a given date and time, under threat of in absentia removal, without even knowing what they are defending against.\n\nJudge: But couldn’t the non-citizen just show up and say, “I don’t know what the government is alleging against me,” and the immigration judge could then determine that the government’s notice was inadequate?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s possible, but the statute doesn’t leave that decision solely to an immigration judge’s discretion. The government must provide something akin to an indictment—notice of the charges—so the non-citizen knows what to expect before appearing.\n\nJudge: If both a non-citizen with a complete NTA and one with a defective NTA receive a notice to appear on June 15, are they really different? If both show up, there’s no in absentia removal, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s right. If they appear, no removal in absentia occurs. However, under paragraph (1), which mandates that a proper notice to appear be issued in every removal proceeding, a person with a defective NTA could still object.\n\nJudge: And if neither of them show up, a removal order is issued. But one can move to reopen the case while the other cannot, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, with one caveat—we don’t believe an immigration judge should issue the removal order in the first place under (b)(5)(A).\n\nJudge: But assuming they do, the person with the defective NTA can reopen the case, and the other cannot?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Exactly.\n\nJudge: Is there anything strange about Congress policing its own requirements in this way—allowing one person to reopen but not the other?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, Your Honor. Congress structured it this way to ensure that the government follows the statute’s notice requirements.\n\nJudge: And regarding the government’s concern that people won’t show up, isn’t Congress addressing that issue differently? The law allows people with in absentia removal orders to move to rescind them under certain conditions. If someone doesn’t show up, they have the burden of proving they never received notice or that the notice was defective.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That’s correct. Congress ensured that the government must meet its statutory obligations in order to obtain the procedural advantage of an in absentia removal.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That's our basic pitch about a redemption obligation.\nI would just add that the other part of our pitch is that the hole in their case is that they are trying to value Michael's shares after Crown already redeemed them.\nYou can't do that.\nThe price paid out for Michael's shares is value that goes to Michael's shares.\nIf you subtract that as a $3 million liability before trying to value Michael's shares, you will never get the correct answer.\n\nJudge: Thank you, further?

{"id": "838", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, counsel. Let's suppose the state takes some action, you claim that as a taking, and you bring that claim for just compensation. In the state court, they decide yes, it was a taking, and so the government owes you $3 million. And the government says: Wow, we didn't think it was worth that much. Here, take it back. Can they do that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: To a point, Your Honor. I think saying \"here, take it back\" runs afoul of what was identified in a prior dissent—that ending the taking just creates an uncompensated temporary taking. That is why, as noted in a previous ruling, just stopping the taking creates an uncompensated temporary taking. Certainly, the state is within its rights to cease a taking if it wants to cease a taking, and it may be that evidence at trial shows Texas has chosen to cease the taking here, but the question is always based on the full factual record—what property interest has Texas actually taken?\n\nJudge: So they can claim what they've taken is a temporary right, so they owe you rent, and that's just compensation?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Exactly, Your Honor. The defendant is always free to say this is just a temporary easement or maybe a temporary partial easement.\n\nJudge: And they can say that after the fact?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I— I think—\n\nJudge: We took the whole thing, we found out we were taking more than we could chew, so we're going to give it back to you?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that would be a valid ground for going back to the district court and saying that the facts have changed.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?\n\nJudge: Well, suppose that going forward they find a way to divert the water so that it doesn't cause flooding in the future. Then what claim would you have?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that would just be a claim for a temporary easement, Your Honor. Ultimately, the property interest in this case would be some kind of flooding easement. The trial court would have to decide whether it's a permanent easement, a partial easement, or a temporary easement. This is the kind of determination courts make in takings cases every day.\n\nJudge: Yeah, and if it's completely eliminated going forward—your property is not going to be flooded anymore—what would the remedy be?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The remedy—so, to the extent the Court found on the facts that Texas had taken a temporary easement, it would be the fair market value of that temporary easement.\n\nJudge: Would that be different from damages?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: In what way would it be different from damages?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Damages are an attempt to rectify a wrongful act. A plaintiff seeking damages can seek consequential damages. For example, if they had been paid on time, they could have pursued a business opportunity that they had to forego.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I understand that. So how would you put a value on the temporary taking?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Generally speaking, there is testimony from dueling appraisers who talk about what rent someone would pay for that kind of easement or what a willing seller would have sold that easement for. But it's limited to fair market value—what the government took—as distinct from what the property owner may have lost.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Okay. Thank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Mr. Nielson.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court will be hard-pressed to find any government more committed to property than Texas. The Texas Constitution is more protective than the federal Constitution, and Texas courts adjudicate takings claims under both constitutions.\n\nThis appeal isn’t about substantive rights. All Petitioners had to do was use Texas's cause of action. Instead, Petitioners insist they can bring a cause of action directly under the federal Takings Clause.\n\nThis argument is wrong for many reasons. For one, it ignores what the Constitution says. Governments must provide just compensation, but the Takings Clause says nothing about how they must do it—whether through commissions, private bills, or litigation.\n\nFor another, this Court held in a prior case that Congress may constitutionally \"retain for itself the power to hear and determine controversies respecting claims against the United States.\" It follows that, as previously ruled, \"there is no constitutional right to a judicial remedy.\"\n\nPetitioners argue none of this matters because of a prior ruling, but that decision was about substance, not procedure. And even if there were a procedural holding, Texas satisfies it. We have a cause of action for federal takings claims. Petitioners simply refuse to use it.\n\nWe welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: How would that cause of action work? What would it look like?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I would point the Court to the Texas Supreme Court's decision in a prior case, where they hear claims under both the Texas and federal Constitutions, and then resolve the claim under existing precedents.\n\nJudge: Let's say we affirm here. Can Petitioners' constitutional right be vindicated now in Texas courts?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, in federal court. The problem is they haven't pleaded the claim. So, at this point, they'd have to get leave from the district court to amend their complaint if they wanted to bring a claim under the Texas cause of action.\n\nThere are still live claims here. There's still a claim under the Texas Constitution, and they have federal due process claims. This is an interlocutory appeal.\n\nSo, they would have to get leave from the district court to amend their complaint to bring a claim under Texas common law.

{"id": "821", "dialogue": "Judge: They've had a couple of cases like this.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Have they?\nJudge: Mr. Kneedler referred to the Bartlett case.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And how are they going?\nJudge: So far, they have not applied the necessity defense. They left open the possibility that it might apply, but they haven't applied it yet.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Why not?\nJudge: They didn't find that it was necessary under those circumstances. And, again, we—\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Did they rule out that it might be necessary under some circumstances?\nJudge: They left open that possibility, but I'd also say the civil citation or the— I don't want to say \"civil.\" It's a little murky. But the fines here are not subject, I don't think, or it's not clear, to the necessity defense. So it wouldn't take care of the entirety of the claim.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: You've got the Excessive Fines Clause there, though, right?\nJudge: Yes.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And that's not before us either?\nJudge: We have raised the fines before this Court because our challenge is to the package of punishments, and, historically, that's how the Court has looked at applying the Excessive Fines Clause and the Punishment Clause together.\nWe're in a really unfortunate posture here that we have claims that involve both fines and punishment, and yet we're only here on the Punishments Clause piece of it.\nIt was one of the reasons we suggested this isn't a great vehicle. I think the Court can say that, you know, it's not going to reach the fines because we won on that below, and so you can just focus on the jail time for criminal trespass.\n\nJudge: What is your definition of the status of homelessness? Is it the lack of a place to stay indoors on a particular night, or is it something broader than that?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So—so homelessness—\nJudge: Does it require more than that?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right. Homelessness is defined as lacking a fixed, regular, adequate nighttime address.\nSo, if you have a home, you have a home— I'm not homeless when I go to Grants Pass because I have a home in D.C.\nThe second part of our class definition focuses on whether the homeless person has access to shelter.\nThat's not because that's part of the status. It's because, when someone has access to shelter, then the ordinances aren't punishing them for the status.\nIt's punishing them for the conduct of not going—\nJudge: Well, I asked the question because if homelessness is defined as simply lacking a place to stay indoors on a particular night, then there is an ironclad connection between the conduct, which is sleeping outside, and the status of homelessness.\nBut if homelessness is defined to require more than that, then my question would be whether someone who is lacking a place to stay on a particular night or for a particular period of time is homeless, if the reason why the person finds himself or herself in that status is, for example, the person refuses to take antipsychotic medicine that's been prescribed or refuses to go to drug rehab or rehabilitation for alcoholism or the person has chosen to move from one place where the person might have shelter or a home where the person could live to another place.\nWhat about all of that?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the status of homelessness is something that only changes once the person has a home.\nYou lose your home, you're homeless. If you have a home again, then you're not in the status anymore.\nI think what your question gets at is that second piece, which is whether a person has access to shelter. That can change from day to day. And so—\nJudge: No, that's not really what my question gets at.\nThe question is you can draw a distinction—status is different from conduct, but there are some instances of conduct that are closely tied to status, or if homelessness is defined as simply lacking a place to stay on a particular night, they amount to the same thing.\nThe definition of homelessness encompasses the conduct of sleeping outside.\nSo my question is whether this is—what if the person finds that person in a homeless state because of prior life choices or their refusal to make future life choices? That's the question.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah, yeah. So our definition of lacking access to shelter is lacking physical or legal access to shelter. And you're looking at the person's situation on that particular night.\nI think generally we're not doing an inquiry into all of a person's life choices that might have led them to the point where they're homeless and can't find a place to sleep.\nRobinson certainly didn't do that sort of analysis with respect to addiction, but there could be situations where there is such a tight causal nexus between a choice a person has made and their lack of shelter access that you would say this person has chosen not to take this shelter.\nAnd to be very clear, if you decline shelter that is physically and legally available to you, you're not in a class—you're in—\nJudge: Well, see, but the problem is that once you move away from the definition that makes the inquiry basically tautological, then you get into the question of assessing the closeness of the connection between the status and the conduct.\nAnd you do run into problems with the person who's a kleptomaniac, or a person who suffers from pedophilia.\nSo how do you distinguish that? How does the Court assess how close the connection has to be?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So—for both of those categories, the status is defined—I don't know if status is the right word there—being a pedophile or having pedophilia is defined by the urge that you have, not by your conduct and acting on that urge.\nSo if someone were to act on that urge, that tight causal nexus on why they didn't have access to shelter, then they would be outside of our claim.\n\nJudge: I thought you made a very interesting remark in response to the previous question, and I'm just trying to clarify.\nYou seem to say that homelessness, as you've defined, is not lacking access to shelter on a particular night.\nIs that—am I right about that?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's right.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I mean, the reason why we're in absentia world is because they don't show up.\nSo I guess I'm confused about the Chief Justice's hypothetical and how it relates to this statute or this circumstance that we're talking about.

The statute was not actually designed for a situation in which the government systematically puts TBD instead of the -- the sort of date and time of the charges.\nIt was designed for the kind of one-off mistake, you put the wrong person's name on this or sent this to the wrong address. And so, you know, what Congress thought it was doing was coming up with a scheme that put all the cards in the government's hands.\nIt said we're not going to ask on a case-by-case basis did the non-citizen have enough notice and allow them to say I was confused, I got this document and not this document.\nWe're just going to give the government all the power.\nAll you need to do, government, is put these seven pieces of information on one piece of paper.\n\nJudge: But Congress was concerned --\n\nJudge: Maybe --\n\nJudge: Well, as to what Congress thought it was doing, you filed a brief on behalf of Mr. Singh.\nAre you able to address the situation of Mr. Mendez-Colin?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: All right.\nSo, in Mr. Mendez-Colin's case, his removal proceeding began in 2001, and after that, he showed up at numerous hearings, the dates were changed. And you say Congress would have wanted him at this late date to be able to reopen his removal proceedings because he didn't get a compliant NTA back in 2001?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\nCongress expressly said at any time, in contrast to numerous other provisions allowing --\n\nJudge: Counsel, that -- I think there's a difference between the right to make a motion to reopen than to have it reopened. Are you arguing that if there was a deficient notice in this situation under (a)(1), that the Board has to reopen, or does it have the discretion to consider a forfeiture or a waiver argument?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So certainly, Your Honor. There's several provisions outside the scope of the question presented in this case that can deal with any sort of gamesmanship. So, as Your Honor noted, there are equitable doctrines. The government can raise waiver, forfeiture, estoppel.\nThere are doctrines -- there's statutory provisions about the subsequent hearing.\nSo, for instance, under 1229a(b)(7), if the -- if the non-citizen had oral notice of the time and place of the hearing, they aren't eligible to apply for various forms of discretionary relief.\n\nJudge: Well, counsel, could you answer the question that I -- I don't think you had -- really had a chance to answer the question that I asked, which is whether -- you talked about what Congress thought it was doing, and my question was, do you think Congress really thought it was doing what you are claiming should be the result in Mendez-Colin's case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that Congress didn't anticipate the government would ignore the text of the statute.\nThe reason that Congress put in the \"at any time\" hook is because they imagined these would be one-off circumstances where something gets lost in the mail or the government makes a typo and so switches two non-citizens' paperwork. They were not imagining sort of systematically ignoring the statute for many years.\nAnd so, yes, at this point, the statute probably leads to results Congress didn't intend, but that's a function of the government flouting the plain text of the statute and shouldn't be -- shouldn't have any bearing on your reading of the remedial provision.\n\nJudge: Well, as to the plain text of the statute, we've now had, like, an hour and 17 minutes of argument, and virtually nothing has been said about the plain text of 1229a(b)(5)(A).\n\nPereira and Niz-Chavez were literal interpretations of the statute. Now there's an answer to what I'm going to say, but I'll get to that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Okay.\n\nJudge: But, if you read the provision I just mentioned literally, you lose, right? Any alien who after written notice required under paragraph (1) or (2) has been provided to the alien, okay, notice under (2) was provided, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we -- we disagree with that.\nSo we don't think notice under (2) was provided because (2) is a supplement to a valid (1).\nAnd so, without a valid (1), you can't have a paragraph (2) there.\nSo our position is that neither notice in accordance with paragraph (1) --\n\nJudge: I'm just talking about the literal language of the statute.\nI'm not talking about what was held in Pereira or Niz-Chavez, which concerned very -- a different question.\nYou keep saying they held this, they held that.\nWhat they held had to do with the stop-time rule.\nJust the literal language of this, that's against you, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I disagree because we think there's been no paragraph (2) notice.\nSo you can't have notice required under paragraph (1) or (2) if you've neither gotten paragraph (1) notice -- that's the government's position in this case -- nor paragraph (2) notice, which is our contention about how you read paragraph (a)(2).", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "81", "dialogue": "Judge: No, I understand. I'm just asking you, is it a jurisdictional provision?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I'm not sure.\n\nI think courts of appeals have treated the 60-day provision as jurisdictional for appeal.\n\nI'm not sure that they've treated who constitutes a party as being jurisdictional, but what I would say to that, Judge, is that in all of those Hobbs Act conditions, you should look at the organic statute for the Commission first because the FCC has two different appellate mechanisms.\n\nOne is a Hobbs Act provision and the other is not a Hobbs Act provision.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nWell, I -- I'm just trying to understand the argument that I think you're now making, which is that there's a difference between being an intervenor party for the purpose of any party aggrieved and being a party who wants to make the particular claim of ultra vires.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well --\n\nJudge: You say you're the latter, but you admit you're not the former.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, what I'm -- I think we were the former.\n\nI think the language --\n\nJudge: Well, you didn't -- you didn't get intervenor -- intervenor status.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I'm not challenging that, Judge, but I'm not saying we're not aggrieved.\n\nWe clearly are aggrieved.\n\nAnd we are aggrieved under any --\n\nJudge: I didn't ask you whether you were aggrieved.\n\nI'm trying to figure out whether you're a party.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And -- and -- and -- and the distinction that you've now made is the difference between parties who were intervenors and parties who would like to claim ultra vires. I don't see any statutory basis for that distinction, but I'm just trying to even understand where it comes from.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: What I'm saying, Judge, is there are two routes for us to assert our party status, okay? One is under the Atomic Energy Act, which we clearly satisfy. The other is under the Commission's rules for intervention, which the Commission ruled against us on.\n\nI acknowledge we lost the second one and it's not before this Court.\n\nBut that doesn't mean we don't satisfy the statutory requirements that would be --\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nI understand your argument.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nMr. Nielson.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Judge, and may it please the Court: I hope to make several additional points, but I want to start with three quick ones.\n\nFirst, the Hobbs Act covers a wide variety of orders.\n\nUnder Clark v. Martinez, where one provision has multiple applications, the Court applies a lowest common denominator interpretation to all of them.\n\nEven in the D.C. Circuit, if you file comments, that's enough to challenge a rule and a declaratory ruling in adjudication.\n\nSecond, Congress added to the AEA the NWPA's definition of \"spent nuclear fuel.\" The Court needs to interpret today's AEA and address Petitioners' obvious superfluity. And, finally, you know, if anyone thinks this is temporary, I have a bridge to sell you.\n\nThere's no way that we're going to move 140,000 tons of nuclear waste in 60 years.\n\nWhat the Commission has just done is put a permanent terrorist bulls-eye on the most productive oil field in America.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: You did not intervene, so why are you a party now?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct, Your Honor. So, I mean, listen, effectively, we did intervene, but I would say this goes back to understanding of the Hobbs Act.\n\nThe Hobbs Act does not just apply to this agency.\n\nIt applies to a whole bunch of agencies and a whole bunch of different types of orders.\n\nSo, if you file a comment in an FCC rulemaking, you're good.\n\nOr, even at the D.C. Circuit, if you file a declaratory ruling, which is a form of adjudication, you discussed this in McKesson, that's also -- it's enough to file a comment.\n\nSo that's what Texas did here.\n\nAnd I think it's important to understand kind of what happened.\n\nJudge: But, General --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- I mean, this was an adjudicatory proceeding.\n\nSo the way people understand who parties are in an adjudicative proceeding, it's -- it's not enough to send in a letter.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "793", "dialogue": "Judge: It -- it surely would be irresponsible for the government to say we're not going to put him on the No Fly List no matter what?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: We put him on earlier for some particular reason, we've now found out he has a nuclear weapon, but we said we wouldn't put him on, so we're not going to put him on. I don't see how you can ask them to say anything more than what they've said. Now maybe we'll decide that that's not enough, but you can't really expect them to say more than that. He's not on the list, as far as we know, any other reason he's not -- we're not going to put him on the list for the same reasons.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, for example, Your Honor, they could moot the procedural due process claim without disclosing any reasons at all about why the plaintiff was put on the list because that just deals with the procedures itself. On the substance -- on the reasons, you're right, Your Honor, that it's -- it's -- it's up to the government to decide whether to disclose or not to disclose. And if the government chooses not to disclose, that doesn't mean that they've lost the case. Instead, it just means that they have to defend it on the merits.\n\nJudge: Well, I appreciate that -- you're right, but that's not what I was saying. I want to know, am I right about the idea that there's no way they could issue -- say anything about what the future would hold in terms of the national security interests? They can't say you've got a, you know, free pass, whatever you want to do, we're not going to put you on the No Fly List?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Of course not, Your Honor. And I think the government has made it easy by saying nothing at all about what it'll do in the future, but it could have made a limited promise. It could have said we disclosed -- we put him on the list for a mistake, and now we've addressed that mistake, and we think that this explanation shows that that mistake is unlikely to recur, or they said we disclose the reasons, we identified that they're illegal in X, Y, and Z manner, that's against our policy.\n\nJudge: Well, but you're -- that's where I wonder if you're going back to the situation where you're insisting on a statement to the effect that they were wrong. It was -- in fact, you said it was a mistake or -- or whatever. And mootness has never required that type of determination or that type of assertion. It's just solely -- it's forward-looking and that's the only -- you're not entitled to, to establish mootness, a determination that what they did in the past was wrong.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, we agree with that, that repudiation is not required. But repudiation is forward-looking, even though it deals with the past for one. If -- if a party acknowledges that what they did was illegal, was wrong, or perhaps was not what they would want to do or how they want their program to work, that -- that's an example of a government moving away from its prior decision. And the -- the -- the humble fact, the humble point, jurisprudential point of repudiation is that a party that steps away from what it's done in the past is less likely to repeat that behavior in the future.\n\nJudge: Well, but in Already, we said no matter how vigorous the dispute remains between the parties, that's not the question.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yeah -- yes. And in Already, the company had made a promise that covered every shoe that it was currently making, every shoe that it had made in the past, and any future imitation of those shoes. That would be like, instead of the declaration saying currently available information, it would have said we disclose here are the reasons we put you on a list, we promise not to use those same reasons again in the future and enumerated them. That's not what the government did here. And because the government didn't take -- didn't do -- didn't take one step towards Your Honor's position, it -- it -- it -- it simplifies this Court's analysis. There's -- there's simply no repudiation. There's an embrace of their past conduct.\n\nJudge: Does that mean that if you're on the No Fly List, your case is never moot if the government is unwilling to say more than it said here?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor. If -- if we were bringing this case today, I think that we wouldn't be able to make out standing. And so this is -- this case deals with a unique situation which, in my colleague's telling, is -- is -- is rare, where a person files a lawsuit and, at the time they file the lawsuit, everybody agrees they're on the No Fly List and there's standing. During the course of litigation, the government removes that person from the No Fly List. That doesn't make the case moot. That triggers the application of this Court's voluntary cessation doctrine to determine whether it is moot or isn't moot. The application of the voluntary cessation doctrine is demanding. It assigns the government -- it assigns the party moving for mootness the burden, and it uses this language over and over and over again, absolutely clear. And I think, Your Honor, that the failure to disclose the reasons for the listing short-circuits this Court's analysis of whether or not they've met their burden.\n\nJudge: You said, if it were filed today, there would be no standing. Can you explain why you think that?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I think, Your Honor, we fit within the situation described in Laidlaw where sometimes, when you're making a projection of what's going to happen in the future, you -- the -- the -- the showing that you have to make to demonstrate standing is going to be higher than the showing that you have to make to defeat mootness. Here, in this case, we're -- we think that the -- where the burden is assigned is important and -- and what the case turns on.\n\nJudge: Isn't the answer also that there's just like no basic redressability from the standing standpoint at this point in time? So, in other words, he's off the list now. If he showed up in court tomorrow not on the list, initiating a lawsuit and asking to be taken off the No Fly List as one of his, you know -- or even perhaps a declaration that when he was previously on the No Fly List, that was a problem, I would think there would be a legitimate argument on the government's part that he had no standing to proceed. But what saves you in this case is that he actually initiated this when he did have standing. And the government concedes that. And so now the whole exercise becomes under what circumstance can the government stop the case that was already in motion at the time that it was legitimately -- you know, stop a case that was legitimately started pursuant to Article III. It's on the government then to show that this is now moot as a result of something that they did.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, it is on the government. And -- and -- and, here, what -- what underscores Your Honor's point is that the plaintiff doesn't -- he was living his law-abiding everyday life when the government put him on the No Fly List. He still doesn't know why he was put on the No Fly List. And so I think that is -- because the No Fly List operates under that cloak of secrecy, that that creates a problem for them meeting their burden.\n\nJudge: Can I --\n\nJudge: Would you answer --\n\nJudge: -- come back to the question of what might be said in a declaration that would be sufficient to show that it was sufficiently unlikely that he would be put back on the list? Short of repudiation or a change of circumstances, am I correct that your answer is that there must be a disclosure of the reasons why he was on in the first place?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: For the substantive due process claim, yes, Your Honor, we think that a disclosure of some kind is the only way for establishing a baseline that the court can then compare a promise to.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And under subsection (b)(9), the statute contemplates that all of these things will get funneled into a proceeding in the court of appeals.\n\nAnd so to say that there's -- that this should have been raised differently doesn't account for the fact that this is the proceeding in which these issues should be raised.\n\nJudge 3:\nMr. Cedrone --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nOh.\n\nJudge 3:\n-- can I ask you one question about jurisdiction and one question about the merits.\n\nOn jurisdiction, Justice Sotomayor pointed out that this seems to be a one -off case.\n\nI just want to clarify with you -- and the government can speak to this too if the answer is different -- how often does it happen that someone like your client simply challenges the motion to reconsider and not the other -- the underlying order? Is -- is this very unusual so that this jurisdictional question wouldn't really frequently arise?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI confess that I --I don't have a sense of the -- the balance of that, other than to say that, as I was just describing, motions to reopen often come up years after the final order of removal and may involve questions of changed factual circumstances or other things that entitle you to relief from removal.\n\nAnd so I think, on the government's view, this case is a one-off, not in that the government is taking the position that this issue is never reviewable, just that you have to bundle it in your petition with some sort of challenge, however slight, to your removability to seize the court of jurisdiction.\n\nAnd I don't see any support for that in the statute.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "720", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-867, Hungary versus Simon.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hungary and its national railway, MAV, are immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act unless the expropriation exception applies, and a key phrase in that exception is \"exchanged for.\" There's no dispute that \"to exchange\" means to give one thing in return for another.\n\nAccordingly, domestic courts have jurisdiction over this case only if some present-day asset having a commercial nexus with the United States was given in return for items taken from 14 individuals in 1944.\n\nRespondents have not even attempted to make that showing.\n\nInstead, they rest their case on the theory that all fungible assets of Hungary, its agencies, and its instrumentalities were given in return for those specific items taken more than six decades before this case was filed.\n\nThat's simply inconsistent with ordinary meaning.\n\nAnd while this case can be decided on text alone, history and context confirm the limited scope of the expropriation exception. It arose from congressional opposition to a particular decision of this Court, the Sabbatino decision, which concerned identifiable and traceable property.\n\nWhen Congress enacted the FSIA, it intended to codify the restrictive view of foreign sovereign immunity, not to work a radical transformation of international law.\n\nBut the commingling theory would do just that.\n\nIt would undermine important limits in other provisions of the statute and would require U.S. courts to decide claims having no real connection to this country.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit substantively erred in adopting the commingling theory, and it committed two procedural errors.\n\nIt imposed a burden of production on sovereign defendants rather than the proponents of jurisdiction, and it declined to ask whether Respondents' allegations made out a valid claim to jurisdiction.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit's opinion should be reversed, and this case should be dismissed.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: What was -- and -- and under your theory, what would Respondent have to show in order to make out jurisdiction using -- employing the commingling theory?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think there are several types of evidence that a plaintiff could use to establish an exchange even after commingling.\n\nSo, first, there's the type of mathematical evidence, the most obvious example being a withdrawal from a commingled account that could not have occurred but for a deposit of tainted funds given the prior balance.\n\nSecond, you can imagine direct evidence, instructions to an accountant to run illegal proceeds through the books of a company before depositing them into a personal account.\n\nAnd, third, you can imagine indirect evidence.\n\nYou might have an atypical deposit of a specific amount into an account, followed shortly thereafter by a withdrawal in the same amount.\n\nUnder those circumstances, a fact finder might be able to conclude that an exchange has occurred using ordinary meaning.\n\nBut simply showing that funds entered into the general revenues of an entire nation that, you know, contain billions of dollars, followed by untold numbers of transactions following that deposit, simply isn't consistent with the plain text.\n\nJudge: What if there's -- the country has an account that is 95 percent composed of funds from appropriated property, 5 percent isn't? Is your argument still the same? And -- and the entity in the United States spends less than 5 percent of the proceedings.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think there are close questions, but, in -- in those circumstances, maybe a fact finder could say it's at least as likely as not that tainted funds are involved.\n\nAnd the details would matter, temporal proximity, as I said, whether there's either direct or indirect evidence, but, potentially, those types of claims could qualify, yes.\n\nJudge: So it doesn't matter -- commingling doesn't mean that it's some taint from property that is -- is -- funds that are not from appropriation? That can't be the entire rule?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nWe're not suggesting that commingling is fatal.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, commingling will make it impossible to trace funds.\n\nBut the ultimate question is -- is simply whether, in ordinary meaning, somebody would refer to the subsequent withdrawal as being exchanged for the initial deposit.\n\nJudge: And doesn't this provide a roadmap to any country that wants to expropriate property? In other words, just sell the property, put it into your national treasury, insulate yourself from all claims for all time?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think this Court was clear in Altmann that the FSIA was not intended to direct or incentivize other nations in the ordering of their affairs.\n\nIt's not a substantive --\n\nJudge: Well, I was just sort of suggesting that Congress wouldn't have wanted to write a provision that has no meaning.\n\nAnd, under your theory, I think that there would be precious little meaning to this because it really just, you know, gives foreign countries an easy way to expropriate property and make sure there's no accountability for that expropriation.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'd make three points in response.\n\nFirst, the FSIA doesn't make expropriation unlawful.\n\nOther forums may be available where an unlawful taking could be litigated or perhaps settled through international espousal.\n\nSecond, Congress knew that these types of claims would be rare.\n\nIt was informed when it passed the second Hickenlooper amendment that it would apply to a tiny fraction of expropriation claims around the world.\n\nThe Congress was attempting to overrule Sabbatino, not to establish a broad new type of claim that would work, again, a radical transformation of international law.\n\nAnd, third, regardless of what this Court decides in terms of the commingling theory, foreign nations can avoid U.S. courts regardless.\n\nA foreign nation could expropriate property, segregate it, and keep those proceeds out of the United States and thereby avoid the commingling theory even if it were adopted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "958", "dialogue": "Judge: You don't think this kind of eviscerates the kind of exacting control that Congress usually exercises in the appropriations process?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't. And, you know, to the extent that this question is pressing on the annual appropriations—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —as a kind of counterpart here, I think that the question becomes, does the Constitution limit Congress with respect to the duration of appropriations? Is there some kind of implicit limit in the text that the Court could divine that means that Congress, in contrast to other laws, which, of course, can remain in effect until a future Congress acts—is Congress limited in how long to leave appropriations in effect? And, there, I think the Army Appropriations Clause does a lot of work because it's not like the Framers weren't aware of this dynamic.\nThey thought specifically about the fact that appropriations, like all other laws, might be continuing, indefinite until a future Congress acts, and they were concerned about that with respect to a standing Army, but they didn't otherwise seek to limit Congress's authority.\n\nJudge: Counsel, one of the things that struck me as I was reading it—you have a very aggressive view of Congress's authority under the Appropriations Clause.\nI'm not saying remotely that that's not correct, but it struck me—you represent the executive branch as well, and it's a very strong power given to Congress. And it struck me that the reason you would want to defend that is because it gives them more power to give away.\nAnd there are obviously—legend has it there have been times when the same party controlled both houses of Congress and the White House, and in that situation, you can see Congress empowering the President in a way that might seem unusual to the Framers.\nSo keeping in mind that imbalance—in other words, it's kind of paradoxical, the more power you give Congress, I think, the more—and this is, I think, your friend’s argument on the other side—there’s more that it can give away and enhance the authority of the executive. Is that an unpersuasive concern?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, certainly, I don't think it's an unpersuasive concern, but built into your question as I understood it, Your Honor, was the idea that maybe Congress could do something that would be surprising or anomalous to the Framers.\nAnd I guess what I would say is that if—if you're looking at it through that lens, then history should play a powerful role in trying to understand the limits or scope of, you know, how much Congress can give away, when does it become too much.\nAnd, here, the Court doesn't need to articulate any outer limits because we have a very specific type of appropriation that's actually far more constrained than many that Congress has enacted throughout history because Congress provided funding for a single agency and actually capped that amount of funding in an amount not to exceed the cap set by Congress.\n\nJudge: Well, it's pretty unusual to have that agency drawing its—being able to request however much it wants, subject to a limit that it really hasn't gotten very close to over the years, from an entity that is also drawing money from the private sector.\nI didn't see any particularly compelling historical analogues to that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, let me—\n\nJudge: And, again, to the extent that takes you away from the appropriations power, it significantly enhances the power of the executive.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I disagree that there is anything unprecedented about this funding arrangement when you look at the relevant constitutional value of protecting Congress's prerogatives.\nAnd I know that there are a lot of different moving parts and pieces to the arguments Respondents have made, but as I understand it, they are attacking four features of the funding statute:\n\nThe fact that it's a standing appropriation, so it remains in place and is not time-limited.\n\nThat it gives the director of the CFPB some discretion to act within the statutory cap in requesting the funding.\n\nThat the CFPB has enforcement and regulatory functions.\n\nThat the CFPB’s funding comes from a source that’s not, in their words, constrained by market forces.\n\nBut we have numerous examples of agencies that have all four of those relevant characteristics.\nI dispute at the outset that we don't actually think the functions or the market forces constraint are relevant, but even taking the argument on its own terms, I can give you founding-era examples.\nThe Customs Service and the revenue officers were funded with that kind of mechanism.\nThey had standing appropriations. For the Customs Service, it was uncapped. These were powerful regulatory entities.\nThe Customs Service could board ships and seize vessels and inspect records and conduct searches and levy penalties and collect fines, and there was no way to avoid that kind of regulation.\nSo the market constraint theory that the users could just opt out or regulated parties could decide not to fund the operations doesn't apply to those agencies.\nAnd it's still the case with many of the financial regulators today.\nThe ones I would put on that list are the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the NCUA, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I just want to understand, following up on the previous question, what role the upper limit plays on your theory of the case.\nIs that an essential feature to the constitutionality of this provision, or could Congress pass the same law with no upper limit, allowing the executive branch to determine however much it wished to take?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So we don't think that Congress would have to provide a statutory specified amount, but they would, of course, have to specify the purpose of the funding.\n\nJudge: Okay.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "328", "dialogue": "Defendant’s Lawyer: So I think the Court could say that we haven't decided whether there's ever any entitlement to an interim hearing, but assuming that there could be such a requirement in some category of cases, it clearly would not—Petitioners were not entitled to that sort of hearing in this particular case.\n\nNow, there may be some dangers in kicking it down the road. I think there will be other petitions coming up because of the Sixth Circuit's decision and even coming out of Krimstock. But the Court definitely could save this for another day if the Court wanted to.\n\nJudge: I—I thought you were going to say that the—that we could say that there's no due process right to an interim hearing, period, but there could be other due process issues related to other aspects of forfeiture proceedings and you don't need to rule those problems out by saying there's no due process right to an interim hearing.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's certainly our preferred rule. I think I was assuming that the Court wanted a much more limited rule that just dealt with the facts of this case. But as I said in my opening, we certainly think that the Court has already indicated that there's no—\n\nJudge: So what do you—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —due process right to—\n\nJudge: —see Barker being, if it's not an interim hearing?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I—\n\nJudge: I mean, Barker, a defendant, a Petitioner comes in, makes a motion and says I'm entitled to a Barker hearing. The government claims its interests but I have hardship. And I want a hearing on the level of my hardship versus their interest and their level of proof?\n\nBecause your brief seems to argue that the Mathews test is fully consistent with and would not require any material changes in the Court's traditional Barker-based analysis.\n\nThat's your brief at page 19.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think I want to—\n\nJudge: So due process does require Barker hearings. That's what we said in $8,850, and basically you just don't want to call it a retention hearing?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think I want to be clear of where we are in the analytical framework here. So we don't think there's ever a right to an interim hearing. We think the only right that there is, is a timely final forfeiture hearing.\n\nAnd it's certainly true that someone whose forfeiture proceedings are ongoing can say: Look, this is moving too slowly under Barker, and the court can, you know, set its deadlines accordingly, can dismiss the case if it's already proceeded for too long a period of time.\n\nAnd we've also suggested that in this particular case where the claims really are just about timing, you know, Petitioners haven't alleged there wasn't due process to seize their vehicles, they haven't complained with the time—final proceeding, they concede in their reply that sometimes a final forfeiture hearing could happen quickly enough, that when the claim is really about timing, that there's going to be little difference between applying $8,850 or Barker to that type of claim.\n\nJudge: But I guess—\n\nJudge: You keep saying \"timely.\" I don't know what timely is. I have a brief that set out the fact that on some hearings by the nature of what the courts are doing are taking up to a year or more.\n\nI don't consider that timely if I'm an innocent owner who relies on my car for my survival. And there's evidence of claimants who, in fact, had children, who lost their job, et cetera.\n\nSo how do we take care of those things?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think if you're concerned about that sort of thing, the claimant can raise the concern that the proceedings are already taking too long in their ongoing forfeiture proceedings, or if the forfeiture proceedings haven't been filed, they can file a Rule 41[g] motion in the federal system or a Rule 313 motion in the Alabama system.\n\nSo there are ways to bring the timeliness claim up to a court without requiring a retention hearing in all cases. And I think one important thing to keep in mind, and, you know, Petitioner has focused extensively on the fact that there's an innocent owner defense at play here and that that somehow means that there's an earlier entitlement to a hearing.\n\nAnd Alabama law, the version of law that was in effect for this case, makes it clear that that is an affirmative defense.\n\nThat's in Wallace versus State, which—\n\nJudge: Is—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —is cited on page 3 of our brief.\n\nJudge: Is that part of its new law?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Excuse me?\n\nJudge: Is it part of the Alabama new law?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It is not, no, but the Alabama new law, of course, is not at issue in this case.\n\nAnd the version of the innocent owner defense that's at issue here only comes in after the state has made out its prima facie case—\n\nJudge: Quite interesting, isn't it, that once the incentive is taken out of police officers taking advantage of the system as it exists, that Alabama puts in a system that is much fairer?\n\nThat was one of the reasons that Alabama resisted granting cert in this case because the new system does look to guarantee a faster process?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think the new system's processes are different, but I think it's important to keep in mind that I don't even think the new system's process would have given these Petitioners faster process.\n\nSo the innocent owner defense under Alabama's new law, once an innocent owner seeks—seeks an innocent owner hearing, the state has up to 60 days to respond to that.\n\nAnd that's almost exactly the amount of time that Petitioners would have had their cars returned to them had they proceeded under Alabama state law as it had existed at the time of this case.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJustice Thomas, anything?\n\nJustice Alito?\n\nAnything further, Justice?\n\nJustice Kagan?\n\nJustice Gorsuch?\n\nJustice Jackson?\n\nJudge: Yeah, can I just clarify one thing? You—you say that you think that the only right is to a timely final forfeiture hearing, but I thought what was at issue in this case is the test that is to be used to make that determination.\n\nSo I appreciate that the government thinks it knows the answer in all of these cases, which is, you don't get a hearing. But I thought this—that the—I thought we had tests that we applied in the law to lead us to that conclusion in particular cases, depending upon the claims and the circumstances.\n\nAnd so our question was what test?\n\nAnd am I wrong? It—it—it feels to me strangely like the government has picked the answer and is choosing the test that will inevitably lead to the answer that the government wants, as opposed to telling us here is the difference between the Barker test and the Mathews test and which one is better in terms of a—more consistent with our prior case law, et cetera, et cetera?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think we view the answer to the question presented as being it doesn't matter because the Court has essentially already decided this in Von Neumann, in $8,850. And I—\n\nJudge: What's your—what is—what is your view of my thought that Von Neumann is really much narrower in the language that you're talking about than your—than the—than the way it is being read, that it's been taken out of context?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think Von Neumann, the latter part of that decision, I—I read it as having assumed that there was a due process right to a timely remission—adjudication of the remission petition.

{"id": "252", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWe'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-929, Velazquez versus Garland.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 60-day time period in the voluntary departure statute works like any routine legal time period.\n\nWhen the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the period continues to run until the next business day.\n\nCongress would have expected people to read the statute this way.\n\nIn 1996, common law principles, case law, established rules and regulations, and years of consistent practice all pointed to that interpretation.\n\nIf Congress had meant to deviate from that traditional understanding, it would have said so.\n\nEven the government now acknowledges that other deadlines in the same section of IIRIRA follow the traditional rule in light of a long-standing immigration regulation defining the word \"day.\" So the only way to adopt the government's interpretation is to believe that Congress used two different meanings of the word \"day\" in the same section of the same statute.\n\nThere's simply no indication that Congress took that kind of split approach.\n\nThe government's interpretation would also spell chaos for regulatory definitions and deadlines.\n\nIn the government's view, even though Section 1001.1(h) provides a single definition for the word \"day,\" that -- the immigration regulations actually use that term to mean different things throughout.\n\nAnd so the only way to tell which deadline follows which time calculation rule is to trace each deadline's history back through earlier and earlier versions of the code and Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nAnswering a question as simple as does my deadline fall on Saturday or Monday shouldn't depend on this kind of complex historical investigation, especially when deportation's on the line.\n\nThe default rule for weekends and holidays exists precisely to avoid this kind of case-by-case guesswork. The government identifies no reason and certainly no reason grounded in the text of the statute to depart from that traditional rule.\n\nThe Court should read Section 1229c like any other statute and follow the usual rule for weekends and holidays.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge:\n1252(a) speaks in terms of a removal -- final removal order.\n\nIs there one involved in this case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThere is, Your Honor. And I would make two points.\n\nFirst, as you point out, subsection (a)(1) speaks in terms of judicial review of a final order of removal.\n\nThat's exactly what we're seeking.\n\nIf we win in this case, the final order of removal that binds our client will say one thing.\n\nIf we lose, it will say another.\n\nAnd the second point is this Court has long recognized that BIA decisions on reopening and reconsideration are separate final orders that require a separate petition and are separately reviewable in the courts of appeals.\n\nJudge:\nIt seems that you're saying that a collateral consequence to a ruling on this is a part of the final order.\n\nHow is that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo the voluntary --\n\nJudge:\nThe order itself is not here, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI disagree, Your Honor, in two respects.\n\nSo, one, as I just pointed out, the Court has consistently explained that a reconsideration or reopening decision is --\n\nJudge:\nI thought we were talking about the 60 -- whether there are 60 days or 62 days to leave for -- voluntarily.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right, Your Honor.\n\nAnd the voluntary departure order at pages 42a and 43a of the Petition Appendix spell out the consequences if, on the one hand, our client files a timely motion to reopen or, on the other hand, if our client fails to depart the country or files an untimely motion.\n\nThere are two alternate orders of removal waiting in the wings, one with harsh penalties, one without, and this timeliness determination directly affects which of those alternate orders of removal will take effect.\n\nJudge:\nYou argue, and just did, that this is a very simple question. But a good part of your argument is taking regulatory provisions and applying them to the statute.\n\nYou say that that is the appropriate prism through which to read the statute.\n\nThe prism test doesn't sound very straightforward and clear to me.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWhat you have in this case is everything pointing in the same direction.\n\nSo start with the regulation. Section 1001.1 provides a definition of \"day\" that has governed since the creation of the INA and that remained unchanged for a decade before this particular provision passed.\n\nAnd the government even acknowledges now that other deadlines in the same section of IIRIRA follow that definition.\n\nSo somebody picking up the statute in 1996 would have read the statute in light of that definition.\n\nBut it's not just the regulation.\n\nAs we point out, that regulation codifies an earlier practice that's reflected in Civil Rule 6(a), which this Court and the BIA have looked to.\n\nThat rule itself codifies earlier decisions, like this Court's decision in Street, that recognized a general principle that when a power can be exercised up until a certain day, if that day is a Sunday or holiday, it can be exercised the next business day.\n\nAnd those decisions recognized an even -- or -- or encapsulated --\n\nJudge:\nThe --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n--an even --\n\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, go ahead.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nEncapsulated an even earlier common law principle.\n\nAnd so somebody reading this statute in '96 would have had no reason to deviate from all of those things, pointing to the same interpretation.\n\nJudge:\nBut your argument evolves, right? I mean, as I read your brief anyway, the Sunday provision was pretty clear early on, but then Saturday kind of crept in there somewhere along the way.\n\nAnd so, usually, we think of statutory -- timing deadlines as not sort of flexible in that way.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nTwo points, Your Honor. First, I would just return to the regulation and say that that definition, which was in place for years before this statute passed, encapsulated Saturday, and that's codified --\n\nJudge:\nRight, but we're talking about the statute, so --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight, and I think that regulation encapsulates an earlier principle that has not changed over time.\n\nSo the way I would frame the principle generally is that there are certain days, you can call them -- certain legally recognized days of rest.\n\nYou can call them non-business days.\n\nYou can use the Latin term dies non juridicus.\n\nThat principle recognizes that when a deadline or time period expires on one of those legally recognized days of rest, it carries over to the next day.\n\nBut the days that are legally recognized days of rest can change over time. And so, with respect to Saturday, of course, there was a change in the 20th century as Saturday came to be recognized as a day that's akin to Sunday, on par with Sunday. But the prin --- the underlying principle that --\n\nJudge:\nCounsel, why are you going so far? You don't need the common law.\n\nCommon law provides a background for what Congress was doing when it passed this law, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd your answer is that when a word comes with old soil, you transport the old soil.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nAnd the old soil here, even according to the government, was that \"day\" was defined according to the regulation.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "598", "dialogue": "Judge: Excuse me, may I ask one follow-up question on that? So I understand your answer to these hypotheticals is that we must look to Congress's historical practices. This is a matter of seeing whether the setup that we have before us is consistent with Congress's historical practices. Is that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We draw heavily on historical practices, also text—\n\nJudge: Is that—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —of course.\n\nJudge: Is that the test?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't want to lose sight of that.\n\nJudge: Is that the test? Is it the test?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that the test in this context, as in most separation of powers cases, is, yes, text and history. And here again, we have a specific constitutional provision speaking to duration, speaking to particular types of functions, showing that the Framers were concerned about funding the Army with a standing appropriation but didn't have that same concern or effort to restrict Congress's authority with respect to other functions. And then we have an unbroken line of history. There have been agencies funded this way for every year of this nation's history.\n\nJudge: Well, what is your best historical—your single best example of an agency that has all of the features that the opposing party has cited? Your single best example of an agency with that combination of features?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think our best example historically is the Customs Service. The first Congress created the Customs Service in 1789. It gave the Customs Service a standing, uncapped source of funding from the revenues that the Customs Service collected through things including coercive law enforcement activity, things like levying fines, also from import duties, which could not be avoided if you wanted to engage in trade with the new nation. And the Customs Service was one of the most powerful agencies that was originally created because it was so important to have a stream of funding for the new republic. So I think that if you look through all of the factors they're challenging here, we have the Customs Service and others—the revenue officers; U.S. Attorneys, for a period of time, were funded through conviction fees.\n\nJudge: What is your best example of an agency that draws its money from another agency that, in turn, does not get its money from a congressional appropriation in the normal sense of that term but gets it from the private sector?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I can't give you another example of a source that's precisely like that one, but I would dispute the premise that that could possibly be constitutionally relevant. This is a case about Congress's own prerogatives over the purse—its authority. And if Congress has given away too much of its authority by not providing for a durational limit or providing too much discretion to the agency, then I don't see how it could possibly fix the problem that other fee-funded agencies directly collect their money from the entities they regulate.\n\nJudge: So I take it your answer is that this is not consistent with any historical practice, but you think that to the extent it is unprecedented, it is unprecedented in a way that is not relevant for present purposes? Is that your answer?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, primarily. I think it would be unprecedented in the way that you could say this is the only agency that has the acronym CFPB. That's obviously true also, but it doesn't track the constitutional value. But I also just want to make the factual point that I don't understand them to be saying it's significant that it's structured this way in the abstract. They say what it means is that there's not a check on the overall amount of funding the CFPB could get, and there is a check on those other agencies. And that's wrong as a descriptive matter. There is no similar check on the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the NCUA, the FCA, or the FHFA.

{"id": "688", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 23-477, United States versus Skrmetti.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about access to medications that have been safely prescribed for decades to treat many conditions, including gender dysphoria.\n\nBut SB1 singles out and bans one particular use.\n\nIn Tennessee, these medications can't be prescribed to allow a minor to identify with or live as a gender inconsistent with the minor's sex.\n\nIt doesn't matter what parents decide is best for their children.\n\nIt doesn't matter what patients would choose for themselves.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter if doctors believe this treatment is essential for individual patients. SB1 categorically bans treatment when and only when it's inconsistent with the patient's birth sex.\n\nTennessee says that sweeping ban is justified to protect adolescent health.\n\nBut the State mainly argues that it had no obligation to justify the law and that SB1 should be upheld so long as it's not wholly irrational.\n\nThat's wrong.\n\nSB1 regulates by drawing sex-based lines and declares that those lines are designed to encourage minors to appreciate their sex.\n\nThe law restricts medical care only when provided to induce physical effects inconsistent with birth sex.\n\nSomeone assigned female at birth can't receive medication to live as a male, but someone assigned male can.\n\nIf you change the individual's sex, it changes the result.\n\nThat's a facial sex classification, full stop, and a law like that can't stand on bare rationality.\n\nTo be clear, states have leeway to regulate gender-affirming care, but, here, Tennessee made no attempt to tailor its law to its stated health concerns.\n\nRather than impose measured guardrails, SB1 bans the care outright no matter how critical it is for an individual patient, and that approach is a stark departure from the State's regulation of pediatric care in all other contexts.\n\nSB1 leaves the same medications and many others entirely unrestricted when used for any other purpose, even when those uses present similar risks.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether Tennessee could justify that sex-based line.\n\nBecause the Equal Protection Clause requires more, this Court should remand so that SB1 can be reviewed under the correct standard.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Much of your -- the latter part of your opening statement suggests that the -- well, seemed to suggest that there's an outright ban on this treatment.\n\nBut that's not the case.\n\nIt's really for minors.\n\nSo why isn't this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban, as you suggested in your opening statement?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It's certainly true, Justice, that the statute classifies based on age, but it packages that age classification with a sex restriction and says that for all adolescents, you cannot take these medications if they're inconsistent with your sex.\n\nSo I acknowledge that the State so far has not banned this care for adults, although I think that the arguments it's making that this isn't a sex-based line in the first place would equally apply in that context.\n\nBut the Court has likewise made clear that when you classify on the basis of multiple characteristics, you can't avoid heightened scrutiny just because you have a non-protected characteristic that accompanies the protected one.\n\nAnd if you look at it from the standpoint of the plaintiffs who are actually affected by this law, the reason I'm calling it a categorical ban is because the State has left no out for those patients to obtain these medications when there's a showing of individualized medical need, and that is, I think, a -- a stark departure from how the State ordinarily handles issues related to measuring risks and benefits even in the pediatric context.\n\nJudge: Well, is there no difference in the -- if a girl takes testosterone or if a boy takes testosterone?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the district court specifically considered this question in detail and found that with respect to the risks that the State had identified, it was not substantiated that there would be unique risks associated with --\n\nJudge: No.\n\nI --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- a cross-sex use of the hormones.\n\nJudge: Is there no physiological difference?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Certainly, I understand that there are biological differences between males and females, but when it came to the specific risk factors that the State was focused on, what the district court found is that many of those risk factors would exist regardless of the birth sex of --\n\nJudge: Well, I'm more --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- who was taking those medications.\n\nJudge: -- interested in whether or not there is a difference in testosterone and its reaction in a male as opposed to in a female --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So --\n\nJudge: -- and vice versa for estrogen.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, if you take hormones, they will prompt the development of secondary sex characteristics, and -- and whether you're a male or a female, if you take testosterone, you might develop a deeper voice register, you might have facial hair growth, and, in fact, that's one of the intended effects of these treatments because that can be critical to helping manage gender dysphoria that transgender adolescents would ever -- would otherwise experience.\n\nBut I think, when it comes to the question of whether that creates unique risks, the district court found that for the most part, the State had not substantiated those risks and that it leaves regulation of medication unrestricted even in contexts where these same medications or others would pose a comparable set of risks.\n\nJudge: Counsel --\n\nJudge: Counsel, you rely very heavily in your briefing on cases like Morales-Santana, which was about the distinctions between men and women when it came to adoption and things of that sort.\n\nHere, it seems to me that the medical issues are much more heavily involved than in many of the cases that you -- you look to, including -- I understand there's a dispute between both sides on how extensive any evolution or increase in uncertainty in Europe has been and elsewhere.\n\nAnd, of course, we are not the best situated to address issues like that, unlike in, you know, like Morales and Craig v. Boren and some of the other ones, where it doesn't strike me that they're intensely affected by medical considerations.\n\nAnd if that's true, doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So let me respond to that concern with a couple of different points, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nI certainly take the point that you might think that states should have a lot of leeway to regulate when it comes to medical uncertainty.\n\nAnd we're not arguing otherwise.\n\nIf the State is not restricting access to medications on the basis of a protected characteristic, that is only going to be rational basis review from the outset, and it's only in a circumstance where the State is saying your access to drugs depends on your birth sex or your sex generally that the Court would apply heightened scrutiny.\n\nBut, even at that stage, I don't think it's necessary for the Court to step in and suggest that states have no ability to draw those kinds of lines.\n\nAnd I think this relates to my point in colloquy with Justice Thomas as well.\n\nWe, of course, recognize that if there's a lot of medical uncertainty or differential risk, and if the State can actually come forward and show that it has an important reason to restrict access based on sex, that can be taken into account in heightened scrutiny, and it wouldn't provide a basis to displace the state legislatures altogether from weighing this evidence.\n\nBut I think it would be a pretty remarkable thing for the Court to say that just because we're in the space of medical regulation, you are not going to apply the traditional standards that ordinarily are applied when there's a sex classification.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "816", "dialogue": "Judge: All right. Finally, with respect to the previous question, I guess I'm wondering what, if anything, we can do about the oddity of the standard in this context. It's in the statute, and so I don't know whether we can just read the statute to say something other than it says because we think this is odd to have it here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I mean, you can—we certainly agree that you can read the statutory language in light of the relevant opinion because—both because the statute—\n\nJudge: The statute tells you you're supposed to do that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It did, both by drawing specific language from that opinion and by including a separate citation to it. But I don’t think the Court can get away from the fact that Congress chose this particular formulation as its distillation of that opinion.\n\nJudge: And that's because, as you said in the beginning, \"significantly affects\" means something, right? Congress could have used another formulation if it just wanted preemption regarding any law that relates to this, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It could have used—\n\nJudge: They say that in another statute, for example, where it says a law is preempted if it relates.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: And so that's easy to apply, but here, they didn't say that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. And sometimes some preemption provisions say a state can't enforce a law that is different from or in addition to the requirements of federal law, meaning a state can attach additional consequences to conduct that already violates federal law but can't go beyond that. And Congress didn’t choose anything like that here.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Counsel for the plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court. State law significantly interferes with the exercise of national banking powers in two respects. First, the law controls the interest rate on mortgage accounts. Second, a patchwork of 50 state laws would unduly burden national banks, destroying their uniform federal character.\n\nNow, the other side posits that \"significantly interferes\" requires factual proof that a state law would hinder a banking power to some unspecified degree. But \"significantly interferes\" can be both quantitative and qualitative. A state law that dictates the attributes of a banking product interferes with national banking power in a qualitative sense, just as courts telling prosecutors what charges to bring would significantly interfere with executive power.\n\nThe relevant opinion uses the term \"significantly interferes\" in a qualitative sense. That opinion reasons that state laws are preempted absent any indication that Congress intended to subject the banking power to local conditions. And here, we know Congress intended the opposite.\n\nFirst, federal law comprehensively regulates state mortgage escrow accounts in order to protect consumers without requiring any interest. And second, Congress speaks expressly when it contemplates state interest laws. It did so for state usury laws, and federal law itself requires interest on certain mortgage escrow loans but not those of the plaintiff.\n\nIt is unfathomable that Congress intended the other side’s test. They never told you what interest rate would be too much, what to do when market forces change, and how courts should proceed bank by bank. But national banks need to know their regulatory obligations ahead of time. It would create seismic uncertainty if the laws of 50 states could apply to every banking product and service—not just every feature of a mortgage but everything from interest rates on savings and checking accounts to ATM fees to credit card reward programs.\n\nCongress surely intended a preemption standard that preserves the stability and predictability that undergirds a safe and sound banking system. I welcome questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, do we treat express banking powers the same as incidental banking powers? It would seem that you would have to somehow have a way to fathom what these incidental powers are.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: No. There are enumerated powers in the statute, and incidental powers are defined as necessary powers to the business of banking. The only enumerated ones are basically lending money, taking deposits, and making real estate loans. What interest a bank charges is so fundamental to a banking product and the banking power that it would seem absurd to say a state could dictate the interest rate on something like a savings account just because that’s an incidental power.\n\nJudge: Well, I agree with you on that. In a prior case, I think it was statutory, right? It was express. But what I’m more interested in is the creation of an escrow account, then interest rate on the escrow account, which is not something a bank would normally have to do.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: That’s correct. Thirteen state laws require it. Since 1973, we’ve had federal regulations that never required interest. There are thousands of words of regulations and interpretive statements regulating escrow accounts under federal law, and none of it requires interest.\n\nThe other side would argue that states could now make amendments to every single one of those requirements, and banks would have to seek declaratory judgments on each and every requirement just for escrows. And when you extend that logic to everything a bank does, it becomes mind-boggling. National banks provide countless products and services.\n\nJudge: There are amici and the logic of the lower court ruling that suggest—and based on your test—that no state consumer law would be permitted. But there’s an express permission for state consumer laws. So which ones do you say are okay?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: The definition of a \"state consumer financial law\" versus the law that’s preempted under our test focuses on what is being controlled. It’s not simply about state regulation. The key question is: what is being controlled? Is it the national banking power, or is it the financial transaction with the consumer?\n\nJudge: I’m sorry, what’s not controlling the financial transaction with the consumer here?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Let me explain. When the state dictates the attribute of the product or service—as opposed to the interaction with the consumer—it is preempted. Under that definition, state laws prohibiting racial discrimination, fraud, or certain banking-specific rules are not preempted.\n\nFor example, in a key prior case, the Court ruled that a banking-specific law was not an unlawful encroachment on national banks' rights, nor did it interfere with an authorized function. The law merely changed the identity of the account holder with a lawful right to demand payment, without interfering with the banking power itself.\n\nOther categories of state consumer financial laws that are not preempted regulate the manner and terms of financial transactions with consumers. For instance, every state has laws regarding the age of majority for obtaining a mortgage—usually 18, but in some states, 21. States also have laws governing when the statute of frauds applies to contracts.\n\nJudge: But aren’t national banks interacting with consumers pursuant to their banking powers? Why don’t those two categories collapse?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: They don’t collapse because, since 1870, the Court has maintained that state contract and tort laws still apply to banks. There’s no federal common law of contracts or torts. So, in their daily lives, banks remain subject to state laws more than federal laws because states provide the underlying contract and tort law framework.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "395", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-3, Coinbase versus Suski. Counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Arbitration Act requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.\n\nRespondents and Coinbase agreed to arbitrate any disputes about Coinbase services and to delegate to an arbitrator any threshold disputes about whether specific claims were subject to arbitration.\n\nDespite this delegation clause, the parties have spent nearly three years disputing this threshold issue.\n\nThat's because, instead of enforcing the delegation clause, the courts below came up with rationales to evade it and to instead answer the question of arbitrability for themselves.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit did so by characterizing Respondents' challenge as one of contract formation, asserting that contract formation can never be delegated and sidestepping the delegation clause.\n\nThe issue, as the court of appeals saw it, was whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate these claims.\n\nIf that approach were correct, courts in every case could ignore delegation clauses by just characterizing an arbitrability dispute as a question of whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate the claims at issue.\n\nRespondents do not defend that reasoning. They agree the contracts here were formed and that they were in effect. Their argument is that the scope of the otherwise applicable arbitration agreement was narrowed by a later contract to exclude their asserted claims.\n\nThat question is one of arbitrability, and the parties agreed an arbitrator would decide it.\n\nRespondents blur three distinct legal questions in a case like this one.\n\nThe first is the merits of the claims the Respondents assert.\n\nThe second is whether the merits of those claims should be arbitrated.\n\nAnd the third, which is the only question that was before the courts below and is before this Court, is who decides whether the merits should be arbitrated.\n\nThis third question is antecedent to the other two.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Isn't the problem the confusion that results from the difference between the official rules and the agreement?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, at some level, there is some confusion that the Respondents have argued results from looking at these two together.\n\nBut the only way there is confusion is if you conflate those different layers of questions because the delegation clause that's in the arbitration agreement answers directly the who decides.\n\nJudge: So what is the source of the disagreement here? Doesn't it come from the rules?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Certainly.\n\nThe source of the disagreement is that there is a forum selection clause in the official rules that says something about controversies regarding the promotion.\n\nAnd the Respondents have argued that, by using that language, the second contract somehow carved out of the arbitration agreement the claims they want to assert here.\n\nJudge: Well, couldn't this have been solved in drafting by simply either having an express arbitration provision in the rules or by referring back to and incorporating the user agreement?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I think those are certainly questions that could be and should be addressed by the arbitrator when this gets there.\n\nBut the threshold question is whether the confusion that Your Honor is referencing has anything to do with the who decides issue.\n\nAnd there's nothing in the rules language --\n\nJudge: Well, I think it goes a little deeper because you can also say, is there actually an arbitration agreement that comes out of the rules?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I don't think there is an arbitration agreement anywhere in the official rules.\n\nThe Respondents' argument is to try to take the rules to create ambiguity about the -- or confusion, as Your Honor said, about what claims are actually subject to arbitration.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But that is a garden-variety arbitrability question.\n\nIt doesn't speak to the threshold, gateway who decides question.\n\nJudge: So can I ask you -- oh, go ahead.\n\nJudge: Can I ask you about the who decides question? Because I think I'm following your argument, but I guess I'm questioning whether you're right that the only way there is confusion is if you conflate the questions.\n\nSo let me posit this hypothetical.\n\nSuppose we have two contracts, the first of which has a delegation clause that answers the who decides question, and the answer in the first contract is the arbitrator decides.\n\nWe have a second contract that answers the delegation question, and the answer in that case is the court decides.\n\nIn that situation, where you have these two different contracts with two different clear delegation principles, isn't the question at that point which contract controls?\n\nWhich, you know, I take it is another way of the Ninth Circuit saying, well, this contract superseded that one.\n\nBut really, it's a question at that point of what did the parties intend, what was their agreement about which of these two contracts controls the situation.\n\nAnd in that case, I think you go to the court.\n\nWhy am I wrong about that? And isn't that the situation that's actually being presented on these facts?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think you are right about that, not wrong about it.\n\nAnd I think the distinction between your hypothetical and this issue in this case is a very important one.\n\nYou're right about it because, in your hypothetical, you identified a contract with a delegation clause and a second contract that isn't silent about delegation; it specifically addresses delegation and has a different provision.\n\nSo a party could come into court resisting arbitration and make a specific challenge to the delegation clause in the first contract that is directed at whether that particular delegation clause has been superseded by the later delegation clause.\n\nIt's all at this who decides level.\n\nThe problem in this case is that from the very beginning, the Respondents have agreed this arbitration agreement remains in effect.\n\nThis delegation clause remains in effect.\n\nIt would cover these claims.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That is a very different situation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Here, if someone has shelter—let’s say they were offered shelter yesterday and refused it—and then today, when they are told they are not permitted to camp, are they involuntarily there if they refused shelter the day before? That is a question the Eighth Amendment does not answer.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This is very complex.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: What if there is a bed available in the Gospel Rescue Mission, but like one of the plaintiffs, a person does not wish to leave their pet? Their Rottweiler is not permitted there. That is a difficult question for a person and a difficult policy question, but—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —a person's status—yes.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Justice, your question?\n\nJudge: Robinson actually included a crime of either using narcotics or being addicted to the use of narcotics, and the Court was concerned about the status of being addicted to the use.\n\nJudge: Is there a crime here for being homeless?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, there is not.\n\nJudge: Another Justice, your question?\n\nJudge: Robinson presents a very difficult conceptual question.\n\nJudge: Do you think that all people who are drug addicts are absolutely incapable of refraining from using drugs?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that for some, that may be true, and for others, perhaps they can abstain. But that is a question of free will and agency, which is true of every law and what conduct we choose to regulate.\n\nJudge: All right. Then compare that with a person who absolutely has no place to sleep in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: Does that person have any alternative other than sleeping outside?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think we would have to ask all the questions I mentioned earlier about what alternatives they might have had yesterday—\n\nJudge: They have none. They have absolutely none.\n\nJudge: There is not a single place where they can sleep.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If that is true, then that may be the case. And in that case, at least in Oregon, they would have a defense of necessity.\n\nJudge: So the point is that the connection between drug addiction and drug usage is more tenuous than the connection between absolute homelessness and sleeping outside.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think, in Robinson, the Court drew that line. But here, the plaintiffs are saying the two are the same—that camping outside, sleeping outside, and being homeless are two sides of the same coin. We think that is wrong.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is collapsing the status that they claim into conduct.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The conduct here is very clear because it applies generally to everyone.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The law does not say on its face that it is a crime to be homeless. I just want to—\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —make that very clear.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Another Justice, your question?\n\nJudge: It was the brief of Criminal Law and Punishment Scholars that I was referencing earlier.\n\nJudge: I want to go back to an earlier question.\n\nJudge: As I understood it, the Ninth Circuit never reached the excessive fines question presented by this case, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct.\n\nJudge: So that is still open.\n\nJudge: And you did not seek certiorari on that issue?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nJudge: Assuming that there is no standing, I understand one of the plaintiffs died during the pendency of this appeal.\n\nJudge: And there are two other named plaintiffs. I know they have fines on them, but I am not sure that either of them has any criminal charges against them.\n\nJudge: Where does that put this appeal? Where does that put this case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the case—\n\nJudge: Should we be vacating and remanding to see if there is a named plaintiff who is still suffering injury?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Here, the sleeping ordinance, which was challenged, is no longer in the case. That ordinance limited sleeping in certain rights-of-way and sidewalks in the city, and that is not at issue here.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So sleeping is not at issue. It is about the camping ordinance.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And we very much have a live case because we are under the Ninth Circuit’s injunction, and the named plaintiffs—\n\nJudge: No, the question is whether the injunction could be given.\n\nJudge: Are these people—\n\nJudge: Well, I guess, if they are not permitted to park—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is correct.\n\nJudge: So it is not the camping, it is the parking, is it not?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, and the camping. We intend to rely on these laws. They are very important—\n\nJudge: You are not answering. Just focus on my question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Both these people sleep in cars.\n\nJudge: Both of them sleep in cars outside of the town.\n\nJudge: So they are not seeking camping permission.\n\nJudge: Does your city not provide for overnight parking in any location at night except in private homes?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Camping in a vehicle is included in the camping ordinance.\n\nJudge: Well, that is going into a camp.\n\nJudge: How do you define \"camp\"?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is a place where someone has laid down without any more, has—\n\nJudge: So if there is a line of cars, and the cars can stay overnight—\n\nJudge: And they want to park in one of those spaces—\n\nJudge: If they fall asleep in the car, are they guilty of violating the camping law?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: One of the plaintiffs parks her car oftentimes at a friend’s, so she is not violating the law at those times.\n\nJudge: Just answer my question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Parking everywhere is not prohibited.

And that goes to the concerns Justice Jackson was talking about, which is this repose that the federal statute bakes into it.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nJudge: And, as a practical matter, is that what 544(b) gets you that you don't get under 548, that, you know, the two-year statute of limitation and the -- in 548 versus some state -- states have longer lookback periods?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's exactly right.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: In most situations, the terms of 548 are basically very similar to the terms in the state law and the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and its successors.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: You're basically looking for whether a transfer was given for a reasonably equivalent value and whether the debtor was insolvent.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And those terms are essentially very similar in 548 and in the state laws being incorporated through 544(b), but, as you say, several states -- many states have adopted longer lookback periods or longer limitations periods, four years or even six years.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So that would be why the trustee is using 544(b).\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The trustee can do so if an actual creditor could have done so outside of bankruptcy because that transfer was vulnerable, but he can't do so where no actual creditor already had that right.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Then he's stuck with 548 and he would be stuck with 548 in this case.\n\nJudge: I mean, just taking a step back, there is something a little bit peculiar about the argument, right, saying 106 waives sovereign immunity and what happens as a result of that is you can hale the trustee into court, and then the trustee gets to court and it turns out he always loses.\n\nJudge: So what was the point of the thing?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Sure.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So two points on that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: On the first point, he loses because of the nature of 544(b) because of the merits. I understand your --\n\nJudge: I get that.\n\nJudge: It's just like, why does that matter to him or why would it have mattered to Congress, more to the point? Like, why would Congress have gone to this trouble of waiving sovereign immunity if the trustee was always going to lose anyway as a result of the substantive question in the suit?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So this goes to my second point.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: 106(a) is not a waiver about 544(b).\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: 106(a) waives immunity with respect to 59 code provisions.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It is a general waiver.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Do you think you would have the same argument if it was just a 544 waiver?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think this would be a much harder case if it was just a 544(b) waiver. I don't think it would be a hard case if it was a 544 waiver because of the work that it does in 544(a).\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think, if you had the same waiver written with respect only to 544(b), you would have this question as to why Congress wrote a waiver that doesn't have practical effect as to the federal government.\n\nJudge: I mean, but, if I understand the argument that you're making, you're saying, well, because Congress included so many things, we don't have to take any one of them particularly seriously.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That is not at all our position.\n\nJudge: Because it doesn't sound all that good.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's -- so that is not our position, and let me explain why. First of all, 106(a) identifies each of the 59 provisions not by subsection but by section.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So it has to have meaningful effect as to each section, and it certainly does have meaningful effect as to 544(a).\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: When Congress was identifying sections for which the waiver of immunity would operate, of course, it would include Section 544.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But I think it is also crystal-clear that Congress would not have thought that that waiver of immunity would expose the IRS to substantive state liability under 544(b), and that's because Congress specifically said in the waiver that nothing in this section creates any substantive claim for relief that doesn't otherwise exist.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And everyone has always known that the way 544(b) operates is only by pulling in existing state law liability, and everyone knows that the IRS is not subject to existing state law liability.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, when Congress wrote -- wrote a waiver that included 544, I think it is very clear that Congress did not think that that waiver would have the effect of altering substantive liability as to IRS that could never exist outside of bankruptcy.\n\nJudge: On -- on what Congress might have been thinking, the other -- the other side says that your position will create a playbook for fraud, that you pay your personal tax debts with corporate funds and let the IRS then, in their words, hide behind sovereign immunity that would short-change creditors.\n\nJudge: I just want to make sure you respond to that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thanks.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I appreciate the opportunity to do that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think that argument and those considerations cut the opposite direction.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The trustee's position here would allow these insiders, the wrongdoers here, to go free.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: In his world, he recovers this --this money from the IRS.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: He then cannot go after the insiders because he's entitled to only a single satisfaction under the bankruptcy's provision -- Bankruptcy Code's provision.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Meanwhile, we can't go after the insiders either because the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And that will be ever more likely when you're using a longer limitations period to go after these transfers.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: By contrast, under our view of the world and how this is supposed to work, when you're outside the lookback period, you should be going after the insiders.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And you have claims to do that because they are the wrongdoers here.\n\nJudge: Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito? Justice Gorsuch?\n\nJudge: One quick question. Let's suppose that the money didn't go to the U.S. Government but to a private party.\n\nJudge: Along the way, the trustee, in your view, could recover for that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If there was an action against the private party.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Obviously, private parties also have defenses.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Let's assume, instead of the United States here, it was a bank and the bank took in good faith for a mortgage that it was owed, then you wouldn't have a claim against the bank.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: You might have a claim against an insider that arranged that for some benefit --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- to himself, and you would be limited --\n\nJudge: That's what I'm talking about.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- in bankruptcy.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJust a few quick points. First, I don't think you heard a persuasive answer to why the Court shouldn't resolve this case on the narrow theory.\n\nAnd I think we agree with the United States that's the most straightforward way to do it.\n\nAnd I think the colloquy with Justice Kagan and Justice Alito shows that it's indisputable that she was a qualified individual subject to an allegedly discriminatory policy that reduced her compensation.\n\nThe ADA allows her to challenge that policy even after she leaves the job.\n\nAnd that answers the question and resolves at least a chunk of the circuit split.\n\nBut the second point I want to make is I think, while the case can be resolved on that narrow ground, I do want to urge the Court in its opinion to be careful not to foreclose other scenarios that the City's reading would permit, particularly given the City's failure to identify any plausible reason why Congress would have wanted to draw this arbitrary line.\n\nA firefighter who becomes disabled saving people from a burning building could be discriminated against the next month.\n\nA retired firefighter who develops a respiratory condition from years of smoke exposure could lose health coverage.\n\nAnd an employer could deny privileges that are extended to all other former employees, such as use of the company cafeteria or the attendance at a company retreat, based solely on disability-based animus. And the third and final point I want to make is just on the broader question.\n\nThe City's position creates fundamental anomalies that Congress couldn't have intended.\n\nThe City concedes that the ADA protects retirement benefits but offers no coherent account of how that protection could be vindicated, as I think the questions with Justice Jackson showed.\n\nThe City's extreme position creates perverse incentives for employers to hide discrimination until after retirement, and it would transform clearly unlawful discrimination into perfectly lawful conduct based solely on timing even though Congress expressly protected these benefits and included a safe harbor provision to address legitimate cost concerns.\n\nFor race or religion, we would never tolerate a regime under which unlawful discrimination suddenly becomes lawful a minute later.\n\nThe City can't explain why Congress would have created such an arbitrary line for disability discrimination alone.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "562", "dialogue": "Judge: What if the other charges on which there was probable cause were also felonies and maybe even more serious felonies than the so-called money-laundering charge? Would you make the same argument?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I don't think we'd be able to make the same argument about why we win under the United States' rule. But I think that the Eleventh Circuit—\n\nJudge: But you think you should win anyway?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think under the Eleventh Circuit's rule that the defense holds. And you can imagine, right—\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I mean, let's say some of them are—\n\nJudge: I mean, why? What if one of the charges is murder and there's probable cause to support the murder charge and then they throw in this money-laundering charge? Or let's say it's an assault, and let's say there's a video when the legitimate owners of the ring came to the store and they were causing a fuss and your client pulled out a gun and he said, \"Get out of my store, I'm going to blow your head off?\" So he's charged with an assault as well as money laundering. The same result?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So just as a preface, I think that this is the reason you should let these rules percolate, right? We should make—we should figure out how these rules actually play out in practice. The reason I think it's the same result, what the Williams Court would say, is there's a reason police officers lied about this charge, right, and so we're going to assume that they lied about it in part because they needed it to be able to detain the person.\n\nJudge: Well, that—I mean, you may be—this is—the facts of this case are disturbing, and you may well win. But we're talking about what the general rule should be. So your rule would apply in a case where the police officers act in good faith, but they just don't have probable cause? It's not limited to a case in which there was perjury or the manufacture of false evidence, right? Your rule is not limited in that way?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So that's correct, but we think another element, right, the mens rea element, which this Court hasn't weighed in on yet and on which there's a circuit split, is the proper element to do the filtering that Your Honor is talking about. And the reason why I think the more serious/less serious charge rule—so, to be clear, I think that's a rule we could certainly live with. We win under that rule. There's some evidence in the common law, the Newell Treatise, for instance, seems to suggest that the charge lacking probable cause should be the more serious charge, so we think there's some warrant for it, but the reason we don't think it's the best option is because you can imagine a situation, for instance, where the felony charge is a white-collar offense on which, you know, no one's ever going to be detained. The misdemeanor is a resisting arrest charge that—and the magistrate says, you know, that indicates some kind of dangerousness, that's the reason I'm going to detain him. And so I don't think you can have a kind of categorical more serious/less serious charge rule.\n\nAnd, again, I think what the Eleventh Circuit's rule does is it says: Look, at the point where this legal process has been tainted, remember, this Court's cases like Gerstein and County of Riverside say, if there was no legal process, right, if there's no arrest or Gerstein hearing, we actually don't care if there's all the probable cause in the world.\n\nJudge: Well, you're talking about being tainted. Now you're—then you're back to the idea that the officer lied, right? But what if he hadn't? I mean, what if there's just a—you know, there's no indication that there was a—that there's a lie, there just wasn't probable cause.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor. So I think, in that circumstance, first, probable cause, remember, is a low bar, right? It's just a reasonable belief. And, second, qualified immunity will almost certainly protect the officer in a situation where there's no probable cause, but even the judge is confused and thinks there's probable cause.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Well, it'll protect the officer, but it won't protect the municipality.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's true, Your Honor. But I'm having trouble thinking of a situation where a judge signs this thing, right, signs the arrest warrant, signs off on the Gerstein hearing, knowing all the facts the police officer accurately reported and yet there's not even probable cause.\n\nJudge: Can I ask you a question about the Eleventh Circuit rule? I just want to make sure I'm understanding it. I had thought that one distinction—and maybe it doesn't matter, and so you can tell me if it does—is that in Williams, the crime for which he was being detained and for which probable cause had been manufactured was the tainted crime, and the other crime for which there would have been probable cause if a warrant had been pursued was the one that had not had the adequate process. And that's a different situation than we have here, right? Because here, there was a valid warrant for the misdemeanors, right? It was just the money laundering. And so you actually had that process observed for the two misdemeanors in a way that in Williams, it was kind of like, it was blank, right, on the other side, and so there was no valid process holding him.\n\nDoes that—why does that not matter? I gather you think it doesn't.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I don't think it does because Williams is very clear. This is at 1165 that Williams will prevail if he establishes a genuine dispute about whether at least one of the two charges against him for attempted murder, right, so, remember, there's attempted murder as to two different officers.\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The holding is he only has to prove that one of those lacks probable cause. This is at 1165. So it's true that in Williams, there was also this uncharged offense, but Williams just says you have to prove one of the two charges in the actual arrest warrant was bogus.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then I want to understand a distinction, or what I think is a distinction, between your position and, say, the government's. Do you agree that you have to show a seizure for purposes of making out your claim?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we—we agree that you could just continue to reiterate the Thompson language, which is \"resulted in a seizure.\" We don't think this Court should use this case to go further and say that there cannot be a malicious prosecution claim predicated on, for instance, the unreasonable search clause or the warrant clause. We don't think that this is the case that tees that up.\n\nJudge: Well, the search clause, sure, but, I mean, is it going farther? We've said that before. I mean, you have to make out a Fourth Amendment claim. And here, your claim is for seizure of the person. You didn't make, I don't think, a separate claim about the seizure of his effects being unreasonable?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So—so, below, we did argue at the seizure of his effects as well as about the unreasonable search. What's come before this Court is—\n\nJudge: The Court is just this one.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And so—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —all we're saying is that you shouldn't—and I think we agree with the government on this.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You shouldn't reach out and affirmatively say there can be no other Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Do you have anything to say about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think, if it's going before a jury, subject to the rules of evidence, which, admittedly, I'm not an expert on, I think anything that's admissible and relevant I would think would be able to be used to prove this question to a jury.\n\nJudge: But it would make it harder since they don't apply to a judge, and a judge has to find these things by a preponderance if you're right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that it probably—I'm sure the standard would make it harder for them to prove these issues. Again, I don't think it—I agree with the government that I don't think this is going to matter in all that many cases because I think most of these cases are going to be pretty clear that the crimes were on separate occasions.\n\nThis case, for example, I think it's clear beyond a doubt, as the government said, that these crimes occurred multiple days apart. They were on separate occasions. And I think most juries—I guess the one point I would make is there is a potential nullification risk, I think, in some of these cases because of the severe mandatory minimums at issue.\n\nAnd I think the Petitioner cited one case in his cert petition where a Georgia jury refused to find different occasions despite the convictions being—or the offenses being—months and years apart.\n\nSo I do think that might happen in some cases, but for the most part, I think these are going to be pretty straightforward.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

I don't want to wade into that debate.\n\nJudge: No, I'm not suggesting we do. But it is an open question.\n\nJudge: Anything further? No? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Fisher.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you. I'd like to cover two topics.\n\nFirst, a couple more words about bifurcation. There was some talk about state practices. Even in 1967, when the Court looked at this issue in Spencer, it noted that the majority of the states require bifurcation by statute.\n\nIt's not even a prosecutorial discretion, discretionary decision. And I think that trend has continued for all the common-sense reasons laid out in the briefs you have.\n\nSo, Justice, it's not even a constitutional question necessarily. It's just already been decided by the states.\n\nIf you had—you know, this is a federal case where you have your own supervisory powers and you can, I think, you know, make whatever suggestions you like in the opinion, and we think it would be appropriate for the Court to say that bifurcation is the accepted solution here that seems to be the right one.\n\nI'd also like to say a couple words about the harmless error conversation that has taken place today.\n\nWe haven't briefed that issue precisely because the Court's common practice—and overwhelming practice—is to leave decisions like that, that were not addressed by the lower courts, for the lower courts to decide in the first instance.\n\nAnd that's what we'd ask for the Court to do here. And forgive me, I may have even misunderstood the way the amicus appointment works in this case.\n\nYou know, of course, we are not in line with the government on harmless error in this case, but the government's top-side brief said the case should be remanded for harmless error.\n\nAnd so, on the issue on which we are adverse to the government, you know, I don't know that amicus can come in and tell this Court to go ahead and address it.\n\nBut leaving that perhaps thorny issue of the Court's practice aside, in all events, we think the safest thing is to leave that for remand.\n\nBut I'll just add a couple of things about the factual conversation that took place today.\n\nRemember, when you ask whether these crimes that are alleged to be committed on an eight-day stretch, three different crimes on an eight-day stretch, could possibly be the same occasion, you are yourselves relying on these kinds of documents that you have noted in Mathis and Descamps are highly unreliable.\n\nAnd, in fact, these documents themselves, the plea documents themselves here say that Mr. Erlinger agrees to cooperate against all of his co-defendants.\n\nThere were no co-defendants in these cases.\n\nAnd so, Justice, you noted that an indictment might say \"on or about\" certain days. And when you get into an eight-day stretch, \"on or about\" matters quite a lot.\n\nSo what we would say on remand in part—and this goes to Justice Gorsuch's questions about how harmless error would work here—is that the government may not have been able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that these crimes were committed on separate occasions, and that's enough to allow a retrial or just at least renegotiations on that point.\n\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll submit.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Mr. Harper, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.\n\nYou have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful.\n\nThe case is submitted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

The Court most recently in City of Austin said you only have a content-based law when Congress is setting out to discriminate against particular subject matters or particular viewpoints.\n\nSo it's not enough that the law is -- is regulating in the space that involves content in some way.\n\nYou have to have this motive by Congress to actually want to suppress speech on certain topics or certain viewpoints.\n\nHere, Congress just wants to cut the PRC out of the equation altogether, and all of the same speech could continue to happen on the platform.\n\nIt's like patching up a backdoor vulnerability that the PRC has that we can't totally see around all the corners to imagine how it could use it against our interests, but we know the PRC will do whatever it can to try.\n\nAnd I think that is different in kind from imputing to Congress some motive to specifically get more speech on certain topics or with certain viewpoints.\n\nYou know, this law was passed by broad bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress, and our legislators don't always agree on everything.\n\nI think it's unlikely that all of them had exactly the same views about what's good content on TikTok or what are good viewpoints.\n\nThey weren't united on that.\n\nWhat they were united around was the idea that it is a grave threat to our nation if the PRC can itself behind the scenes be controlling how this platform operates.\n\nJudge:\n\nWhy doesn't this -- why doesn't this Act classify on the basis of speaker?\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nI do think that when it comes to the PRC and ByteDance, you could treat this as a speaker-based restriction.\n\nJudge:\n\nAnd aren't speech -- speaker-based restrictions almost always viewpoint-based restrictions, content-based restrictions?\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nThe Court has said it depends.\n\nIt hasn't applied an inflexible rule that anytime you are regulating certain speakers you are invariably regulating based on content.\n\nInstead, the Court has said it warrants closer consideration.\n\nAnd, here, if you look at the U.S. speakers, TikTok U.S. and the users, none of them are being regulated in a way that suggests its disagreement with their content.\n\nIt's all about what our foreign adversary is doing with respect to the platform.\n\nJudge:\n\nIt's hard for me to -- it's hard for me to think of situations, maybe they exist, where a classification based on speaker is not viewpoint-or content-based restrictions.\n\nI mean, somebody says Joe can't talk anymore.\n\nWe're going to shut Joe up.\n\nAnd we don't know what he's going to say tomorrow or two weeks from now.\n\nWe don't know what he's going to discuss.\n\nBut whatever he says is bad because Joe is a bad person.\n\nI mean, that's --that's viewpoint- and content-based, isn't it?\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nI think, when it comes to a foreign adversary, it's not right to view it that way, and the reason for that again is this is a sophisticated adversary nation, and we can't just simplistically say: Oh, what the PRC is going to want is to see more pro-China content on this app.\n\nAs Chief Judge Srinivasan observed, there are various ways that the PRC could try to create some kind of false flag operation and actually promote anti-China content, not to dictate how Americans should think about things but simply to create some trumped-up justification for a military or economic action that the foreign adversary wants to take against us.\n\nAnd I don't think a concern with trying to ward off that capability --\n\nJudge:\n\nWhy --why isn't that --why isn't that viewpoint or content still? We don't know what the content's going to be, but we know Joe is bad.\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nBecause I think the better classification is to recognize that what we're trying to prevent is not the specific subject matter, the specific viewpoints, but the technical capability of a foreign adversary nation to use a communications channel against this.\n\nJudge:\n\nI guess I'm just struggling how covert content manipulation isn't content-based restriction.\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nSo, again, it's because --\n\nJudge:\n\nI mean, the word -- it's kind of hard to avoid the word \"content\" --\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nI don't --\n\nJudge:\n\n-- and it's kind of hard to avoid the word \"viewpoint\" here, isn't it?\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nI don't dispute that it's related to content, but I don't think it reflects Congress seeking to set out in advance what kind of speech we should have reflecting certain views on certain topics.\n\nInstead, it's about trying to close off a vulnerability that our foreign adversary nation could exploit.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "935", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 22-846, Department of Agriculture Rural Development Rural Housing Service versus Kirtz.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The question in this case is whether Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign immunity of the United States when it amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide that any person who violates FCRA's requirements is liable for money damages.\n\nThe answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.\n\nInstead, Respondent is asking this Court to read an unwritten waiver into the statute on the theory that every time Congress creates a cause of action that applies to both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign immunity.\n\nBut that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.\n\nThis Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.\n\nBut there's nothing like that here. And as the Court's decision in Employees shows, the mere use of a general term defined elsewhere in the statute isn't enough to eliminate the sovereign immunity defense.\n\nSecond, it's in any event far from clear that these causes of action apply to the United States at all. Even the court of appeals recognized that FCRA's criminal provision uses \"person\" in a sense that does not include federal agencies, and it's plausible to interpret the nearby civil causes of action in the same way.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Putting aside sovereign immunity, the statute refers to -- defines a person as any individual, et cetera, and any government or governmental subdivision or agency. Putting aside the issue of sovereign immunity, wouldn't that suggest that it applies to the U.S. Government?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So we accept that that's a plausible reading.\n\nJudge: So, if it does that as explicitly as it does, isn't that sufficient to waive sovereign immunity?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So -- so two answers to that. We don't think that it unambiguously covers the United States. And I'd say our argument on that front is under the Court's decision in Utility Air.\n\nYou're asking, even if I assume that 1681n and o use \"person\" in a sense that does cover the United States, does that also take the analytically distinct step of waiving sovereign immunity?\n\nOn that argument, we would say no because all the text of the statute does is create a cause of action and it does so using a general word that, on hypothesis, covers both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants. But there's nothing necessarily implicit in that to show that Congress must have intended to waive the defenses that all defendants covered by that cause of action would have available under ordinary background principles.\n\nSo I don't think anyone would think it's strange, for example, if a defendant who's covered by the plain text of the cause of action but who violated FCRA more than five years ago were to assert a statute of limitations defense. That doesn't negate anything in the cause of action.\n\nAnd similarly here, the fact that, again, on hypothesis, some defendants covered by the cause of action would be able to assert a sovereign immunity defense doesn't negate anything in the statutory language that Congress used in adopting that cause of action.\n\nJudge: I'm not sure I understand that. I mean, suppose that we just take the definition and we plug it into n and o. What would your answer be then?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, if the Court were to plug all of the words from the definition into n and o specifically, then the only purpose of those words in n and o, the words referring to governmental entities, would be to make clear that Congress is authorizing recovery against sovereign defendants.\n\nJudge: So your answer then would be that there is not sovereign immunity?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. Our answer would be that even though Congress has not directly addressed sovereign immunity, unless --\n\nJudge: Yeah, I mean, it falls into the whole line of cases where Congress has authorized a cause of action against the government, and we say, well, that's inconsistent with the recognition of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity would negate the very cause of action that Congress has created, right? Those are the line of cases that we discussed just last year.\n\nAnd what you're saying to me is, yes, if you plug the definition into n and o, the liability provisions, those cases would -- you know, the same answer would follow?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, that's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then why does it make a difference that they're not plugged in to n and o but instead -- you know, the definition has a lot, a lot, a lot of words, right? There's a person, there's a corporation, there's an association, there's an enterprise, et cetera, et cetera. You can see why Congress didn't want to say that every time Congress meant to refer to a lot of different entities.\n\nSo -- but, you know, it's statutory interpretation 101 that we take a defined term, we plug the definition in, and that's what the meaning of the statute is. So that's what the meaning of the statute is.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, if the question here were just what the meaning of the words in the cause of action were, I -- I would agree with you.\n\nBut, here, you're not asking just what do the words mean; you're asking about the necessary logical implication of what Congress has done.\n\nJudge: Well, the necessary logical implication of what Congress has done is authorize a suit against people, persons, as defined in the definitions section. Then you go to the definitions section, and then you discover that what Congress has done is authorize a suit against natural persons, enterprises, and governments.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, respectfully, I don't think that's right. At the time that Congress adopted that definition, the one thing we know is that it wasn't doing so for purposes of allowing civil recovery against everyone covered by \"persons\" because the statute didn't authorize recovery against persons at the time.\n\nJudge: Right, but then there was the amendment. So why can't we assume from that that Congress was trying to reach all of the defined entities?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- so I think maybe that would be a plausible reading of the statute, but in order to find a waiver of sovereign immunity, you have to conclude that it's the only plausible reading of the statute.\n\nJudge: And why isn't it the only plausible -- I mean, Congress amended the statute clearly to expand liability. Do you concede that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, we agree with that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Will this declaration stop you tomorrow from putting him on the list for doing a fundraiser for that mosque?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I'll answer you directly, but I need to -- I feel compelled to, despite the premise --\n\nJudge: All of the facts are the same.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We -- we --\n\nJudge: Just answer the question.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No Fly List determinations are not made with respect to any particular event, conduct, anything. They are always based on a totality of the information.\n\nJudge: So answer the question. Can you put him on the list for doing the fundraiser the next day for the same mosque?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: By hypothesis, if your suggestion is that somehow the fundraiser is to fund terrorism -- I mean, I -- I -- I -- I don't want to jump into a hypothetical where --\n\nJudge: That's the -- that's the point, isn't it?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Huh?\n\nJudge: That without a declaration that basically says, for this activity, whatever that might be, we're not going to put him on the No Fly List, then how is the case mooted?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I don't think activity is the right unit of analysis. When you're trying to decide whether something is moot --\n\nJudge: Well, but the charge is terrorism activity or the threat thereof. So it's all about activity.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. But it's based on a totality of information, and the standard is poses a threat of conducting in or engaging one of four enumerated acts of terrorism. I don't think it's reasonable to expect that someone will engage in those acts. And what Respondent has is a declaration saying, as of this date or when you were taken off the list, you were taken off not as a matter of grace, not because we think you belong on the list but we're just taking you off anyway, but was taken off because he did not satisfy the criteria.\n\nJudge: Well, Mr. Lawyer -- I'm sorry. Finish your sentence. I -- I do find this a very perplexing case because you -- you have to show, in order to establish that the case is moot, that putting it in maybe simpler terms than we have used in our opinions, it's very unlikely or maybe very, very unlikely that he will again be put on the No Fly List. Do you agree with that?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think the language is reasonable expectation of recurrence.\n\nJudge: Well, it's a strange formulation where it says that you have to be absolutely certain that there's not a reasonable expectation. I don't really know how to put --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: -- those two things together, but let's just say it's some degree of unlikelihood, okay? It's hard to say how -- hard to tell how you can prove that without -- convince us of that without knowing why he was put on in the first place and why he was taken off. It's a -- you know, as you say, it's based on the totality of the circumstances. So there is the possibility that any additional relevant circumstance could be just the thing that tips the balance and he could be put back on.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven that it's very unlikely that you'll be put back on, but once you get back in district court, you're not going to be able to prove that you have standing for purposes of injunctive relief because your -- your -- your claim that you're going to be -- you may be put back on is entirely speculative. So, anyway, that's why I find it perplexing.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I -- I take the point. So let me try and address both pieces of that. First, as to, you know, the probability of recurrence or whatever, yes, it is our burden. We -- we agree with that. We acknowledge that. I guess what I would say is I would fall back on the fact that the standard is poses a threat of engaging in one of four enumerated acts of terrorism, that this is a U.S. person who's the plaintiff. And I would fall back on this Court's case law such as Lyons saying that for Article III purposes, it is unreasonable to expect a plaintiff to engage in illegal conduct again. And in the case of Lyons, even to simply be arrested by LAPD again, that was unreasonable to expect. If that's true for Article III purposes, I think you should be just as hesitant to expect a U.S. person to engage or to pose a threat of engaging in one of the four enumerated acts of terrorism.\n\nJudge: How can someone tell you that they're not going to engage in a terrorist activity if they don't know what terrorist activity it is that you claim they did? How can I reasonably be expected to say I'm not going to do X when I don't know what X is?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Again, it's -- I don't think it's reasonable to expect anyone to pose a threat of engaging in international terrorism in that --\n\nJudge: I mean, Mr. Lawyer, you're -- you're -- you're arguing the merits of the case. You obviously think that you have good reasons for putting people on the list. And, you know, on the other hand, the -- the suit, the whole gravamen of the complaint, is that you were not using good reasons. And we can't decide the merits of the case. I think that Justice's hypothetical is an extremely important one because it really asks, what does this declaration commit you to? The declaration clearly says that you can't use any facts that you know of now, so any facts that have happened in the past cannot be used to -- to relist the plaintiff. But the question that she's asking is, if he does the same kinds of things, if he meets with the same kinds of people, if he associates with the same kinds of organizations, can those same kinds of activities that put him on the list before put him on the list again? And I do think that you have to give a kind of yes-or-no answer to that question so that we can figure out what this declaration does and does not commit you to.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah. So, if you want a yes-or-no answer, my answer is yes because --\n\nJudge: Yes what?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes --\n\nJudge: He can go back on?\n\nJudge: Yes, you can put him back on --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "527", "dialogue": "Judge:\nCan states make a different choice if doing so means that a state's law operates to treat its citizens differently on the basis of -- name the suspect classification.\n\nI thought that was the work of the Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, we don't think that it draws any lines based off any suspect classes.\n\nJudge:\nNo, I understand. I'm not talking about this law.\n\nI'm going back to the suggestion that the Constitution doesn't play a role if the state is making a policy choice regarding issues such as these.\n\nAnd I'm -- I guess I'm still seeing a role for the Constitution in circumstances in which the claim that is being made is that the state's choices are implicating the equal protection rights of its citizens.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYour Honor, I think the -- I think the point -- I don't want to misstate the point, but I think the point is that the -- the Constitution is neutral in the sense that it does not provide heightened protection based on any suspect classification, and, thus, rational basis review applies in the presumption of legislative validity and the presumption that these types of policy choices are best left to the democratic process.\n\nI -- I think that is exactly what -- the correct way to think about this case.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nRebuttal?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nTwo quick clarifying points. I want to make clear that Tennessee here is not regulating based on off-label use. Off-label use is extremely common in pediatrics, and we pointed to a number of uses of these medications on page 40 of our brief, the very same medications that likewise are off-label use.\n\nIf there are problems with safety and effect -- and effectiveness, then that would not become the standard of care, and there are self-regulatory measures to address that issue. You said this might be a space where each state can make its own choice, but I think it's important to recognize that my friend's arguments would equally apply to a nationwide ban if this were enacted by Congress.\n\nAnd so I think that the Court should keep that in mind when thinking about the level of scrutiny here.\n\nThere were a lot of questions about how to take account of disputed medical evidence when there might be some uncertainty, and I want to make a few points.\n\nAs my friend acknowledged, that doesn't go to the level of scrutiny.\n\nSo that doesn't mean that you should ignore a sex classification when one exists in the statute.\n\nBut, at the point of applying heightened scrutiny, the Court can take context into account.\n\nAnd we're not asking courts to step in here and say we want to figure out as a matter of policy exactly what the right approach is.\n\nBut you can ask the familiar judicial questions like does the state actually have any evidence to support its claims that there's a harm to adolescent health and is this law severely over-and underinclusive. And if the Court conducts the analysis here in the first instance, this law doesn't look anything like a typical medical regulation to protect adolescent health.\n\nThat would look like the West Virginia law, where you're tailoring it but still leaving some possibility for care when it can have enormous benefits.\n\nAnd the reason it doesn't look like a typical medical regulation is because the -- the legislature was doing something different in trying to get minors to appreciate their sex and not become disdainful.\n\nThat's not a medical-based justification, but I think it shows exactly why the State drew the lines where it did.\n\nFinally, I think the Court should think about the real-world consequences of laws like SB1.\n\nConsider its effects on an individual.\n\nAs noted, their gender dysphoria was so severe that they were throwing up before school every day.\n\nThey thought about going mute because their voice caused them so much distress. And they have told the courts that getting these medications after a careful consultation process with their doctors and their parents has saved their life.\n\nTheir parents say they are now thriving.\n\nBut Tennessee has come in and categorically cut off access to their care, and they say this is about protecting adolescent health, but this law harms their health and the health of all other transgender adolescents for whom these medications are a necessity.\n\nAnd the State says it doesn't even want the courts to take a look at whether this protects adolescent health.\n\nBut the reason they can't have these medications is because of their birth sex, and a sex-based line like that can't stand on rational basis review.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, counsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

The first is that he constantly reads documents about sales, all right, and the second is they come up with a lot of sort of outside evidence that sales were, in fact, down.\r\n\r\nJudge: So they don't have him saying \"I read the document and the document says X,\" but there's a lot of evidence that really indicates that the document said X because that's the evidence in the world.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge: So, again, I think it's what did the CEO know and when did he know it.\r\n\r\nJudge: In your hypothetical, the when question is answered in a way that it's not at all with all the allegations in this case.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So we have no idea when the CEO got that information. In your case, I think it's possible to infer based on everything that the CEO might have had access to that information and did it.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Here, you've got a very different circumstance because you've got a product which is just a component in which they can't track end users.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: The only allegation that --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: So --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- they tracked end users is -- is --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: -- as I hear what you're saying, you're not really saying that you have to -- I mean, you're -- you know, that you have to have the -- the contents of those documents, as long as what the complaint alleges, you know, and plausibly so, is that he stares at a lot of documents and the evidence suggests that the documents would have said something that's quite different from what he presents to the public.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: You've got to describe --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: And so that's not -- you know, that's good for you and that's bad for you. That's not a bright-line rule, and that's good for you because we don't like bright-line rules in this context and have said so a thousand times. But it's bad for you because, as the -- as -- as what you're saying from the podium in terms of the rule you think we should adopt gets more and more like the sort of thing that we usually ask for, it becomes less and less clear why we took this case, number one, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, and, number two, why you should win it.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So our rule has always been the same.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: We've always said it's not a bright-line rule, that it's a contextual rule, contextualized rule, and one in which you are to ask, you know, have the particulars been disclosed? And what we're basically seeking is a definition of particularity. In this case, that would mean at least answering what that data was that showed a deviation from the CEO's public statements and what he knew.

{"id": "55", "dialogue": "Judge: So, with respect to how to identify a facial sex classification in the first place, I don't think there's any relevant difference between the Court's approach in Bostock and what this Court has long done under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn both contexts, the Court has made clear that the right to equal treatment is an individual right, so you look at the particular person and see how the law affects them.\n\nAnd the Court in both contexts has already made clear that sex just needs to be one but-for causal factor, it doesn't have to be the sole reason or the primary reason.\n\nSo, for purposes of identifying whether facial sex classification is happening at the outset, we think it's equal protection principles, as much as Bostock, that carries the day, although, of course, Bostock reinforces those principles.\n\nYou asked why this case isn't controlled by Geduldig and Dobbs.\n\nThe Court's reasoning there was that when you have a statute that doesn't classify based on sex on its face at all, the fact that the medical condition might be something that only one sex can experience isn't a basis to necessarily say that's facial sex discrimination.\n\nBut that doesn't apply in any -- in any relevant respect here, first, because, here, we have the facial sex classification.\n\nThe statute says no medications that are inconsistent with your sex.\n\nAnd, second, these aren't drugs that are limited to one sex or another.\n\nBoth males and females alike for decades have been prescribed puberty blockers, hormones, testosterone, estrogen.\n\nThey produce the same physical characteristics, as I was saying to Justice Thomas, no matter whether your birth sex is male or female.\n\nSo this doesn't look anything like pregnancy, where the Court found that the medical condition itself was expressly limited to one sex.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I -- I -- I'm sure -- I'm not sure that's anything more than a play on words.\n\nSuppose the statute said -- let's just talk about puberty blockers.\n\nSuppose the statute said that puberty blockers may not be prescribed or administered to any minor for the purpose of preventing the onset of puberty prior to the time when puberty generally occurs, okay?\n\nThat statute makes no reference whatsoever to anybody's sex.\n\nIt applies to all minors.\n\nWould you say the same thing about that?\n\nJudge: So, I'm sorry, if I'm understanding the hypothetical correctly, the statute says you can't take puberty blockers before the time when you would ordinarily have puberty, so it's ruling out precocious puberty?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You cannot -- no, it doesn't rule out precocious puberty.\n\nIt rules out the administration of a puberty blocker for the purpose of preventing puberty from occurring at the time when it generally does.\n\nJudge: I see.\n\nSo, if you're hypothesizing a statute where, in essence, the legislature is trying to get at the idea of prohibiting access to these medications for gender dysphoria reasons or otherwise, then maybe you would apply an Arlington Heights type of analysis.\n\nBut, of course, that kind of law that you're hypothesizing would also prevent people from taking puberty blockers if they have cancer and want to preserve their fertility because it would prevent them from undergoing puberty at the ordinary time.\n\nI think that's why the legislature hasn't tried to try to circumvent a facial sex classification by drafting a law like that.\n\nIt would have many other applications that the State might not want to aim at.\n\nThat's very different from a law like this, where the State was being clear we only want to prevent the medications when it's inconsistent with sex, and we're doing that because we have an interest in having minors appreciate their sex and not be disdainful of their sex.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, let me ask one final question that addresses Geduldig and Dobbs.\n\nLet's take Geduldig first.\n\nOne could make the same argument in Geduldig that you've made here.\n\nA man cannot -- which concerned whether a pregnant woman was entitled to disability benefits for -- for time missed at work when a man would be entitled to disability -- to benefits for time missed at work.\n\nSo, in that situation, a man cannot work due to a medical condition that prevents him from working.\n\nHe gets benefits.\n\nA woman cannot work due to a medical condition, pregnancy, that prevents her from working for a period of time.\n\nShe doesn't get benefits.\n\nIt's the same argument you're making here.\n\nOr we could do it in Dobbs.\n\nA man who has a medical condition that causes physical and mental distress and pain and limits his daily activities cannot -- can get a corrective medical procedure.\n\nLet's say it's a hip replacement.\n\nBut a woman who has a medical condition that produces similar consequences, namely pregnancy, cannot get an abortion.\n\nSo you can make exactly the same argument that you make here under Geduldig and under Dobbs, and yet there was no equal protection problem in either of those cases.\n\nJudge: And that's because the Court said that there was no facial sex classification insofar as using pregnancy does not automatically mean that that's a proxy for sex.\n\nBut, here, there's a facial sex classification.\n\nNo one can take these medications if it would be inconsistent with their sex.\n\nAnd that's imposing on the face of the statute two parallel rules on classes of people according to their sex: all adolescent males who want to take these medications to feminize their bodies and all adolescent females who want to take these medications for masculinizing purposes.\n\nThat's a facial sex classification through and through --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: All right.\n\nJudge: -- and I don't think it's controlled by Dobbs or Geduldig.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: General, just to unpackage some of this argument, your point, I think, is very clear that Bostock is pertinent only to the extent that, whether it's Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause, the first question is, is the legislature using sex as a classification, correct?\n\nJudge: That's right.\n\nSo our argument is that when you're looking for whether there's a facial sex classification, under the Equal Protection Clause, it has always been the same but-for causation principles.\n\nAnd, of course, we agree with the logic of Bostock, but we think that that logic carries over in this context, where the Court has already said it just needs to be one but-for cause, it doesn't need to be the only cause, and one way you look at that is seeing whether the application of the statute changes when you change the person's sex.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Now Bostock is very different than this case because, in Bostock, what we said is, if you use sex at all, unless you have a statutory exemption, you can't do it, correct?\n\nJudge: Exactly.\n\nAnd I think that's an important --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And, here, under the Equal Protection Clause, we recognize there are inherent differences between the sexes.\n\nJudge: And that can sometimes provide a legitimate basis for classification.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's the point, isn't it?\n\nJudge: So you're exactly right.\n\nThe standards for liability are different.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Now --\n\nJudge: Under Bostock and under Title VII, you can't use sex.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- with respect to the discussion about the European countries and the fact that they haven't limited these treatments altogether, the Cass report, as you point out, explicitly says that medical intervention might be necessary for some adolescents, correct?\n\nJudge: That's right.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And that is recognized by all the European countries, correct?\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator":

{"id": "143", "dialogue": "Judge: All right. Well, speaking of what we said, you mentioned the Anderson case. I read that case to be about whether or not state laws \"impose an undue burden on the performance of the bank's functions.\" So, I mean, yes, you picked out some language that suggests that this is about sort of power at some level of generality. But it seemed to me that this was about whether this -- the law at issue in that case was \"so burdensome\" as to be inapplicable. It wasn't about the nature. It was about, as people have said, the degree.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think you're absolutely correct. In Anderson, and when it contrasts the California case, is talking about an undue burden because it didn't affect the power. And what the Court said -- and that's why we have two tests. We have a fallback test. One is, if it affects the national banking power and controls the attribute of the product, preempted, preempted, preempted. There is a second undue burden test that looks at the practical impact, but the -- the delta between the two sides is we think that can be as a matter of law and looks -- it looks at a patchwork across 50 states. The California case said it was preempted without any factual record. In Anderson, it said it wasn't preempted with any factual record. They say with no case, not one case in 150 years of precedent, would this Court look to a factual record. They're relying on some trial court record? That's their best case? When the -- the Supreme Court didn't even talk about it? I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know whether Congress intended a factual record for banking preemption.\n\nNow, on the OCC, I think, you know, there are three reasons why it is just simply implausible that by codifying Barnett Bank, Congress tended to overrule it or somehow upset it. And the first is what I already mentioned, the 30 words of text that says you need to follow Barnett Bank. And the second is there is a specific provision in 25b(c), we rely on it, the OCC relies on it, that says OCC must follow the legal standard of Barnett Bank, without any reference to the \"prevents or significantly interferes.\" So they can't possibly mean two separate things. Congress told OCC to follow Barnett Bank, not to look at significant effect.\n\nAnd the third reason we think it's just completely doubly bizarre and backwards that you would take Congress being mad at the OCC and imposing procedural requirements is somehow they intended to impose a new substantive standard on courts when they weren't mad at you, they weren't mad at courts, and impose a standard that no one's ever heard of or applied before, that you would go fact by fact -- fact by fact, law by law, bank by bank. And he did a little fancy footwork when you said, would this proceed bank by bank? He answered by saying, well, that would be the OCC. He never told you what would happen with the question about what would happen if Bank of America couldn't prove it, but, you know, another national bank, Citi, Citibank, could do it? There's no answer to that.\n\nAnd in terms of the impact, you know, the notion that -- the representative speaking on behalf not of the OCC but the Justice Department, that you just have to look sort of at the records of the bank, the biggest problem with something like interest rates, which makes this a very easy case, is today 2 percent is four times the national savings. At the time of the case, it was 33 percent times the national savings rate. And at the -- excuse me, that's another case. At the time of the current case, it's 10 times.\n\nI don't know what you think. Maybe you should let the courts know. Let's look at ATM fees. Four dollars sounds -- I don't know, maybe 1.50? And then we can go to credit card reward programs. We'd have to have a consumer survey. I think I'd like 2 percent back on my credit card, but maybe states say it has to be 4 percent. And I just don't even know how they would do this.\n\nJudge: But, Counsel, I thought all the national banks were pretty much the same in terms of their powers. Like I thought we were talking about what -- what -- what a state law is doing to the national bank power. So it's not at the level of a particular bank. It is -- and any of the banks could make the argument, and once they do, it would come up to the Supreme Court and we would decide ultimately, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, that's this case. The Second Circuit said a mortgage -- mortgage escrow account is a direct assault on national banks' power.\n\nJudge: I guess I just don’t understand why it's so hard. Like we do --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don't think it is hard.\n\nJudge: No, no, no. What I'm saying is you're making the argument that it is really going to be very challenging for banks if we rule against you in this case, and I don't understand why that's the case.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, you have, since the Reagan administration, a former OCC comptroller telling you it would create a seismic sea change and uncertainty. So that's the view of comptrollers from Reagan to -- all the way with current officials. You haven't even heard from the OCC, which regulates the national banking system. That alone should scare you tremendously, that you don't even have the OCC up here.\n\nIn terms of how hard it would be, I don't think I've heard a satisfactory answer on what interest rate would be too much and how national banks could make that showing. But take just interest rates on savings accounts. I don't even know what the -- the bank would say. They would say, well, we can do it; we'll have to --\n\nJudge: Don't you have to say something? It's your burden. You're trying -- you have the burden in the law to show this substantially interferes. If your answer is I don't know what we would show, then I guess you lose.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Not if 150 years of case law is relevant and Barnett Bank codified it, because in no case has a bank -- the Supreme Court ever say, well, where's your facts, bank? Franklin itself is the best case on point. And both -- and I also think it's significant that the Court in Watters, that's the Supreme Court, I mean, that's -- that's actually you, you read Barnett Bank and had the most sweeping language you could possibly have about what Barnett Bank meant, and it said states cannot control banks, period. That's the Supreme Court. That interpreted Barnett Bank. So, you know -- and that's why I think OCC has always taken this position.\n\nJudge: You're taking that quote out of context because I looked at it. It says the states can exercise no control over national banks, nor in any way affect their operation except insofar as Congress may see proper to permit.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure. For sure.\n\nJudge: And that's what the whole issue is, how far did Congress permit here?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, two solicitor generals said in briefs before you what I said. So I'm happy standing on their view across several administrations about what Barnett Bank means.\n\nJudge: The state statutes have to be non-discriminatory.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: So, you know, one way you could look at this is, if a state statute is non-discriminatory, how much damage could it really be doing?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And I think that's part of the problem, which is what the Franklin case illustrates and what this case illustrates, is the plaintiffs will always say, well, you applied it to your state banks, so what's the problem?\n\nJudge: That's the question.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The problem goes much deeper --\n\nJudge: I mean, it seems as though there should be a kind of presumption that if the state is doing it for the state banks, it's not really interfering with bank powers in a way that we should care about. There might be exceptions to that, and that’s what the language is designed to accomplish, to pick the exceptions to that where something has gone wrong such that even a non-discriminatory law does something special to national banks.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "722", "dialogue": "Judge: Suppose the (a)(1) notice didn't have the right to counsel in it.  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So the answer, I think, is the same as before. We view the right to counsel information as an important piece of information, but the lack of that information does not affect the validity of the proceedings.  \n\nJudge: Right. So it does suggest—you’re not informed of your right to counsel. Nonetheless, you have to show up. And I don’t see that any of your safeguards actually protect the non-citizen in that situation. What’s going to prevent the non-citizen from being ordered removed, not being able to reopen, notwithstanding that he’s never been told that he has a right to a lawyer?  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: What prevents that result, Your Honor, is the regulations that I was referring to. If the notice to appear does not contain the information about the right to counsel, that is an incomplete notice to appear that would be rejected by the immigration court.  \n\nJudge: Well—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I also want to emphasize that—  \n\nJudge: Counsel, let me pause there. Your regulations are interesting because they suggest that a lot of things are required in a notice to appear, except stuff that the government finds inconvenient, like the hearing date, and try to resuscitate the pre-statutory regime that existed before where the government could issue as many notices as it wanted. So the regulations themselves may or may not comply with the statute. As another judge pointed out, they may or may not change. The only statutory hook I think you’ve identified to save the problem is the clear and convincing evidence requirement, but that’s just a clear and convincing evidence requirement that the notice was given. And here, the notice would be the Section 2 notice, the notice of change.  \n\nSo none of that means that the Section 1 notice to appear has to be complete or, in fact, anything other than a blank document, right?  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I think, if we were in a world where we had repealed all our regulations and somehow—  \n\nJudge: I’m not—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —convinced the immigration judge to—  \n\nJudge: Forget about your regulations. The law. Your interpretation of the law has to hang together and make sense of the law. Otherwise, it is a “trust us” argument. “Trust us. We will have our own internal operating procedures.” I’m asking you about statutory interpretation.  \n\nAnd we normally think statutes are coherent, sensible, not ridiculous. You invoked common sense in your opening argument. And here, one consequence of your argument, I think, is that the notice to appear can be a blank document and that you can remove someone in absentia based on a notice of change that simply says “show up on a date certain.”  \n\nThe non-citizen may or may not even know that this is really the government. It’s just a date to show up somewhere. It doesn’t contain notice of charges or the right to a lawyer. And the government wins, right?  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I have several responses to that question. First, this is not a case where we are simply asking you to trust us. This is a statute that has been on the books for nearly 30 years—  \n\nJudge: So let’s talk—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —and has been used—  \n\nJudge: —about the statute. Let’s—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —hundreds of thousands of times.  \n\nJudge: Am I correct that the clear and convincing evidence rule that you’re relying on as a matter of statutory interpretation would allow the government to remove somebody based on a blank notice to appear if they failed to appear on a notice of change that the government can prove was properly issued?  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Our position is that if a non-citizen receives a notice of hearing saying “show up at immigration proceedings at this date and time,” then, yes, the non-citizen needs to comply with that.  \n\nJudge: Okay.  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And if the non-citizen doesn’t attend, they could be removed.  \n\nJudge: And so if that happens—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s very far away from the facts of these cases.  \n\nJudge: If that happens, if that’s the consequence of your statutory interpretation, we have to ask whether that fits with common sense, as you say.  \n\nOne common-sense consequence might be this: If the government can issue blank notices to appear, which it has found inconvenient in the past to comply with, need only file notice of changes, and then remove people who fail to show up, why wouldn’t it proceed in exactly that fashion going forward?  \n\nAs I understand it, about a third of cases in immigration proceedings result in in absentia removals—failures to appear. So why not issue a blank notice to appear because they’re difficult, then issue a compliant notice of change, require appearance on a date certain, and then remove about a third of the non-citizens in this country without any notice of the charges against them or their right to counsel or anything else? Then, in the remaining cases, file compliant notices to appear.  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, we do not do that and have never done that—  \n\nJudge: I’m not asking you—  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —for several reasons.  \n\nJudge: Let’s put aside the “trust us” arguments. What would prevent the government from following where the incentives of that decision might lead as a matter of law?  \n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And, Your Honor, what I’m disputing is that we would have any incentive ever to do that because, if we used a blank document, there would not be a removal proceeding under our own regulations in which to order the non-citizen removed.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "349", "dialogue": "Judge: So I guess that drawing a line between testimony about a class or a group on the one hand and testimony about an individual happens at trial all the time. Judges are familiar with drawing that line.\n\nI'm interested in the law professors' evidence professors' brief because they point to one context in which that happens with fair frequency, which is with respect to eyewitness testimony.\n\nAnd they say courts often allow expert testimonial regarding factors that, on average, interfere with accurate eyewitness identifications.\n\nHowever, courts do not allow experts to draw an individual inference and testify that a particular witness is likely inaccurate.\n\nThey go on to say, because social science research isn't reliably—even though it is itself replicated and reliable, it can't support a reliable statement about an individual case, especially when that social scientist hasn't really examined that individual case. And so judges, they at least say, are pretty familiar with the kind of line.\n\nSo is this the line you're drawing?\n\nProsecution: Yeah, well, I think that brief—the point the professors are making in that brief is that concerns that the expert has testified in some way that overstates the expert's ability to draw an inference about the particular case are not unfamiliar in federal court.\n\nCourts handle those kinds of concerns every day under Rule 702.\n\nAnd you could have a similar dynamic for testimony like this.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nAnd I guess what I'm suggesting is that there is a difference between an expert talking about a group, an \"on average,\" and here are the statistics that relate to how people operate or think or whatever as a group, and that that's actually a different kind of testimony and ultimate, you know, goal and helpful thing for jurors when they are trying to draw the inference as to whether or not this individual, right, is a member of that group, meaning acted in the same way or thought in the same way.\n\nThat's still left to the jury so long as the expert doesn't himself say—go on to say, and this individual is in that group, right?\n\nProsecution: I think that's exactly right.\n\nWe think that's how Rule 704(b) should work.\n\nAnd here, the expert certainly left a great deal for the jury—a great number of the links in the chain of inferences for the jury itself to draw.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nRebuttal?\n\nDefense: Thank you. I'd like to start by just making absolutely clear for the Court that the government is not defending the Ninth Circuit's case law on Rule 704(b).\n\nSo, on the mirroring situation the Court has talked about, there's a Ninth Circuit case from 2005 called Younger, where the Ninth Circuit says that evidence is admissible because it does not particularly speak to the defendant, with \"the defendant\" in italics in that opinion.\n\nSo the government there is moving away from the Ninth Circuit's view.\n\nI don't fully understand exactly what the government is saying about what we've called 100 percent testimony or \"always\" testimony, but I do want to absolutely stress those are real-world examples.\n\nThey're at page 23 of our brief.\n\nThat's the exact testimony that agents like the expert in this case gave in cases like this until 2013, when the government discovered there actually were some blind mules out there.\n\nSo it's merely a situation of this particular scenario where the government has backed off it for empirical reasons.\n\nBut you could have other cases where an expert would testify in the real world that people with schizophrenia can never tell right from wrong, that executives in corporations, when they lie to government investigators, always know they're telling a lie.\n\nThat would be perfectly real-world examples. And I think, regardless of what the government's precise position is, it's very difficult to argue that kind of testimony would be okay under Rule 704(b).\n\nLet me give you one last scenario about the government's line-drawing problems.\n\nThere's a case called Watson from the Third Circuit that's in our brief.\n\nThe government itself seems to agree with the outcome in Watson.\n\nIn that case, the prosecutor asked the expert: Do you have an opinion as to whether or not the defendant here had the requisite intent?\n\nThe expert says: Yes, I have an opinion. People like this generally have the requisite intent.\n\nThe government seems to agree that is out under Rule 704(b).\n\nNow, maybe that's because, at pages 28 to 30, it draws a contextual rule of some kind.\n\nBut there are these very difficult line-drawing problems under the government's rule.\n\nOur rule is simple.\n\nIf you talk about the defendant herself, it's covered by Rule 704(b), or a class of people including the defendant, you're covered by Rule 704(b).\n\nHere, the class of people, the expert is quite specific—people carrying large quantities of drugs across the border.\n\nThat's the class.\n\nThe defendant here is unquestionably a member of that class.\n\nAnd so his testimony is about the defendant.\n\nI want to say one last thing.\n\nSome of the Justices asked about some of the history and intent of Rule 704(b).\n\nLet's just use the Hinckley case.\n\nAnd the Senate report is only a page long.\n\nI would urge you to read that if you think that's important here.\n\nAnd what the Senate said was we're concerned about experts testifying about the subject of mens rea.\n\nAnd so after the Hinckley trial, if an expert were to testify, we think people like this who are exhibiting these conditions generally couldn't tell right from wrong or probably couldn't tell right from wrong or in most circumstances couldn't tell right from wrong, it seems unreasonable to think Congress would have thought that was okay under the Hinckley trial.\n\nThe problem in the Hinckley trial was that the expert was testifying not just about facts from which a jury could infer mens rea, but the expert was expressing an opinion on the ultimate issue of mens rea from which the jury could go into the jury room and do nothing but say, oh, we agree with the expert.\n\nAnd whether the expert expressed that opinion in terms of probably this defendant had the mens rea or didn't have the mens rea or certainly, the problem is that the jury can go back to the jury room and say: Look, sounds like the expert thinks people like this generally have the mens rea. He must be right. We'll go along with that.\n\nThe point of the right to a jury trial and the point of the ultimate issue doctrine is that when it comes to the special subject of mens rea—and I want to be really specific here—mens rea as the element of the crime to convict or as the defense, that particular subject has a wall around it.\n\nThe jury is required to make an independent moralistic, qualitative determination.\n\nAnd that's what the expert did wrong here.\n\nHe said most people like this know they have drugs in their car.\n\nKnowledge is the exact element of the crime.\n\nSo whatever else Rule 704(b) may cover in terms of statements that cover mens rea, this one explicitly did, and that's why it went over the line.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "969", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?\n\nJudge: A couple quick questions, Mr. Frederick.\n\nFirst, with respect to your ultra vires argument, it sure sounds to me a lot like an APA challenge beyond statutory authority that would normally be brought in district court in the first instance.\n\nHelp me with that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, what I would say is that we have not found a case on all fours with the one that we have where the ultra vires argument was brought directly to the court of appeals.\n\nBut what I would say is that the jurisdiction, the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the Hobbs Act, 2342(4) --\n\nJudge: I understand.\n\nIf you get in the Hobbs Act, you're in the Hobbs Act.\n\nBut assume we're not in the Hobbs Act.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nBut what I'm saying is that 2342 says all final orders, the exclusive jurisdiction --\n\nJudge: I see.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- shall be in the courts of appeals.\n\nAnd so our reading of that is that that answers the question of where you can bring the argument.\n\nIt doesn't say --\n\nJudge: Got you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- how or what the argument is.\n\nJudge: I follow you. And then, with respect to the struggle over the D.C. Circuit order, I didn't see anything in the opinion addressing the statutory question, so -- and I didn't see anybody below arguing that that -- that -- normally, for issue preclusion to have an effect, you have to have a ruling on -- on the question at hand.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: And somebody has the burden to show that it applies.\n\nAnd I didn't see either ruling on this question in the D.C. Circuit.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's correct.\n\nAnd that's --\n\nJudge: And I didn't see the government suggest or ISP suggesting that you were precluded as a matter of collateral estoppel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's correct. They've not made that oral waiver argument.\n\nAnd that's why it's important to understand the difference between an intervenor party and just a party to be able to say under the plain language of the Act you violated the Act. You've gone beyond the Act in approving this license.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJudge: One of the arguments on the other side is the Commission's interpreted the statutory scheme the same way for, you know, five decades and that that consistent, longstanding interpretation has itself significant weight as we interpret the statute.\n\nYou want to respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nThank you for asking that question, Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nIf you look at the Federal Register for the 1980 rules, there are two paragraphs on the question of does the agency have the authority to do offsite storage.\n\nOne paragraph says many commenters think it's a bad idea to do it anywhere but onsite.\n\nThe second paragraph says some commentators think that it's okay to do it offsite.\n\nSo we think it should be -- we should have the authority to choose.\n\nThey don't cite any provisions of the Atomic Energy Act.\n\nThey don't ground that policy in any particular statutory language.\n\nIt was the Commission's decision to do this simply on the basis of what they thought was a good idea.\n\nAnd then two years later, when Congress comprehensively addressed the subject in the Policy Act, the agency should have gone back and redone its rules.\n\nIt didn't do that.\n\nAnd that's why Mr. Stewart has to make a rather convoluted statutory argument deriving from these provisions in the Atomic Energy Act that don't speak to the question.\n\nJudge: Well, is it really that convoluted? It's basically that the Act was understood to authorize this, that the Commission recognized that authority, that Congress in 1982 had a chance to, was well aware of this issue and did not expressly preclude this, and then that's been the way it's been for, you know, 50 years.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, it is not how it has been.\n\nThe only example they have is a former reprocessing facility.\n\nThat is a production facility as defined in the Atomic Energy Act.\n\nThat's the Morris plant.\n\nWhen reprocessing failed, they had to do something with the spent nuclear fuel that had been sent to the Morris plant, and so what they did was kind of a jerry-rigged approach and said: It's here, we don't want to move it, let's just keep it here, and we'll store it onsite.\n\nAnd that has become the exemplar of their longstanding interpretation for offsite storage.\n\nIt -- it is really a stretch and makes no relation to the statutory test at all.\n\nJudge: One of the reasons longstanding interpretations matter, of course, is that private parties rely on those, and the amicus brief, for example, of the Nuclear Energy Institute makes -- makes clear that a lot of investment has happened based on what appeared to be a settled understanding of the authority.\n\nDo you want to respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\n\nThere -- there's been no actual construction of an offsite facility ever.\n\nThere have only been three approvals.\n\nOne, the Bullcreek example, was never built.\n\nSo that license was approved, no facility.\n\nThe only two other ones are before this Court.\n\nIt's Holtec in New Mexico, ISP in Texas.\n\nJudge: And then last question.\n\nPetitioners' counsel said, if your statutory argument is correct, they never needed a license to begin with.\n\nYou want to respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\n\nWhat I started with on the material -- on the facilities license is that in order to ensure the safe operation of the facility under 2133, 2134, and 2136, the Commission has always asserted the authority to make sure safe operations occur onsite, but that's part of the facilities license, which means you don't move it off the facility, which is the whole argument that they're trying to make here by saying it's lawful to take what is a materials license and -- and contort what authority that they were really asserting under the facilities license provision.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: Do you concede that the \"party aggrieved\" language is jurisdictional?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think that if it's jurisdictional, it can't be waived.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

On -- on -- on its -- its isolated terms, that's what the --\n\nJudge: That's what it says, that's what it says, isolated terms, okay. And I guess my question for you is the inverse of the one I asked your friend on the other side. The point in Schein was, if you agree to say the arbitrator gets to direct things, if this were all in one contract, it's possible some things would be arbitrated, agreed to arbitrate and some things would be -- you agree to send to court. And if it were in one contract, there's no doubt that the arbitrator would decide which -- which direction to route things, right? The only question is does the second contract make this different than it being in a single contract. And I struggle to see why that would be the case. And I furthermore struggle to see why you would care because your real argument is that the agreement is to litigate this in court. And the routing, who's going to do the routing? Now we're at the Supreme Court of the United States, years have passed, we still don't know where this case is going to be. You could have had an answer from an arbitrator that you belong in court years ago. Why didn't you? Again, I just struggle to see both sides why we're here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, to deal with the first part with the Ninth Circuit and the user agreement, I just want to make clear that the Ninth Circuit didn't just rely on this existence language. After it sort of regurgitated that --\n\nJudge: I'm not asking about the Ninth Circuit because it --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well -- well -- well --\n\nJudge: -- seems to me both sides have disavowed the Ninth Circuit's opinion.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- it -- it really --\n\nJudge: I'm asking why you are here because you could have had an answer from an arbitrator --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: -- because I think your -- your argument's really quite strong as to where this gets routed.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, we've -- we've already won in court. We've already won arbitrability in court. And they haven't challenged that here. So the only way they resurrect the arbitrability dispute at all is by winning the delegation agreement.\n\nJudge: My question is, though, if -- if you -- if you think you can win on -- on where this goes, why didn't you just go to the arbitrator to get a quick answer? Why -- why -- why litigate it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States? I'll try it one more time.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So -- so, I mean, I guess I'd have to go back and think about why I did it in the trial court, why I did it in the --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- in the Ninth Circuit. But, here, so arbitrability, not delegation, arbitrability is finally resolved by the federal courts because -- unless this Court sends that dispute back to an arbitrator.\n\nJudge: Right. Right.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Or the Ninth Circuit sends it back.\n\nJudge: That's why -- that's why we're here. We're at the -- at the antecedent question.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I don't want them to have a second chance to win arbitrability. They've already lost that.\n\nJudge: Can I ask you about the hypothetical about things being in one contract? Because I think it actually matters with respect to what's going on here. So, if we had one contract that just had one delegation provision and then later underneath it, it had user agreements, sweepstakes, or whatever, it didn't say anything, you would agree that that delegation clause would apply to the whole thing?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I think that's the best reading of the user agreements in isolation.\n\nJudge: All right. So -- but -- but -- but you're saying that, I guess, if we had one contract that had different parts and there was a delegation agreement that was in one part of it and then the other -- that went to the arbitrator and then, in the other, it was pretty clear the parties were saying this is delegated to the court, you're saying that would be a contract formation, the court would have to decide which one of those parts -- which one of those delegation intents was operable?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It would definitely be a different question if it -- if the two types of terms were contained in a single agreement between the same two parties.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Here, we have two separate agreements, two separate economic transactions, two separate groups of contracting parties, and that changes the intent analysis under -- under traditional rules of interpretation.\n\nJudge: The -- are you done?

{"id": "324", "dialogue": "Defendant’s Lawyer: And, Judge, in this case, we think that we did satisfy that burden because we did provide a new time and place.\nWe told the non-citizens where their removal hearings would be held, and so they had the information they needed to attend. And so I don't think that \"change\" is actually the operative word in the statutory scheme, but I don't want to fight you too hard on that because I do think that even if you think that a notice of hearing must change a previously set time or place for the hearing, that requirement is satisfied here because the ordinary meaning of the word \"change\" is very broad, and it encompasses the process of going from—\n\nJudge: So change is no change? Meaning you haven't set a time and place and we're going to change that and set what? Another no time and place?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, what we have done—\n\nJudge: You're saying no, it's going to be a time and place now.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, what we have done in the TB NTAs is to tell the non-citizen you're going to have a hearing.\nWe don't know when that hearing will be, but we have changed from that placeholder time to a specific time. And we think that under the ordinary meaning of \"change,\" particularly as it's used in this statutory scheme, going from an indeterminate time and place to a determined one is a kind of change.\n\nJudge: But didn't you lose that—\n\nJudge: I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: Didn't you lose that argument in Niz-Chavez? I mean, I understand and take your point, but I thought the Court said you really couldn't interpret the statute in that way or the word \"change\" in that way.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Respectfully, Your Honor, I don’t agree.\nI think the only issue that the Court decided in Niz-Chavez was whether we could compile two documents together to create \"a\" notice to appear, and the Court said that that definite article \"a\" indicated that the notice to appear needed to be a single document. And so we are not disputing for purposes of these cases that the notices to appear alone could not be the basis for in absentia removal, but what's critical about this case and what distinguishes this case from Pereira and Niz-Chavez is that Congress here created two forms of notice and it made both of them relevant for purpose of in absentia removal in a way that they are not relevant for purposes of the—\n\nJudge: Can you say more about that—\n\nJudge: Mr.—\n\nJudge: —two forms of notice? What do you mean?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I mean that they created both the paragraph (1) notice, the notice to appear, and the paragraph (2) notice, the notice of hearing or, as the other side refers to it, the notice of change.\n\nJudge: So you think those—\n\nJudge: Mr.—\n\nJudge: —operate completely independently of one another?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They're independent in the sense that they can both be independent valid bases for in absentia removal.\nI take the point that the notice to appear is what initiates the proceeding, and so, in some sense, you need to have a proceeding in order for there to be a notice of hearing to alter that proceeding. But I don't think it is the case that the TBD status of the notice to appear in any way invalidates the later notice of hearing, and that's because the statute is very clear about the requirements for a valid notice of hearing. It needs to set the new time and place, and we did that in this case.\n\nJudge: Mr. [Lawyer], what would happen if the non-citizen showed up to the right time and place in response to the notice of hearing, but the NTA had been incomplete? Would that be grounds for the non-citizen objecting that the entire proceeding was invalid? Because, after all, the statute does say \"shall,\" this following information shall be provided.\nSo, if the date and time were omitted from the initial one, would that be grounds for an invalidation of a proceeding?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor. All of the courts of appeals that have considered that issue and the Board when it has considered that issue have said that the requirements, both the statutory requirements and the regulatory requirements, regarding the notice to appear and the information it has to contain are claims processing rules, they are not jurisdictional rules, so they do not divest the immigration court of jurisdiction if there is information missing from the notice to appear.\n\nJudge: So is your position—let me try to state how I—I don't think you say it quite this way in your brief, but this is what I take from your brief, and I want to see if I'm understanding it correctly. A notice of hearing presupposes that there has been a notice to appear because, otherwise, well, both because of the word \"change\" and, otherwise, there would be no way for the alien to receive it because you have to know what address to send it to or have personally served it, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay.\nSo is it your position that once the notice of hearing arrives telling the non-citizen where and when to show up, even if there's some information lacking—and let's say it's information that's even maybe more significant than the date and time that the government has been omitting and it's maybe an incomplete statement of the grounds for removal—that the alien, by virtue of the in absentia provision, has an obligation to show up because he's on notice? It's not like he's not aware that he is in contact with Immigration and that there are removal proceedings underway.\nBut he has an obligation created by the notice of hearing to show up and at that point to register any objections he may have to the incomplete NTA?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That is our position, Your Honor.\nI want to make sure that I'm clear, though, that we think there are a number of safeguards that would prevent the result that you're talking about or the blank document hypothetical that the other side has raised, and if I could go into those protections.\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The first is the regulatory requirement that the notice to appear contain the charging information.\nSo, if we had a blank document or a document that was missing the charges against the non-citizen—\n\nJudge: Don't you need—sorry, don't you need the protection from the statute itself? Because the regulatory requirement can be subject to change.\nSo I think your better argument comes from the clear and convincing evidence requirement in the statute itself.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That was my second response, Your Honor, which is we bear the burden by clear and convincing evidence to prove that the non-citizen both received notice and that they are removable as charged.\nAnd so, if you have a document that lacks charges, we could not prove that the non-citizen actually is removable. And then the third—\n\nJudge: Suppose—I'm sorry.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the third protection I was going to refer to is the fact that in absentia removal is not automatic. There is an immigration judge who is sitting on the other side of the bench and who has to review the documents and decide whether in absentia removal is appropriate.\nAnd so I think it is highly unlikely that an immigration judge, in the circumstances with a blank document or a document without charges, would enter in absentia removal.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "980", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-1300, Nuclear Regulatory Commission versus Texas, and the consolidated case.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: First, the petitions for review should be dismissed because neither Texas nor Fasken was a party to the NRC licensing proceedings. Texas did not try to intervene in the agency adjudication.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Fasken moved to intervene, but its request was denied, and the court affirmed the denial.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And there is no sound basis for the court's ultra vires exception to the Hobbs Act's \"party aggrieved\" requirement.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If the Court reaches the merits, it should reverse the court of appeals' judgment. The Atomic Energy Act prohibits the unlicensed possession of spent nuclear fuel's constituent parts while authorizing the Commission to license private interim storage of those substances.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The Nuclear Waste Policy Act left that scheme intact.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And, since 1980, the NRC's regulations have provided for both onsite and offsite storage.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That system allows a substantial role for private market responses to the country's nuclear waste storage issues, subject to Commission oversight to ensure that storage is safe and consistent with statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I welcome the Court's questions.\r\n\r\nJudge: What does it take to be a party in these proceedings?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: In an adjudication, you would need to intervene, and the Commission's rules set out the process for intervention.\r\n\r\nJudge: So when can a party -- when can an interested person intervene?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The Commission's rules set out two requirements.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: One is that -- basically, a standing requirement, and that is, essentially, that you be an interested person, that your interests be affected by the outcome. And, second, the Commission's rules require what's called an admissible contention.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And the rules were changed in 1990. The changes were upheld by the court. And, basically, the problem the Commission had confronted was that it would get requests to intervene accompanied by very vague assertions.\r\n\r\nJudge: But -- so, aside from the substance, when can you intervene? When can an interested person intervene?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Essentially, the Commission will issue notice that a licensing proceeding is under way or will soon be under way, and then it will give a certain amount of time for part --\r\n\r\nJudge: How much? How much time?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think it was 60 or 90 days to give notice of your intent to intervene. And then there were written submissions.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board passed in the first instance on various requests to intervene. And then there was an appeal available to the full Commission.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And then Fasken sought judicial review of the Commission's denial of its request to intervene.\r\n\r\nJudge: The regulation that you cited, how is that supported by the statutory language?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The court in the case Union of Concerned Scientists that I referred to a moment ago, I think it's in 920 F.2d, said that this was an aspect of agencies' traditional broad authority to regulate their own procedures.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And as -- as I --\r\n\r\nJudge: Does it go -- it seems to go beyond the statutory language itself.\r\n\r\nJudge: Is that correct? Do you agree with that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I agree that the statutory language in itself would not impose this requirement.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And the Commission's prior rules had not done so.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The -- the --\r\n\r\nJudge: And in looking at the statutory language, it says that any person who requests a hearing and their interests are affected shall be admitted. That's a mandatory obligation as I read it.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: And Fasken, their interest is affected and they requested a hearing.\r\n\r\nJudge: Those -- those things are undisputed, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: So --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I -- I --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- help me with the previous question.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I guess I would say were, first, when Fasken appealed to the court from the denial of its request to intervene, it didn't make the argument that the Commission's rules were invalid or it had a statutory right to --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, it said it had a statutory right to intervene.\r\n\r\nJudge: And I read the court opinion.\r\n\r\nJudge: It didn't address that argument at all.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It has said that it has a right to intervene, but it was asserting that right under the Commission's own rules.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And I guess the second thing I would say is, at most, the argument you're suggesting would imply that Fasken ought to have been allowed to intervene, it ought to have been made a party.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: But the fact is it wasn't --\r\n\r\nJudge: He could have thought it was futile given the court precedent on the question, yes?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It -- well, it -- it could have thought -- the arguments that Fasken made were actually that it was entitled to intervene under the Commission's own rules. It was not arguing that the rules imposed an invalid extra-statutory requirement.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So it had no reason to think that --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- that that was invalid, but your --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- actually, I -- I -- I've got it before me, and it says that they're entitled -- that they act -- NRC abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in an excess of statutory jurisdiction by not admitting them.\r\n\r\nJudge: It -- and it goes on to talk about the policies and regulations, but it cites the statute in its petition for review.\r\n\r\nJudge: And, again, the court didn't address it.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I guess the other thing I would say is they could have sought en banc review.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They could have sought certiorari review.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And what they are in essence doing --\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "106", "dialogue": "Judge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nBut -- but I'm asking you, if we were to reach it, what's wrong with that? Do you resist that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No --\r\n\r\nJudge: And, if so, why?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There may well be principles of -- of that kind of tracing that might work here.\r\n\r\nThe -- the only caution I would say is, one, the purposes of the FSIA and foreign sovereign immunity are different from trust law or equitable liens or criminal or civil forfeiture or money laundering or all of the other examples that employ those kinds of tracing rules.\r\n\r\nSo any tracing rule that might be borrowed from those contexts would have to take into account those purposes.\r\n\r\nAnd then the second is that international law itself has a sort of common law that has developed over the centuries, and that may have something to say about this as well.\r\n\r\nAnd I think those are really complicated issues that nobody has briefed, and that is why we would urge the Court not to -- not to weigh in on that.\r\n\r\nJudge: Sounds like good advice all around.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, Judge, if I could just push back one little bit, I think you --\r\n\r\nJudge: I think you've pushed back enough.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Kagan?\r\n\r\nJudge: You can push back now.\r\n\r\nSorry.\r\n\r\nIs it my turn? You can push back now and explain. You -- you obviously want to say more about the burden issue, so have at it.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The -- the -- the -- the only real point I -- I wanted to say is that if you didn't have, say, the House report and all you had was the statute, I think it would be pretty clear.\r\n\r\nIn Samantar, I think this Court encountered a very similar proposition.\r\n\r\nThe pre-FSIA history often treated state officials and actors and individuals as partaking of the sovereign immunity and they too could enjoy immunity.\r\n\r\nBut, in Samantar, you looked at it and you said, look, the FSIA has displaced what came before it.\r\n\r\nAlthough we interpret the text in light of that history, the clear text always takes precedence over whatever background rules might have applied beforehand.\r\n\r\nAnd the FSIA here says foreign sovereign and instrumentality, it's not defined to include individuals; therefore, the individuals do not partake of that sovereign immunity.\r\n\r\nThere might be some common law that they might be able to partake of but not FSIA immunity under the text.\r\n\r\nAnd, in that case, obviously, that was another instance where this principle wound up being plaintiff-friendly in that case because the defendant couldn't invoke FSIA immunity.\r\n\r\nI think, in this case, it would, you know, happen to work the other way.\r\n\r\nAnd so I think Samantar is a good example of where this Court has really privileged FSIA's text over the background history and certainly over legislative history.\r\n\r\nI think Verlinden is a great example of that.\r\n\r\nThere, the legislative history spoke only about American plaintiffs, American rights, violations of Americans' human rights.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Court looked at it in Verlinden and said, look, we know that's what the legislative history says, but the statute is not limited to domestic plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this foreign plaintiff is allowed to sue.\r\n\r\nAgain, you're privileging the text of the FSIA where it's clear.\r\n\r\nAnd we think, here, 1330 expressly makes it jurisdictional, and that has consequences, one of which is that the party invoking jurisdiction has to bear the burden of establishing it.\r\n\r\nJudge: And you say in the brief, even if we reject commingling and require some kind of traceability, if the burden's on the sovereign to show lack of traceability, that's going to be -- I think you used a burden that could be effectively impossible for the sovereign to meet in cases like this.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think that's right.\r\n\r\nAnd that's certainly how the D.C. Circuit understood what it was doing in this case, that -- and it expressly said both in the decision below, I think, and definitely in its 2016 decision in this case that Petitioners would bear the burden to show a lack of tracing. And, you know, when -- when many decades have passed, one would think that, especially given the purposes and the narrow departure from the restrictive theory that the expropriation exception is intended to effectuate, that where the property has essentially been lost, where it's lost its distinct identity, that all that means is that there isn't a U.S. forum available anymore.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't let the sovereign off the hook.\r\n\r\nIt just means there's not a forum here to hear those claims.\r\n\r\nAnd it would be, I think, quite perverse to flip it around and say, as soon as it's lost its distinct identity, at that point, when nobody can prove it one way or the other, at that point, U.S. courts are wide open to hear these claims that we --\r\n\r\nJudge: And you said earlier you think that this is all in compliance with international law, but it's got to be at the outer -- outer boundaries of that, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I --\r\n\r\nJudge: I mean, extending this further would seem to really push us into non-compliance with international norms and law, I would think.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would -- it would seriously risk undermining our conformity with international law.\r\n\r\nIt's a point this Court recognized in Helmerich and Philipp, and I think it applies here as well.\r\n\r", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "599", "dialogue": "Judge: As I see the question my way, she has a liberty interest in her marriage and having her husband visit. She doesn't have a liberty interest in having the visa granted, but she does have a liberty interest in knowing why and an opportunity to oppose it if there is an opposition that can be had. But the review would be very limited. In a previous case, we said the process due is just knowing the reason and a statutory citation because she's entitled to know he was a terrorist. In a conviction, the husband has gotten full notice, all the grounds have been told to the wife because there's been a public adjudication of that ground. Similarly, with all the other examples you provide, full process has been provided.\n\nBut what you're saying is I have a right and, judicially created, we're going to say, there is no process whatsoever you're entitled to. Now you're saying you're entitled to what Congress permits you to have. And so the question is, what's that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In this context, that's not even under that precedent. Congress has specifically said that we don't have to give a reason at all if this is the reason for the denial. But I would say that we don't think that there is a separate category of liberty interests for getting information as opposed to the underlying liberty interest. And so the fact that she wants to live with her husband in the United States doesn't mean that she has a liberty interest in having information related to something that prevents her from—prevents him from doing that.\n\nJudge: Makes little sense to me in the example I gave.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Pardon?\n\nJudge: Makes little sense to me in the example I gave about the mistaken identity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It—\n\nJudge: She would be seeking to exercise her right to live with him on the ground that you don't have a statutory basis to exclude him.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But she doesn't have a constitutional right to participate in that proceeding and say you got this decision wrong.\n\nJudge: Well, that's—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And that is not unusual that there are instances where nobody is able to get review. As a previous concurring opinion pointed out, we give the examples of the prisoner who was not able to challenge a transfer to a different prison, the soldier who is not able to challenge a military deployment. In another case, where the Court relied on another precedent, that was an instance—\n\nJudge: But they held no constitutional—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —where nobody was able to get enforcement of that judicial—of that restraining order.\n\nJudge: You're not mentioning independent constitutional rights. All right. Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: I think I just want to understand the conversation that you had with another judge before about the nature of the constitutional interest here versus in a prior case.\n\nSo assume for purposes of this question that the prior case does require some kind of limited judicial review—in other words, this legitimate and bona fide state explanation—in the case where there is a constitutional right implicated, as there was in that case. And the question that I thought I heard the other judge asking was: If you assume that, why would this constitutional right be less important than the constitutional right that was implicated in the prior case?\n\nIn other words, the right of a few professors to listen to some guy for a few hours—why would that be more important than the right of a person to be able to live with their spouse in this country?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: And are you saying that it is, or are you saying that once we—once we think of that prior case in that way, yes, this constitutional right is just as important?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, I don't think that we've tried to compare the constitutional rights in that regard. I think that we would say that prior case hasn't decided the one—\n\nJudge: Yeah, I—I get that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —and, therefore, we're just making a separate argument—\n\nJudge: But if we assume that prior case—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —about this liberty interest.\n\nJudge: If we assume that prior case has decided the one, you would not—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well—\n\nJudge: —contest that this constitutional right is any different?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—I—I would suggest that there could be a difference between First Amendment rights and the Due Process Clause and the third-party interests that are at stake in the due process analysis under another precedent, but, as I said to another judge, I still don't think that that means that a spouse could come in and have a better claim because they want to talk in person with their spouse instead of, you know, over the telephone.\n\nJudge: Right. Well, she wouldn't need a better claim if you were willing to say, yes, this—the right—the right of marriage and the burden that this places on that right is just as important as the right of listening to, you know, a lecturer—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah. And—\n\nJudge: —that was at issue in that prior case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I think my basic answer to that, Judge, is the assumption of your question, which is that we think that the prior case didn't actually decide that, which is why it's open for the Court to decide the first question here. If it wants to assume that there's a liberty interest here that is equal to what the Court assumed was at stake in that prior case and sort of assumed was at issue in another case and therefore gave a very limited form of review, then—then—then you'd be doing an analysis under that case, and we think that we would win.\n\nJudge: Okay.

First, it is a concern that can be addressed directly.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nThe reason why there's no evidence in this record about whether that kind of direct prohibition on TikTok, Incorporated, from sharing sensitive user data with anybody, including ByteDance, the reason why the record is devoid of any evidence of that is because Congress never considered the other side of the balance.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the minimum that Congress has to do under the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nIt's got to at least consider the -- the consequences of shutting down a speech platform used by 170 million Americans against the benefits of an alternative like simply saying to TikTok's employees, you're essentially going to get massive fines, potentially jail sentences, if you share any of that sensitive user data with anybody, not TikTok, not ByteDance -- I'm sorry, not ByteDance, not China, not anybody else in the world.\r\n\r\nYet there's nothing in this record that suggests they even considered that alternative.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWhat happens after January 19th if you lose this case? Can you just spell that out?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nAt least as I understand it, we go dark.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the platform shuts down.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nUnless there's a divestiture?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nUnless there's a divestiture.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nA presidential extension --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\n-- President Trump exercises his authority to extend it by not -- but he can't do that on January 19th.\r\n\r\nOn January 19th, we still have President Biden, and on January 19th, as I understand it, we shut down.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that come January 20th, 21st, 22nd, we might be in a different world. Again, that's one of the reasons why I think it makes perfect sense to issue a preliminary injunction here and simply buy everybody a little breathing space.\r\n\r\nThis is an enormously --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWhat do you mean by \"shut down\" too? Can you just spell that out?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nSo --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nIf -- if you can.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\n-- the app -- one, the app is not available in the app stores.\r\n\r\nThat's at a minimum.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition, what the Act says is that all of the other types of service providers can't provide service either.\r\n\r\nNow there's enormous consequences for violating that for the service providers.\r\n\r\nSo, essentially, you know, what they're going to say is that, you know, I think, we're not going to be providing the services necessary to have you see it.\r\n\r\nSo it's essentially going to stop operating.\r\n\r\nI think -- I think that's the consequence of this law, which, again, is why a short reprieve here would make all the sense in the world.\r\n\r\nIt's an enormously consequential decision, and it -- and -- and I think all would benefit if it weren't necessary.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nJustice Barrett?\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nSo I just want to -- just kind of following up on Justice Kavanaugh's questions.\r\n\r\nLet's say I agree with you that some level of scrutiny applies and --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- I'm trying to figure out which level of scrutiny applies, and I'm trying to figure out if there's content discrimination.\r\n\r\nAnd let me ask you a different question than I did before --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- about the algorithm.\r\n\r\nI mean, you keep saying \"shut down.\" The law doesn't say TikTok has to shut down.\r\n\r\nIt says ByteDance has to divest.\r\n\r\nIf ByteDance divested TikTok, we wouldn't be here, right? If -- if -- if ByteDance was willing to let you go and willing to let you take the source code with you, that would be fine, right? We would not be here?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nWell, Your Honor, if ByteDance divested, then the law wouldn't fall on TikTok.\r\n\r\nBut the law will -- the law, not ByteDance.\r\n\r\nThe law requires TikTok to shut down.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nBut that's because of ByteDance's choice, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nWell, it --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nI mean, this is like Justice Kagan's point.\r\n\r\nI mean, I'm trying to figure out how we account for the reality of third-party choices, and --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- the choices of third parties, that's the whole reason for the law being passed in the first place.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYeah, Your -- Your Honor, I --I -- I still don't -- I --I think that the way the analysis works is: Step 1, is there a First Amendment violation?\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nStep 2, you get to the question that we're grappling with: What standard of scrutiny do you apply? Typically, what you do is you ask: Is this law content-based? Is it content-based on its face? Is it content-based in its decision? Here, we know it's content-based on its face because it says what it says.\r\n\r\nWe know it's content-based in its motivation because the government concedes it's content-based in its motivation.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell, that's not quite what I'm asking.\r\n\r\nI mean, let's see.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nI think --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThat's the dispute between you --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- and the government, is, is it content-based if it's about divestiture and not about telling TikTok what content it can display on the platform.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nAnd I think it has to be because that's -- I think that that really goes to the first question: Does the burden fall on the speaker? If the burden falls on the speaker, that triggers the speaker's First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nBut the law is, in fact, content-based, whether it comes in the form of a divestiture or something else, when the law specifically says it's content-based.\r\n\r\nWe're worried about the content on the platform and when the government tells you that one of our reasons -- one of the things that we're worried about is TikTok, not ByteDance, but TikTok, Incorporated, and TikTok in the United States will, absent the divestiture, have a mix of content that we find objectionable.\r\n\r\nThey will mix around their videos in a way that is too pro-Chinese or too anti-American.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant\r\nAnd that is TikTok, the platform.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That all changed.\n\nNow we're going to apply the definition in the INA.\n\nThat definition means: A final order of removal either finds a noncitizen deportable or orders deportation.\n\nThere's another category, things that affect the validity of that, that merge into the final order.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "679", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Defendant:\r\nI --I do think, for the instrumentality question, it would be tricky because the statutory language talks about the property being owned by an agency or instrumentality.\r\n\r\nI can own things and not know where they are.\r\n\r\nYou can own something and lose it.\r\n\r\nAnd so --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYeah, but you'd have to -- someone would have to establish that it is still owned by you, right? That it -- it still exists, correct? We have to know where it is in order to determine --we have to know what it is, right, or that you own it?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nI suppose you could have a situation where I have title to something, but I don't know where the thing is that I have title to.\r\n\r\nYou would say that I still own the lost item.\r\n\r\nI guess that's a step removed from your art hypothetical.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not you are reading this as a statute that allows for suit against any foreign country that previously expropriated, whether we can figure out where their property -- that particular property is or not.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't see it as that, and I'm -- I'm worried about that.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nSo -- so I don't think it's that.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, I don't think that's this case because, given --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nNo, it's not --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- this case, but don't we have to have some means of determining where this thing is in order to satisfy the nexus requirement of this statute? Because, other than that, you would have a situation in which all that needed to be proved, I guess, is that at one point 75 years ago, this property was taken by this country or, you know -- and there we are.\r\n\r\nUnless you can show that they currently -- it is in the United States or is owned by the company today -- or by the foreign state today, I don't know how you satisfy this jurisdictional hook and I don't know how you prove that without some sort of tracing.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nSo I think you do have to show that it is either in the United States or is owned today --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\n-- by --by the instrumentality.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nThat comes from the statute.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nAs for tracing, I think, in the context of money, which, again, is fungible, whatever tracing requirement there might be is satisfied by the --the very fact of commingling.\r\n\r\nAnd this takes me back to some of the earlier discussion with the Chief Justice and with Justice Thomas.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nSo you're saying that every dollar from -- for 75 years that was in the bank accounts of Hungary counts for the purpose of knowing that that's where this money is?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nFor -- for purposes of establishing the jurisdictional hook, yes, and --and that is, again, because Hungary's bank accounts were increased by X dollars of value as a result of the expropriated property being put in there.\r\n\r\nHungary, therefore, has that much more.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut, if it was a painting in the museum that went in, was commingled with the other art, we can't exactly figure out which one it is or we don't know, you would say no jurisdiction? We have to know that they have the painting, it's --that there it is, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nWell, again, I think that's different in two respects.\r\n\r\nOne is that the painting's not fungible, so you've got to identify that particular painting.\r\n\r\nDollars are fungible.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether I give you $10 or whether I give you two fives; it's the same thing.\r\n\r\nThat's one distinction.\r\n\r\nThe other distinction is, again, so it's a -- it's an unusual situation that you're positing, Judge, because even -- the painting goes into the art museum.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have security cameras around the art museum.\r\n\r\nWe know it never left.\r\n\r\nNobody ever took it out. But we can't find it in the museum.\r\n\r\nI don't know, it's behind a couch somewhere.\r\n\r\nIt's in the basement.\r\n\r\nWould you say that it is still there? I -- I think you would.\r\n\r\nBut, again, that's far removed from this case, where we're dealing with fungible property, and the key point is, once the money is commingled, we know that it's there because the account value is increased by the amount of that money.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nCan I ask about the foreign policy implications? Because I think we --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- need to account for those.\r\n\r\nSo no other country in the world has an expropriation exception to begin with, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nThat's right.\r\n\r\nAnd Congress was aware of that when it passed this one.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut doesn't that fact and the out of compliance with international law -- suppose we have a choice, you can interpret the exception more narrowly or more broadly.\r\n\r\nMore broadly pushes us further out of compliance with international law -- this is what the Solicitor General says -- furthers friction with foreign countries because we can forget, it's a big deal to hale a foreign country into a U.S. court, and also increases the risk of reciprocal actions against the United States in foreign countries abroad.\r\n\r\nSo, you know, do we assume Congress meant to do all that, or, you know, is it, as the Solicitor General says, more prudent to choose the narrower interpretation of it so as not to cause all those ramifications?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nSo two points, Judge.\r\n\r\nOne, I think you should assume that Congress intended to do something when it passed the expropriation exception.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Justice Kagan's question --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut -- but even just doing the narrow -- Sabbatino is doing something.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nIt's doing very, very little.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nBut it's something.\r\n\r\nAnd -- and they said -- and they recognized that it was narrow, that it was recognized at the time, but -- and keep going, though.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nWell, so I think you may be referring to the Katzenbach legislative history --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\n-- testimony, which -- which I'm happy to address, but if I could also just finish the point to your earlier question?\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nKeep going, yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nIn addition to giving this exception some meaning, it is already a narrow exception in light of Philipp.\r\n\r\nThat already significantly cuts down the class of claims that can be brought.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, as I was saying earlier, you have to actually establish commingling and liquidation, which is not something that you're typically going to be able to do.\r\n\r\nSo these are not claims that can be easily brought, but this is the rare case in which they can.\r\n\r", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "735", "dialogue": "Defendant’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI think it may be helpful for me to lay out how the federal government sees this case. In our view, the Court has already found, as indicated in $8,850 and Von Neumann, that the only process a claimant is entitled to after personal property is seized is a timely final forfeiture hearing.\nIf this Court is of the view that it has not yet addressed that issue, it should now. And it should hold that a claimant has no right to an interim post-seizure hearing.\n\nHistory and tradition support that rule. At the time of the founding, there was no right to an early hearing when property was seized. Only a timely forfeiture hearing was required. That approach has prevailed for nearly 250 years.\n\nThe hearings that Petitioners request would upend that history, be extremely onerous, and would require more process for the pretrial deprivation of property than the pretrial detention of persons.\n\nFinally, if the government disagrees with our front-line position, while we think that $8,850 is the better fit for Petitioners' particular claims, the government is largely ambivalent about whether Eldridge or $8,850 applies to determine whether an interim hearing is required in a given case.\n\nBut, either way, this Court's decision should emphasize that the public and government interests identified in $8,850 and Pearson Yacht will often weigh strongly against allowing such a hearing.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: There have been quite a few questions suggesting that maybe something substantively goes wrong in this process. How would you address that, assuming that the forfeiture proceedings are timely?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think if there was some sort of question that an individual wasn't receiving due process in the course of the proceedings, some sort of procedural irregularity, there could be a due process claim for that.\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily be governed by Eldridge or even $8,850. It could be governed by just the closest civil law analogy. For example, if an inappropriate burden of proof were placed on someone, there might be due process concerns.\n\nBut that wouldn't be solved by requiring an additional layer of proceedings in all cases or in a significant category of cases. That's just a different issue.\n\nJudge: The assessment of whether a civil forfeiture proceeding meets the requirements of due process—timeliness is a significant consideration in that, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: And it is, of course, in retention as well?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: So there's presumably a gap between when you would have that question asked under retention and when you would have it asked under civil forfeiture. How do we look at the significance of that gap?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think the Court would look at that under $8,850 because $8,850 allows the Court to take into consideration the burden to a particular claimant in a particular case. I think that comes in under the first factor in $8,850.\n\nAnd I think the government interests really aren't any different. This Court has talked about the government's interests in Pearson Yacht in not having a pre-seizure hearing. And I think most of those government interests continue to apply to allow the government to retain the property while the hearing is proceeding—so long as the hearing is proceeding in an appropriate amount of time and the government isn't sitting on its hands and doing nothing while holding someone's property.\n\nAnd I think the history and tradition really are consistent with that. The best evidence of the history here comes from the Collection Acts, which were passed by founding-era Congresses. There was no requirement for any sort of interim hearing. The normal rule was that once property was seized, it was held until the final forfeiture hearing.\n\nAnd Petitioners' counsel has suggested that once the forfeiture proceeding was filed, there was a 14-day hearing requirement. That's just not the case. Under the Collection Acts, the federal government had up to three years between seizure and initiating the forfeiture action.\n\nJudge: Sorry to interrupt. Do we need to decide any of that in this case, given that under your count and the state's, the Petitioner here could have brought a summary judgment motion at any time? And presumably, most of the facts that she would have wanted to present would have been in her control.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think that's right.

{"id": "254", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, you never really got a chance to answer the second part of my question about standing. Could you address that? What sense does it make to say the plaintiff wins on voluntary cessation because you can't prove that it's very unlikely that he will be put back on if he does some additional thing, but on standing, he will be unable to show, as required by precedent, that he has standing for purposes of injunctive relief because he can't show that he's under an imminent threat?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I agree completely. He's not going to be able to show what's required to get injunctive relief. And, as we point out in our opening brief, the plaintiff seems to have abandoned the argument. He's not going to be able to get a declaration either because a declaration has to be forward-looking, and at the moment, there is no live case or controversy. So even if you were to say that the case isn't moot, I don't think he would be entitled to any relief at the end of the day, which I think just underscores why the case is moot. I mean, mootness and standing are both attempts to implement Article III's case or controversy requirement. I understand that mootness is a little more relaxed than standing, but both of the exceptions that make it a little more relaxed are all about evading review, either because the challenged action by its nature is so evanescent that ordinary judicial review won't complete or because of docket manipulation and gamesmanship.\n\nJudge: Well, is the upshot of what you've said that Article III can't be satisfied in this case unless the basis for putting him on in the first place and taking him off later is disclosed at least to the judge? And so that's what this is all about. I'll ask opposing counsel whether that's his understanding. Are we going to say that this sensitive information that you don't want to disclose has to be disclosed in any case in which somebody who has been on the No Fly List wants to contest that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, and that's precisely what we're trying to avoid here. And we think this is exactly the kind of circumstance where the presumption of regularity in national security does play a role in that evaluation of facts. Now a court could look at all the classified evidence and then determine whether it's likely to recur or not, or can just hold as a matter of law that the government is fulfilling its national security responsibilities in good faith, it's evaluating people against the standard correctly, and even if the allegation is that it didn't do that at time one, we cannot reasonably expect the government to fall down and act in bad faith at time two.\n\nJudge: Justice, do you have any questions?\n\nJudge: I think you're right that he's given up an injunction, but he wants a declaration. You don't think a declaration that said he attended a mosque and that wasn't enough to put him on the list would help so that he could go back to the same mosque?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. A declaration wouldn't presumably reveal classified information, but—\n\nJudge: It wouldn't. But it would basically say whatever ground that the court has looked at wasn't sufficient to put him on the list, so if he repeats that conduct, he won't be put at risk.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, again, we think the declaration actually tells him that he's not going to be put back on the list—\n\nJudge: No, because—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —based on the currently available information.\n\nJudge: —we can go back to the fundraising. But, anyway.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, but—\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you, counsel.\n\nJudge: Is the government able to say anything about how this relisting occurs or, more particularly, about how often it occurs? In other words, are you capable of telling us anything about when you're taken off a list, how often is somebody put back on a list?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Unfortunately, I can't tell you that information. I don't have it. I would have to imagine that in the 20-some years the No Fly List has been in existence, surely there have been some individuals who were at one time listed, removed, and then listed again. I'm unaware of any claim for the litigated cases, and there are several dozen of them. I'm unaware of any claim there of someone who was on the list, taken off the list, and then put back on. That is just not something that we have seen in, again, years and years of this kind of litigation.\n\nJudge: And the possibility of just going before a judge in camera—has the government ever thought that that's a possible way to figure this difficult problem out? You know, you're not disclosing it to the world. You tell the judge, here's what got him on the list. Here's why we think he's not going back on the list.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah. So, obviously, we've done that in the cases we've taken to judgment, but that's been on the merits. So I gather your question is, well, what if it's just for the limited purpose of mootness.\n\nJudge: Yeah. In other words, you're saying that he hasn't satisfied the standard. It's not going to recur again. He's saying, I don't know. It seems like it might recur again because I don't know why you took me off the list. You go to the judge and you say, judge, here's why he was on the list, here's why he's not on the list anymore, here's why we don't think he's going back on the list.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That that's just unlikely to happen.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "812", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is the third time the government has come before this Court and asked to be relieved of the consequences of flouting the plain text of the INA. For a third time, the government says the notice it gave is good enough. Just as it did in previous cases, this Court should reject the government’s argument here. Indeed, the government's position in these cases is more extreme than before.\n\nIn a prior case, the government argued that as long as the non-citizen received all the information listed in paragraph (1), the format did not matter. In these cases, the government now seems to argue that if a paragraph (2) notice is given, it does not matter if the non-citizen never receives the information in paragraph (1).\n\nTo illustrate, imagine a scenario where the government sends a non-citizen a blank piece of paper but provides the immigration judge with details about the charges against them. In that circumstance, the government may prove removability by clear and convincing evidence, while the non-citizen remains unaware of the charges. In a previous case, the argument was that a deficient NTA could still stop the clock for discretionary relief; here, the government argues that the same deficient NTA is enough to remove a non-citizen without allowing them to present their case.\n\nBecause the statute does not allow for such an outcome, and because it requires a complete and valid paragraph (1) notice in every case while treating paragraph (2) notice only as a supplement, this Court should reject the government's arguments again. I welcome this Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: What’s your best textual argument for your last point?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, we believe there are two main textual arguments. The first concerns the centrality of the NTA. The statute requires that it be issued in every removal proceeding, includes key information not found in paragraph (2), and states that a hearing cannot be held less than 10 days from the issuance of an NTA. This establishes a presumption in favor of the NTA.\n\nThe second argument comes from the language of 1229 paragraph (2), which states that a notice of change must be given only when there is a change in the time and place of the proceeding. The combination of these two points— the importance of the NTA and the interpretation of \"change\"—supports our position.\n\nJudge: I think the statute says \"any change,\" and that language seems broad enough to cover the change here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, that \"any change\" language was interpreted in a prior case, and we do not believe it is broad enough to apply here. Consider the example from the government’s reply brief about voter registration. If a person fills out an invalid voter registration form, no number of party affiliation change forms will correct that. Until the voter registration form is valid, any subsequent changes are meaningless. The same applies here. Because the initial NTA was invalid due to the \"TBD\" language, later notices cannot correct that deficiency. Until a valid NTA is issued, there is nothing to change.\n\nJudge: Could I clarify something? Suppose the non-citizen receives a paragraph (1) notice, and there is no issue with the date and time, but the government omits details about the charges or the right to counsel. Later, a paragraph (2) notice is issued because the date and time need to change. Could the non-citizen reopen the case?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, Your Honor, and that’s for the reason I just articulated. In this case, the issue with the \"change\" language is twofold. First, we argue that changing from \"TBD\" to a specific date is not actually a change. Second, the statute specifies that changes pertain to the time and place of the proceeding. If there was never a valid NTA setting a time and place, then there is nothing to change.\n\nJudge: I’m assuming there was no problem with the time and date in the first notice. There was an issue with something else, like the charges or the right to counsel. Would the non-citizen still have a right to reopen?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. Returning to the voter registration analogy—if the initial document is invalid due to missing required information, simply filing a change notice does not remedy that. The NTA is invalid if it lacks required information from paragraph (1), meaning it does not function properly. A proper, valid NTA must be issued before any changes can be made.\n\nJudge: So your position is that there is simply no NTA, meaning paragraph (2) does not apply?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s correct, Your Honor. In this case, the issue is further reinforced by the \"TBD\" date and the previous Court ruling interpreting similar language.\n\nJudge: Do you dispute that, in ordinary language, a change can occur from an indeterminate time or place to a determinate one?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. We believe that ordinary speakers do not use \"change\" to describe moving from an undefined time to a defined one. For example, if a bride announces she is getting married but does not specify a date, when she later sends out a card with the date, it is called a \"Save the Date\" rather than a \"Change the Date.\"\n\nJudge: But if a friend asks the bride for the date, and she responds that she doesn’t know yet, and the friend later says, \"Let me know if there’s any change,\" do you think that is an unusual use of language?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I don’t know if it’s completely unreasonable, but when combined with the precedent from prior cases and the structural importance of the NTA in this statute, our interpretation of \"change\" is the stronger one.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "862", "dialogue": "Judge: That's the point, isn't it? I -- I can't get over the fact that what Congress did in 1367 was address the questions that had been in the Court.\n\nThe first one was the diversity issue under St. Paul, and it agreed with the Court.\n\nIt disagreed with the Court on pendent and supplemental jurisdiction, and it wrote a statute to address that.\n\nAnd yet it knew from Cahill that we had said that if a plaintiff dismisses an action, that potentially we go back to the original amendment, and it didn't do what it did for diversity.\n\nIt wrote it to say only when the district court dismisses the federal claims do you retain supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nThat, to me, is the statute.\n\nThey had all our case law.\n\nThey addressed one -- one thing they agreed with.\n\nThey disagreed with another, and they disagreed with the third by not adopting what it did with diversity.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So two responses, Your Honor.\n\nFirst, Section (3) --(c)(2) does express -- expressly address this Cohill situation.\n\nIt says the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction when the state law claim substantially predominates.\n\nJudge: No, when the district court has dismissed all claims.\n\nIt doesn't say when the plaintiff has dismissed all claims.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So I agree, that's (c)(3).\n\nJudge: And when the district court dismisses all federal claims, the party still has a right to appeal, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's correct.\n\nJudge: When the district court doesn't do that in a diverse action, then that -- because the claim has disappeared, there's no appeal for the defendant -- for the -- for -- for anybody, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I sort of -- I think, Your Honor, it depends on the case.\n\nI think there could still be an appeal in a diversity case where the district court dismisses a claim and the plaintiff says you shouldn't have dismissed that claim.\n\nJudge: No, but that's because they're there because of the -- the diversity provision of the statute.\n\nJudge: Can I just understand your argument about whether or not an amendment can affect federal question jurisdiction? So setting aside diversity for a second, we're in federal question land.\n\nThe case is filed in federal court.\n\nAnd the plaintiff goes through the first couple weeks and then says: You know what? I'm dropping my federal claims, because it originally brought a complaint that had federal and state claims.\n\nDoes that affect jurisdiction in your view or not?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And this is a case originally brought --\n\nJudge: Originally brought --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- in federal court?\n\nJudge: -- originally brought in federal court.\n\nAnd the plaintiff amends and takes out the federal claims.\n\nCan the court proceed, can it decide through supplemental jurisdiction or whatnot to continue on with the case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So this Court suggested in Rockwell that the answer to that would be no, you would not continue in that case.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nSo next question.\n\nYou -- the case is brought in state court and it has federal and state claims, and before the defendant has the ability to remove, the plaintiff says: Oops, I didn't mean to bring the federal claims, I'm dropping them.\n\nSo no removal action yet or motion yet. Can it be still removed? Is there any basis for federal jurisdiction in that situation?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nSo it seems to me then your argument comes down to the impact of removal because somehow, even though in a situation in which the plaintiff amends, if it was brought originally in federal court or amends if it's brought originally in state court, those have an impact, you say, on federal question jurisdiction.\n\nSomehow, if the defendant removes before the plaintiff can drop the federal claims, you say no impact on federal question jurisdiction.\n\nIs that right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So this Court explained in St. Paul Mercury that once you've removed to federal court, there is a removal statute and the defendants have a right to remove.\n\nJudge: But the removal statute doesn't say, as I think the Court was trying to get at, anything about what happens to jurisdiction.\n\nI thought the removal statute was really just giving the defendant the ability to bring this action into federal court.\n\nIt doesn't say anything about whether or not the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction once it's there.\n\nAnd I don't understand why the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction if it starts in federal court because the plaintiff brought it -- brought it there but can't be divested of jurisdiction if it comes to federal court because the defendant brought it there.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And -- and just to be clear, the rule that we're asking for and the rule that this Court has applied for a hundred years is that it's a matter of discretion once you get to federal court on removal.\n\nIt's up to the district court judge.\n\nJudge: On removal.\n\nBut I guess why -- why does it make a difference as to how this case landed in federal court as to whether or not the federal judge can be divested of his jurisdiction? That's what your argument seems to turn on, and I don't know why that's the case.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And this Court addressed that in St. Paul Mercury and said that the defendant's right to remove should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice.\n\nCongress gave defendants rights in the situation when the case gets to federal court on removal.\n\nThat's different than when a case is originally --\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

{"id": "647", "dialogue": "Judge: So I'm just still wondering if your theory about this provision might be too narrow in a sense because you've got evidence going and spoliation in a sense. What I’m trying to work out in my mind is whether you would still have a decent argument if this 1512 language is read to prohibit the corrupt tampering with things that are used to conduct an official proceeding with the intent of undermining the integrity of the thing or access to the thing and thereby obstructing the proceeding. It’s not just evidence. It’s a proceeding. (c)(1) is an example of, you know, the corrupt tampering with certain things. And (c)(2) broadens it out a bit. It’s not just documents and records. What do you think about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think that’s a correct reading, Your Honor. I mean, as 1512(f) demonstrates, it doesn’t—1512(f) we would submit actually supports our position because it says the evidence need not be admissible or free of a privilege claim. Now what would that mean about what the statute is addressing if it’s not evidence? But (c)(2) has been applied, and occasionally (c)(1) has been applied.\n\nJudge: In a non-evidentiary way?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, to things that could become evidence, to the efforts to shape someone’s grand jury testimony.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: To answers to interrogatories.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you about the question that was asked earlier. You suggested that it has to be to the document, but—in other words, the activity has to be actually to the document, but I don’t know why that’s the case under (c)(2). Justice Alito says, well, one of the commonalities between (c)(1) and (c)(2) could be the impairment of the object’s integrity or availability. Justice Barrett posits a scenario in which you have someone who is impairing the availability by doing something to prevent the object from getting to the proceeding. Why wouldn’t that count under (c)(2)? So this is—this is, you know, preventing Congress from counting the electoral votes, for example. Let’s say it’s being done. She says it’s in an envelope going to the— the vice president’s desk and someone does something to impair or prevent that from happening. Why isn’t that what (c)(2) could cover?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, first, it’s not affecting the integrity of the document, Your Honor, or—the—\n\nJudge: Availability is also in the statute.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Availability it says too, but, as I mentioned earlier, simply delaying the arrival of evidence at the courthouse—\n\nJudge: No, not delay. Let’s say the person steals the envelope and takes it away.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Then it gets harder, I agree. If they steal the envelope, they take it away, they rip it up, all of those things, which is certainly not what happened here, and it’s not in the indictment, the—the ballots or the—the vote count is not even in the indictment.\n\nJudge: Well, we wouldn’t have to decide that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: We could send it back if we clarified that that is what the statute means. I’m trying to understand if you agree that that’s what the statute could mean.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I don’t agree that that’s what the statute could mean.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The reason is that if you look at 1512, it is about a direct effect or, in some senses, an indirect effect but in a limited way on evidence that’s to be used in a proceeding, right, and—and \"proceeding,\" as I mentioned earlier—\n\nJudge: So as to limit its availability.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So as to limit—\n\nJudge: I’m suggesting is, in (c)(2), if you’re doing something to limit its— to—to limit its availability, why doesn’t it count?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because we’re limiting the availability of its use by a fact finder in a proceeding. Again, that’s the way to marry 1519, which covers all kinds of investigations and all kinds of other events, with 1512. 1512 is talking about evidence that’s going to a formal convocation, some kind of hearing, before the Congress or before any other body—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: General, please proceed.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On January 6th, 2021, a violent mob stormed the United States Capitol and disrupted the peaceful transition of power. Many crimes occurred that day, but in plain English, the fundamental wrong committed by many of the rioters, including Petitioner, was a deliberate attempt to stop the joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election. That is, they obstructed Congress’s work in that proceeding. The government accordingly charged Petitioner with violating Section 1512(c)(2), an obstruction offense that directly reads onto his conduct. The case as it comes to this Court presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Did Petitioner obstruct, influence, or impede the joint session of Congress? The answer is equally straightforward. Yes, he obstructed that official proceeding. The terms of the statute unambiguously encompass his conduct. Petitioner doesn’t really argue that his actions fall outside the plain meaning of what it is to obstruct. Instead, he asks this Court to impose an atextual limit on the actus reus. In his view, because Section 1512(c)(1) covers tampering with documents and other physical evidence, the separate prohibition in Section 1512(c)(2) should be limited to acts of evidence impairment. But that limit has no basis in the text or tools of construction. His reading hinges on the word \"otherwise,\" but that word means in a different manner, not in the same manner. And the two prohibitions in Section 1512(c)(2) aren’t unified items on a list where you could apply associated words canons. They’re separate provisions. They have their own sets of verbs and their own nouns. They each independently prohibit attempts, which would be duplication that makes no sense on Petitioner’s reading. And Congress included a distinct mental state requirement in (c)(1) that it chose not to repeat in (c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) by its terms is not limited to evidence impairment. Instead, it’s a classic catchall. (c)(1) covers specified acts that obstruct an official proceeding, and (c)(2) covers all other acts that obstruct an official proceeding in a different manner. The Court should say so and allow this case to proceed to trial. I welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: General, there have been many violent protests that have interfered with proceedings. Has the government applied this provision to other protests in the past, and has this been the government's position throughout the lifespan of this statute?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It has certainly been the government's position since the enactment of 1512(c)(2) that it covers the myriad forms of obstructing an official proceeding and that it's not limited to some kind of evidence impairment gloss.\n\nJudge: Have you—so have you—have you enforced it in that manner?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We have enforced it in a variety of prosecutions that don’t focus on evidence tampering. Now I can’t give you an example of enforcing it in a situation where people have violently stormed a building in order to prevent an official proceeding, a specified one, from occurring with all of the elements like intent to obstruct, knowledge of the proceeding, having the corruptly mens rea, but that’s just because I’m not aware of that circumstance ever happening prior to January 6th. But just to give you flavor—you a flavor of some of the other circumstances where we have prosecuted under this provision, for example, there are situations where we’ve brought (c)(2) charges because someone tipped off the subject of an investigation to the grand jury's hearings. There was another case where someone tipped off about the identity of an undercover law enforcement officer. And in those situations, there’s no specific evidence, no, you know, concrete testimony or physical evidence that the conduct is interfering with. Instead, it’s more general obstruction of the proceeding.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "353", "dialogue": "Judge: It's much broader than that, Your Honor.\n\nSo judicial efficiency is a very important reason why Congress enacted the Gibbs principles into Section 1367.\n\nSo a case may be pending for two or three years.\n\nThe district court might be really familiar with it.\n\nIt might be a really straightforward question of state law.\n\nIn that situation --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So how doesn't Rule 15 take care of that? It gives plaintiffs a narrow window to amend and, otherwise, it needs to seek permission.\n\nSo why didn't the district court simply deny permission here?\n\nJudge: This case was pending almost two years before the amendment was made, but it was still an amendment as of right in this case.\n\nSo you can have an amendment --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It wasn't within the window permitted by the rule.\n\nJudge: It was, Your Honor, because the case went up on appeal and came down.\n\nSo there are situations like that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I see.\n\nJudge: But there's also -- you know, leave to amend should be freely given under Rule 15.\n\nThat's not really the kind of standard that takes into account these judicial efficiencies, comity --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Oh, it certainly does.\n\nI mean, that's the entire purpose of the freedom -- of the power and discretion to amend. So I just think, as a matter of first principles, it's -- it's really -- you have an amici, the Center for Litigation and Courts, who supports your argument but says don't rely on that.\n\nAnd I think they make that point for a reason.\n\nIt's not your strongest point.\n\nAnd then I don't understand why we should change all the other rules that respect an amended complaint as the complaint setting forth the claims in an action.\n\nJudge: Your Honor, we think, if you were to rule for the other side, that would be upsetting a hundred years of precedent, every single court of appeals decision.\n\nThat would be changing the rules.\n\nAll we ask this Court to do here is apply settled law.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We talked a lot about 1367, but I'm not sure we paid much attention yet to 1447.\n\nAnd I -- I can certainly see the argument that the operative complaint should be the one at the time of removal under the old version of 1447, which suggests that a case should be remanded if it was improvidently removed.\n\nThat -- that does seem to focus the Court's attention on the complaint at the time of removal.\n\nAnd I think a lot of the court of appeals kind of have been operating under that kind of idea of the rule.\n\nBut it's been amended, and it now reads that -- that a case should be remanded if at any time it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which, you know, just reading that, one might -- and I'm sure we're going to hear this argument, so I wanted to give you a chance to respond to it before you sit down -- that that focuses the Court's attention on --on the then-operative complaint.\n\nThoughts?\n\nJudge: Two responses, Your Honor.\n\nSo I think it's important to keep in mind that the 1911 version of the statute, the predecessor of 1447 that was in effect during St. Paul Mercury, had basically the same text as it did today.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I grant -- I grant you that.\n\nAnd then it went to was improvidently removed --\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- for a very long time.\n\nAnd now it's come back to looking more directly at the -- the then-operative complaint, doesn't it?\n\nJudge: So I think it is important that this Court reached the ruling that it did in St. Paul Mercury under the old text.\n\nI think that suggests that it --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I grant you that --\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- with respect to the amount in controversy.\n\nWe've been around that --that tree a few times. So putting aside that point, have you got anything else you want to say about it?\n\nJudge: Certainly. So they didn't make that argument in the red brief because it doesn't answer the question.\n\nThe question is whether the federal court has jurisdiction or not.\n\nWe think that's answered at the time of removal.\n\nAnd this Court, in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections case, said that Section 1447 was merely procedural.\n\nIt did not affect the district court's jurisdiction.\n\nSo I think you would have to revisit that case in order to read 1447 here the way you suggest.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay.\n\nThank you.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nDefendant: I just want to make sure on the state of the law, and maybe following up on Justice Kagan's question, because you would think when you pick this up, if you were uninitiated, that there would be a standard rule.\n\nLook at the complaint at the time of filing or removal, or look at the complaint at the time of amendment.\n\nBut at least as I looked at everything, it's just a mess, right?

Is that correct?\n\nJudge: That's correct, Your Honor.\n\nThere --\n\nDefendant: Like Morgan's Heirs and St. Paul Mercury on the one hand and Owen Equipment on the other, there's no logic connecting those things at least as I see it.\n\nJudge: I --\n\nDefendant: They were just rules out there without connective logic.\n\nThere might be --each box has its own little idiosyncratic policy considerations, but there's no connective rule at least as I read it.

And you talked about why you shouldn't think of these as forfeited.\r\n\r\nI mean, it's at least true that the courts below did not address these.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not sure that we had it in our minds when we took the case that this was the issue.\r\n\r\nSo what, if anything, would you say to that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I would say that the issue defined at the right level -- and I'm defining it as the text of the statute defines it -- is whether there was discrimination against a qualified individual.\r\n\r\nI do understand the Court to have granted cert on that question.\r\n\r\nThen it's just a matter of the fact that these arguments, while they were pressed below not only by us but by the Plaintiff, weren't addressed below.\r\n\r\nBut I've always understood that pressed or passed-upon requirement to apply to issues and not arguments but also to be phrased in the injunctive such that if you did want to apply that test to the precise arguments here, it would be satisfied because these arguments were pressed below.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Any further questions?\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, I thought we were deciding whether the Eleventh Circuit's understanding of the law was correct given the arguments that it considered.\r\n\r\nIs that not what we -- you don't think that's what we should do?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think the Eleventh Circuit found various ways to reject the arguments that go to the overarching issue.\r\n\r\nSome of those ways of rejecting those arguments did involve addressing those arguments on the merits, and others involved determining that they were forfeited.\r\n\r\nBut I think all of that is before this Court.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: Any further questions?\r\n\r\nJudge: So I just wanted to clarify the conversation that you had with the other Judge about whether the elements of disparate treatment have been plausibly alleged here.\r\n\r\nThat -- you don't consider that to be within the question presented in this case?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We do not.\r\n\r\nJudge: So it's more like whether or not the Plaintiff's status as a former employee precludes them from making this claim? I mean, I thought at the bottom of all of this we're talking about a motion to dismiss in which the City claimed that the Plaintiff was not allowed to go forward because they were a former employee.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: And you're saying the Plaintiff is because there's evidence that they were discriminated against, evidence, not -- it hasn't -- whether it's proven or not, evidence that they were discriminated against during the period of their employment, and that should be enough to allow for their case to go forward?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That should be enough.\r\n\r\nWe think even if they couldn't have pointed to that existence of discrimination while they were employed that they would still have a claim, like many others do in other situations, where they cannot point to a precise moment in time in which they were both qualified and disabled.\r\n\r\nBut I'll acknowledge that those are trickier issues, and this Court's usual practice is not to decide issues more broadly than it needs to.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nNext speaker.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "201", "dialogue": "Judge: General, so I want to go back to the discussion about content discrimination and we're going to shut Joe up. Here, it seems to me like we are saying to ByteDance we want to shut you up.\n\nJudge: And so let's say that I think that that is content discrimination based on speaker.\n\nJudge: Tell me -- if -- if I think that, tell me if I have to conclude that it is also speaker-based discrimination and content-based discrimination for TikTok.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: No, it is not, and the reason for that is because it would be an anomalous principle to say that an entity outside the United States that can't assert its own First Amendment rights can somehow manufacture that right through the expediency of forming a U.S. subsidiary, especially one that it wholly controls.\n\nJudge: So you don't have to stand on that argument that you were having with Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch to still have your point about content discrimination?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: That's right.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I think, if you're focusing in on the relevant U.S. entities here, TikTok U.S. and the users themselves, this Act isn't regulating them in any way.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's not trying to dictate the algorithm that TikTok U.S. can use.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And, in fact, Congress, I think, was doing everything it could to preserve access to TikTok in the United States, in recognition that Americans enjoy expressing themselves and building community on the site.\n\nJudge: One last quick question --\n\nJudge: Well, I don't know, General --\n\nJudge: Sorry, just one last quick question.\n\nJudge: No, no, go ahead.\n\nJudge: Justice Gorsuch had asked your friends on the other side whether the new administration on January 20th could extend the deadline.\n\nJudge: What's the -- your position on that?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So I think it tees up a statutory interpretation question of whether there can be an extension after the time period for divestiture has lapsed.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I would think the Court might start with its decision in the HollyFrontier case, which did recognize the ability to get an extension after a lapse like that.\n\nJudge: So it's your position that they could?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: We have not run it to ground, in part, because it's simply not presented here, and I'm not prepared to take a position on that statutory interpretation question.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I do want to emphasize, though, that my friends have pointed to January 19th or nine days from now as a moment when TikTok might go dark.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: At the outset, of course, Congress was hoping to prompt a divestiture, but I think the more important thing to -- to focus on now is that even if that were to happen, Congress specifically anticipated it and provided authority to lift these restrictions as soon as there's a qualified divestiture.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And the reason for that is because foreign adversaries do not willingly give up their control over this mass communications channel in the United States, and I think Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken, ByteDance saying we can't do it; China will never let us do it.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: But, when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider, and it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.\n\nJudge: Well, that's --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So it's not irrevocable.\n\nJudge: That -- that's an interesting point, and I hope Mr. Francisco or Mr. Fisher, whoever's delivering the rebuttal, will address it.\n\nJudge: So, if we were to affirm and TikTok were forced to cease operations on January 19th, you say that there could be divestiture after that point and TikTok could again begin to operate the way -- continue to operate?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: That's exactly right.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: There's nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens on January 19th.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I think that Congress might have thought that we get in a situation here where a foreign adversary is doing whatever it can to just not comply.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's hoping the United States is going to blink first through our court system or through the executive branch getting cold feet about enforcing the law.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: But Congress set a deadline and I think it thought that deadline would have a forcing function.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you a question about your -- your effort to draw a distinction between ByteDance's speech and TikTok's speech.\n\nJudge: So suppose that the -- the People's Republic of China funds a movie and -- and there is an entity in the United States, a U.S. corporation, that thinks, wow, this is a great movie.\n\nJudge: And while the PRC would not have a First Amendment right to show it in the United States, would you say that the American company would not have a First Amendment right to do that because whatever expression there is in that movie, it's the PRC's expression; it's not their expression?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: No.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: No, I wouldn't make that argument.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I want to be really careful --\n\nJudge: I thought that was the argument that was being made.\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: No.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So our argument is that this is not a direct regulation of protected speech in the first place, or at most, it would warrant intermediate scrutiny because of the indirect effects that it might have on the American users or on the U.S. subsidiary.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: We're not suggesting that if Congress sought to directly regulate and prohibit speech in the United States based on concerns about its content or viewpoint, that's somehow immune from First Amendment scrutiny just because it comes from a foreign source.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Obviously, that kind of law is going to trigger strict scrutiny.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I imagine it would be a different constitutional analysis because it's hard to imagine the same profound national security harms that would exist in that scenario as compared to what we have here.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: General, isn't the whole point of the divestiture requirement that the content on TikTok would be different if it was owned by a different company? I'm still struggling with your insistence that this is content-neutral versus content-based when we have that kind of circumstance.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: The reason that I am continuing to try to hold the line on that is because there is nothing in the Act that would directly dictate any different mix of content on TikTok.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: The U.S. subsidiary could use the same algorithm, show the same content by the same users in exactly the same order.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's not about trying to interfere with the U.S. subsidiary's exercise of editorial judgment in any relevant sense.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Instead, all Congress was doing was homing in on the problems of having a foreign adversary be able to interject itself and be able to harvest the data or exercise --\n\nJudge: But your friends on the other side say that the motivation for doing that is because the foreign adversary might influence or change the content.\n\nJudge: So content is -- I mean, content matters, doesn't it?\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I -- certainly, I think that content was relevant to Congress's concern about an adversary having control over the communications channel.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I think not, again, because of any particular concern about viewpoints or subjects --\n\nJudge: But isn't that relevance --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer: -- but just that this would be a --\n\nJudge: -- isn't that relevance enough to trigger at least some scrutiny, a heightened scrutiny, from the standpoint of our legal tests?\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Even that wouldn't be enough.\n\nAnd I guess I wonder why. I certainly understand—this is kind of a first principles question. I certainly understand the clear statement rule this Court has developed to protect the Eleventh Amendment and state sovereign immunity, separate sovereigns.\n\nBut, here, we have the sovereign itself speaking, right? It's not waiving someone else's immunity. It's not purporting to strip another entity of its protections under the Constitution. It's Congress, which has control over the federal fisc, itself deciding. And so I wonder why the clear statement rule would be appropriate in those circumstances.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So two answers to that, Judge. The first is that Respondent's argument has exactly the same effect in terms of Congress's meaning as to states and in terms of its effect as to Indian tribes and foreign nations. If you rule against the United States here, you will necessarily be saying that it waived sovereign immunity for them too.\n\nJudge: You're just fighting my question. I'm saying it is different. It is one thing to waive a tribe, a state, a foreign government's immunity. Congress purporting to exercise that power under the Constitution is an extraordinary power. It's permissible sometimes, but, generally, we think of it as inconsistent with the structure of our Constitution, and that's why we have traditionally required a clear statement rule.\n\nIt's less clear to me what justifications we have for requiring magic words to waive sovereign immunity when it's the sovereign itself opening itself up to suit.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So we, of course, don't think it's magic words, but that's not your question. This Court has repeatedly said that it applies the same standard when evaluating—\n\nJudge: I'm asking why.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So the Court has identified a number of justifications for—\n\nJudge: What do you think it's saying?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The clear statement. I'd combine two.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: First, as Federalist 81 said way back at the founding, it was well established then that the sovereign could not be haled into court without its consent.\n\nAnd, second, tracing all the way back to Blackstone, it was well settled that courts should not interpret statutes to apply to the sovereign unless that was the only permissible reading.\n\nAnd so, by the middle of the 19th century, courts had recognized that in light of those two principles, you couldn't read a congressional enactment to waive sovereign immunity unless that was the only plausible reading, and, of course, by now, this Court has repeated that so many times that it's a well-established background principle against which Congress legislates.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Just on the clear statement rule part of your argument, so that part, I mean, we said that sometimes the better interpretation of a statute will not necessarily prevail because of the clear statement rule.\n\nSo even assuming the interpretation of the statute is against you, the better interpretation, you can still prevail under the clear statement rule?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, that's absolutely right. We just need a—\n\nJudge: Okay. So that's the starting point. And then, for the why, you know, ultimately, it's money that Congress has the power to appropriate, right? And we want to be careful about that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, we think that's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. And that's basic separation of powers?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, absolutely.\n\nJudge: Okay. So how much would it cost here if you were to lose this case?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So we don't have a precise estimate of that, Judge. I will say that there is a case pending in the Seventh Circuit right now that's being held for this case in which the plaintiff has attempted to assert a class action.\n\nWe understand that the damages, if they were to prevail, would be in the millions of dollars. I don't know exactly what that would be, but Congress would have anticipated that the potential liability here would be significant, I think.\n\nJudge: And punitive damages too, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So we, of course, don't think those would be available. But I think, if you accepted that this is clear enough—\n\nJudge: If you accept their argument down the line, punitive damages could be available?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then, on Employees, you've mentioned that case. And that case seems structurally—I mean, I'm going to ask a lot to the other side about this—seems structurally similar to this statute, how this one developed.\n\nBut the other side basically says don't pay attention to Employees, and I think another Judge alluded to that, because it's old, a 1973 case. So I want your response to that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, I mean, first, we don't think this is how this Court treats precedents. Again, as I said, we think that this Court has reaffirmed Employees and recognized that Employees began the retreat from Parden, but even just looking at the text of Employees, I think it's consistent with the argument and the distinctions that I'm drawing today.\n\nThe Court there said that the cause of action by its literal terms covered state agencies, but it recognized that the relevant question was whether Congress had intended to bring the states to heel by lifting their immunity. So it recognized that was a distinct question, and then it said Congress wouldn't have done that silently.\n\nAnd, in particular, it said that if Congress had intended to do that, it would have done one of two things. It either would have addressed immunity expressly, or it would have amended the cause of action, and in that context, what that would have meant was adding a specific reference to state agencies to the cause of action.\n\nAnd because Congress hadn't done either of those things, the Court in Employees found there wasn't a clear waiver. We think the same thing is true here.\n\nJudge: So then, to pick up on another Judge's questions earlier, if you see Employees on one side of the line and you see cases like Kimel on the other side of the line, where the reference to the public entities is in the cause of action itself, that's slicing it pretty thin.\n\nLike, what sense does that make or what principle would undergird sticking to Employees in the way that you're advocating?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So I think, in the cases like Kimel, there's a superfluity argument that unless you hold that Congress has waived sovereign immunity, that text in the cause of action will do absolutely no work. And so the Court has said Congress wouldn't have effectively negated that and has been willing to infer a waiver of immunity.\n\nBut Respondent has conceded that our interpretation doesn't produce any superfluity here. So even if you think that probably members of Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity, there's no necessary implication that they must have. And under the clear statement rule and under Employees, that's enough to rule for us.\n\nJudge: Can you give me just one quick example of how it's not superfluous—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—\n\nJudge: —if you were to prevail here?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: \"Person\" would cover entities other than private parties that furnish information to those credit reporting agencies.\n\nJudge: No, the coverage of government, how the coverage of government wouldn't be superfluous even if you were to prevail here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So the coverage of government ensures that the government can obtain credit reports. I mean, the coverage of government was there before the cause of action, so the one thing we know is that the coverage of government is not there in order to allow recovery under the cause of action.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "976", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 23-334, Department of State versus Munoz.\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last fiscal year, the Department of State issued 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.\nIt also refused 62,000 visa applications on the basis of one or more of the inadmissibility grounds in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), including applications from approximately 5400 noncitizens seeking to live with their U.S. citizen spouses or fiancés.\n\nUnder the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the United States cannot obtain judicial review of a consular officer's denial of a visa.\nCongress has not provided for that form of review in the INA, and when it added new visa-related provisions in 2002, it reaffirmed that it was not providing an end run around that.\n\nNor is an end run available when a U.S. citizen family member—here, the noncitizen spouse—wants the noncitizen to be admitted into the United States.\nAs the Kerry v. Din plurality concluded in 2015, that is not a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, and the U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the government's action against the noncitizen.\n\nThus, the plaintiff cannot challenge the denial of her husband's visa application any more than she could challenge a decision at the end of a removal proceeding that he will be removed from the United States or at the end of a criminal trial that he would be sent to a prison far across the country.\n\nWith respect to the second question presented, even assuming that the plaintiff has a sufficient constitutional interest to trigger any judicial review, the Court should at the very least hold that the State Department satisfied the Mandel standard.\nThe consular officer provided a facially legitimate and bona fide reason by citing a valid statutory ground of inadmissibility, the unlawful activity bar, just as Justice Kennedy's concurrence had found had been the case in Din, where the government cited the neighboring terrorist activities bar.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Just for clarification, assuming that the plaintiff does, in fact, have a liberty interest, would the consular nonreviewability preclude her winning here?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We think that it would.\n\nJudge: And how would that work then?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The only potential exception there would be if there were a constitutional right that this Court has recognized, that that would be the only potential exception.\n\nWe otherwise think that the point here is—of consular nonreviewability is that the person whose interest is directly at stake doesn’t have a right to review.\n\nAnd, a fortiori, it seems that somebody who is only indirectly affected by the government’s decision in that proceeding also cannot challenge that.\n\nAnd so the second question presented, assuming that she has a constitutional interest, would be that we at least satisfy what—\n\nJudge: Well, I understand that.\nI’m just trying to figure, without even getting to Din, whether or not nonreviewability would preclude any—her having any recovery at all, whatsoever, that you wouldn’t even have to get to Din.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the case has been litigated on the presumption that there would be an exception to consular nonreviewability if—if we were to lose on the first question, and that’s what Justice Kennedy’s concurrence said in Din.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don’t know what the cause of action is—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —that she has in order to bring that.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has been assuming that there is one, I guess, under the Constitution.\nWe think there is not one under the APA.\n\nAnd none of the courts of appeals has found that there is one there.\nAnd so we think that there still would be reasons to say that there isn’t going to be any review even in those circumstances, but at the least, we would satisfy Mandel.\n\nJudge: Counsel, the husband has no right of review, you’re correct. And it’s a judicially created exception of nonreviewability.\n\nSo, if we make an exception, it’s us accepting something that’s not statutory or constitutionally required.\n\nHer point is, whether it’s her or her husband, they each should have a right to dispute whatever basis it was that formed your denial.\n\nAnd let’s assume it was something as simple as misidentification.\nYou thought he was John Doe, and you had a whole criminal record on John Doe.\n\nAnd he’s not John Doe; he’s John Smith, John Smith Doe, which is another person.\n\nSo the reason she’s asking for an explanation and one that’s required is that she says: I have a right equal to the Mandel professor’s.\n\nThey had a First Amendment right to invite a professor to come speak to them.\n\nI have an equal constitutional right to live with my husband if I can.\n\nThe second question is, is that a liberty interest? And you say it’s not.\n\nSo let’s take each of your points, okay? As far back as 1888, this Court said in Maynard that getting married is something more than a mere contract, which is your position in your brief, that it’s only statutory rights or benefits.\n\nIn 1923, this Court described in one breath the right “to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.”\n\nAnd that right is one long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. That’s our Meyer case.\n\nIn Loving v. Virginia, we said marriage is fundamental.\n\nIn United States v. Windsor, we said marriage is more than a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory benefits.\n\nSo—and Obergefell, I’m not going to cite it, but it said something to that effect.\n\nSo, if I assume that there’s a liberty interest that has to be protected by some sort of process, then the question is, what kind of process is enough?\n\nAnd in Mandel and in Nken, we talked about the statutory—citing at least a statutory basis for exclusion.\n\nHere, you’re saying she’s entitled to nothing.\n\nWhy do we have to go that far? Why don’t we just address, given all of our centuries of statements about marriage being something more?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We don’t disagree that marriage is an important right and that she has liberty interests that are implicated there.\n\nTo step back to the beginning of your question, we think that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability is rooted in the political branch’s plenary power to determine which noncitizens should be admitted to the country and what procedures are going to be used in order to make that determination.\n\nAnd so that’s not just a judicial exception to general principles of reviewability.\n\nThat’s the background against which Congress enacted the INA.\n\nIt provided for certain remedies in review and did not provide for this.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "140", "dialogue": "Judge:\nWe will hear argument first this term in Case 23-191, Williams versus Fitzgerald.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Patsy and Felder control this case. In Patsy, this Court held that a failure to exhaust was not a defense to liability under Section 1983.\n\nIn this case, however, the Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed Petitioners' claims because Petitioners failed to exhaust, contradicting Patsy's holding.\n\nFelder confirms that Patsy applies in state court.\n\nThis Court reasoned that the dominant characteristic of a civil rights claim is that it's judicially enforceable in the first instance, and that characteristic does not vary depending on whether the suit is filed in federal or state court.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to this case. Respondent characterizes Alabama's statute as a neutral procedural rule.\n\nBut there's nothing neutral about it.\n\nA claimant has to seek relief from the Secretary before suing the Secretary.\n\nThe claimant never -- the Secretary never has to seek relief from the claimant for anything and never has any reason to exhaust any remedy.\n\nRespondent also emphasizes that Alabama's law is jurisdictional.\n\nBut this Court has held that a state cannot avoid preemption by defining the jurisdiction of state courts to exclude cases in which the defendant asserts an affirmative defense that this Court has held is not available.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened in this case.\n\nFinally and at a minimum, the Alabama statute is preempted as applied to this case in which the Alabama Supreme Court reached the Kafkaesque conclusion that Petitioners could not challenge their inability to exhaust precisely because of their inability to exhaust.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge:\nMr. Lawyer of Defendant, would you have the same objection if Alabama required these claims to be made in a lower state court?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo, Your Honor.\n\nI think the state is allowed to direct these claims to a -- to a court as long as there's no exhaustion requirement.\n\nJudge:\nWell, what's the difference? If it's -- if -- if -- let's say -- and I'm just speculating -- that it required that it goes to something the equivalent of a municipal court before it -- before it goes to its trial court, how is that different from going to an agency? Isn't it a similar exhaustion problem?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI don't think so. When I think of an exhaustion requirement, I think of a requirement to seek relief from the very person you're planning to sue before suing that person.\n\nSo that's how Alabama's system works.\n\nYou have to seek relief from the Secretary.\n\nYou file a claim with an examiner, who is -- reports to the Secretary.\n\nYou appeal to an appeals tribunal, which also reports to the Secretary.\n\nSo you're seeking relief from the very entity that you're ultimately going to sue. And that's the defect the Court identified in the Felder case.\n\nI view that as different as the state setting up its judicial system to direct courts -- parties to a third-party neutral.\n\nJudge:\nWhat if, instead of the requirement you're complaining -- the exhaustion requirement, what if the requirement were simply that parties had to go through a mediation process? I think several jurisdictions have that.\n\nI mean, it may -- it may not last long, but before you can proceed with your suit, you have to sit down, and there's a mediator that sees -- tries to see if you can work it out.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo I think that sounds a little bit like the rule in Felder.\n\nSo I -- I probably would say that it's preempted, but I think that would boil down to as to whether it's really an exhaustion requirement.\n\nThe rule I extract from -- from Patsy is that exhaustion requirements are -- are preempted.\n\nYou know, I think there are some borderline cases about whether something really qualifies as an exhaustion requirement.\n\nI think that that question is not presented here because it pretty clearly is a requirement of that nature.\n\nJudge:\nWell, I would have thought that your -- your complaint is focusing on the sort of delay, which is what the exhaustion requirement simply imposes, and if it's simply you've got -- you've got to try mediation for a while, I don't know why you would say that's also objectionable.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I think it would depend on exactly what the nuts and bolts of the requirements are.\n\nI mean, if you have to present some version of a notice of claim to the state agency and then go through a mediation process, I might say that looks like the notice of claim requirement in Wisconsin.\n\nIf you can sue right away and then the court just sends the parties off to mediation while the claim is pending, that doesn't sound like an exhaustion requirement at all.\n\nIt is judicially enforceable in the first instance, and then the court is just applying a particular procedure to try to encourage a settlement.\n\nSo I think it would -- it would depend on how the mediation rule worked.\n\nJudge:\nMr. Lawyer of Defendant, when did the state statute of limitations start running, or has it?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo I think that's an -- an unresolved question whether it would be tolled or not.\n\nI think there is some risk that it wouldn't be tolled, that the state might say that, you know, it expired before you got the chance to exhaust because that would be the rule in federal court.\n\nBut I don't think that the -- the lower courts decided whether there would be tolling during the exhaustion process.\n\nJudge:\nHas it expired for federal purposes? You know, if your -- if your plaintiffs -- if your plaintiffs -- if your clients were to file in federal court --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nNo, I don't think --\n\nJudge:\n-- would they do so?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWe're seeking forward-looking relief, injunctive relief, so we're saying there's a continuing harm.\n\nSo, no, I think we could still file our -- our lawsuit in federal court.\n\nJudge:\nAnd just out of curiosity, why didn't you file a lawsuit in federal court? Why did you go to state?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI think we felt the state court was -- was best positioned to enter an injunction against the -- the state agency. State courts hear the overwhelming majority of unemployment insurance claims.\n\nWe just felt the state court would be in the best position to enter and administer an injunction.\n\nSo that's why we went to state court.\n\nJudge:\nI'm -- I'm very confused by this system.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure what the exhaustion is.\n\nIs it just merely of the claim for benefits, or do you also have to -- the way I read the lower court's decision, supreme court decision, which is you have to exhaust your due process claim before the agency as well.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight.\n\nSo that --\n\nJudge:\nThey said both things, not just that you have to exhaust trying to get your remedies, but you have to go to the very agency you're accusing of a due process violation to cure it, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nCorrect.\n\nThat was the holding as a matter of state law.\n\nWe argued below that you had to exhaust your claim for benefits but not the claim that the agency was too slow.\n\nBut we lost as a matter of state law on that issue.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "692", "dialogue": "Judge: And -- and you say that that's a kind of underinclusion problem. And, you know, it strikes me that on formal equal protection analysis, it is, unless the State can come forward with some piece of medical evidence that says that the risks are greater in the one area than in the other area, which you say Tennessee has not done.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm asking is, like, isn't the -- the structure of these laws going to mean that all of them are going to have to be struck down once you get to heightened scrutiny? Because you seem to want to say: No, you can do heightened scrutiny, but you can also make certain deferential moves towards the legislature.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess I'm pressing you on whether that's really true.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So I think it is true.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, we think that a categorical ban like this one is severely underinclusive and also severely overinclusive, which is an important ingredient here, and so should be invalidated.\r\n\r\nAnd if other states likewise have this kind of sweeping ban, then they would fail under heightened scrutiny.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think that means that heightened scrutiny ties the hands of the states in this regard.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with the State's approach here is that although it has targeted this gender-affirming care for disparate treatment on the basis of sex, as we say, it has left these exact same medications entirely unregulated for all other purposes and also turned its back on how it handles the risk/benefit calculus with respect to all other pediatric treatments.\r\n\r\nBut we do think there is a real space for states to regulate here, and I point to the example of West Virginia.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia was thinking about a total ban, like this one, on care for minors, but then the Senate majority leader in West Virginia, who's a doctor, looked at the underlying studies that demonstrate sharply reduced associations with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and the West Virginia legislature changed course and imposed a set of guardrails that are far more precisely tailored to concerns surrounding the delivery of this care.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia requires that two different doctors diagnose the gender dysphoria and find that it's severe and that the treatment is medically necessary to guard against the risk of self-harm. The West Virginia law also requires mental health screening to try to rule out confounding diagnoses.\r\n\r\nIt requires the parents to agree and the primary care physician to agree.\r\n\r\nAnd I think a law like that is going to fare much better under heightened scrutiny precisely because it would be tailored to the precise interests and not serve a more sweeping interest like the one asserted here in having minors appreciate their sex.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, General.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?\r\n\r\nJudge: First, I want to ask about our role here and pick up on the Chief Justice's questions at the beginning, who decides.\r\n\r\nYou've put forth forceful policy arguments to allow these medical treatments, and Justice Sotomayor's questions elaborated on -- on that.\r\n\r\nBut the 20-plus states on the other side put forth very forceful arguments against allowing these medical treatments for minors. So it seems to me that we look to the Constitution, and the Constitution doesn't take sides on how to resolve that medical and policy debate.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution's neutral on the question.\r\n\r\nAt least that's one way to look at it.\r\n\r\nI want to get your reaction to that.\r\n\r\nYou know, if the Constitution doesn't take sides, if there's strong, forceful scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn't it best to leave it to the democratic process?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, I do think that the Constitution takes a position that individuals are entitled to equal protection of the law.\r\n\r\nAnd I totally understand the force of your intuition that states need space to regulate and to try to take into account concerns like adolescent health.\r\n\r\nWe're not denying that that's an important interest here.\r\n\r\nBut, when you look at how this law actually operates, what it is doing is denying individual plaintiffs the ability to access medications on the basis of their sex.\r\n\r\nAnd that doesn't mean that the states are disabled from taking into account the actual biological differences between males and females, but that has to be channeled to the heightened scrutiny stage.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that there would be a real danger in this Court saying --looking ahead, essentially, and saying: We think there might be benign justifications here, or we think that states should have some flexibility in this regard to overlook the facial sex classification in the statute.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned, Justice Kavanaugh, about moving too fast in this space and maybe restricting the ability of states to take a close look at these issues, I think the Court could write a very narrow opinion in this --in this case, and -- and the Court could say simply that when you prohibit conduct that's inconsistent with sex, that is a sex-based line, so you do have to apply heightened scrutiny.\r\n\r\nBut the Court has made clear that that's an intermediate standard, and if the State can come forward with an important interest and substantiate that it needed to draw those sex-based lines to substantially serve the interest, that's going to be okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: Just on --keep going, sorry.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, and the final point is then you can send it back and let the Sixth Circuit grapple with this in the first instance.\r\n\r\nJudge: On the sex discrimination point, I guess picking up on Justice Kagan's questions, the -- the way you would think about this is, I guess, it prohibits all boys and girls from transitioning using certain medical treatments, and it doesn't say only boys can do so or only girls can do so.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, I think the -- the problem with trying to put that \"transitioning\" label on it as a basis to avoid the sex classification is that transition itself is inherently tied to sex.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the prohibited purpose here are those treatments that would allow a minor to live and identify inconsistent with sex, and the statute would permit anyone to have those treatments for the non-prohibited purpose, which, again, is when it's consistent with sex.\r\n\r\nThe Court has said many times that labels don't control in this space.\r\n\r\nAnd I think, when you have that kind of purpose that's expressly defined using sex-based line-drawing, you have to recognize that for what it is.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Are you saying that's in or out and why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So mental state in general is okay. So an expert can say: I believe this defendant has battered women syndrome. I believe this defendant, to use an example, has schizophrenia.\n\nJudge: I thought that's exactly what the rule says you're not supposed to have an expert do.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, no, no. What the rule says is the mental state required as an element of the crime.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there are general—\n\nJudge: And in a certain case, the element we were talking about was the defense, that the defendant was saying they were insane.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And so I thought the rule was that you were not supposed to have dueling experts talk about whether or not the defendant was insane.\n\nJudge: So I'm positing a situation in which the question is: Is this person guilty of assault?

That’s what you could not have testimony about.\n\nJudge: But it says element of the crime or defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, but the defense is still negating the mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the critical thing is to pinpoint the mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In the assault case, the mens rea would be something like a reasonable belief that the defendant was acting in self-defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: An expert can take the stand and say, \"I believe this person has battered women syndrome.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Here are characteristics of battered women syndrome: There's a cycle of abuse, there's learned helplessness, there's difficulty leaving—all things that are not the element of whether or not the defendant believed their life was in danger when they acted.\n\nJudge: So you—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —she believed her life was in danger when she acted.\n\nJudge: You disagree with the suggestion that all that's off the table because it's mental state evidence.

{"id": "743", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Gore, is there -- is there anything suspicious about the fact that a map-drawer knows the racial demographics of the state or has available the racial demographics of the state? Haven't we spoken about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. Many times, this Court has said that mere awareness or consideration of race doesn't prove racial predominance. And that would be particularly true in a state like South Carolina -- which has Voting Rights Act issues.\n\nJudge: Your defense --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- which has Voting Rights Act issues.\n\nJudge: -- was not something along the lines of we looked at the racial data, but it still -- we -- it -- it -- it didn't rise to the level of predominance. Actually, your defense was we didn't look to the racial data for this purpose. And what the court --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: -- said was, I don't believe that, made a credibility judgment, you know, basically said your -- your map-maker gets up on the stand and knows this racial data like the back of his hand, and the court says, I just don't believe that they were not looking at the racial data that was right there in front of them for the purpose of making their gerrymander more secure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And that underscores the district court's error in failing to look at all the evidence. It's true the map-drawer knew the racial composition of one precinct, one VTD. He didn't know the racial composition of other VTDs the district court asked him about, but he did know the political composition of those VTDs and testified to that at trial. Moreover, racial data is not a good predictor of partisan outcomes because racial data doesn't measure turnout or voting behavior correlations.\n\nJudge: You know --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- correlations.\n\nJudge: -- to the contrary. A presidential election is what doesn't measure turnout in a non-presidential year correctly. I mean, I'll just ask you this. There are two maps, let's -- let's say you have before you, that -- that - where the election data says these districts favored President Trump. One has a 20 percent BVAP, and the other has a 17 percent BVAP. Now doesn't any map-maker look and say, you know, I would rather have the 17 percent BVAP in order to make sure that going forward this continues to be a Republican district?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't believe that's true at all, Justice Kagan. I think they'd look at how much the areas favored President Trump by. And in this particular hypothetical, if we use Beaufort -- Berkeley County --\n\nJudge: Holding that, you know, constant --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It would depend --\n\nJudge: -- would you rather have the 20 percent BVAP or the 17 percent BVAP?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It would depend on other factors, such as compliance with traditional districting principles and other objectives the map-drawer was trying to accomplish.\n\nJudge: See, what this trial court found on the facts, on the evidence, was that the map-makers made a judgment that they would rather have the 17 percent BVAP because that -- you know, along with the election data, they might -- they were -- they -- they looked at this one year of the election data, but that the 17 percent BVAP was what was, hey, if we go above that, we're not sure we can hold this when another election comes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The record did not support that finding -- and it was infected by legal error.\n\nJudge: Well, let me ask you, what's the --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- and it was infected by legal error.\n\nJudge: -- explanation for the consistency? I mean, my understanding is that thousands of people were moved in and out of this district, and yet that line, the line concerning the amount of, you know, Black voter -- adult voter participation remained the same. So, if that was not -- if -- if what the court found here was not happening, how do you explain the consistency of that line?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We have a few explanations for that, Justice Jackson. So the first, to address Justice Kagan's hypothetical, is that the BVAP in draft plans -- through the drafting process actually changed. In the Milk Plan, it was 15.48 percent. In the Staff Plan, it was 16 percent. The enacted plan is 16.72 percent. The Staff Plan actually has a higher Republican vote share than the Milk Plan. So it did change.\n\nJudge: Was it ever higher than --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- over time.\n\nJudge: -- was it ever higher than the 17? People were being moved around, and you would assume --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They were.\n\nJudge: -- that if it was -- if it was varying, it would do so in both directions.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: People were being moved around but not very many people. Remember that District 1 retained 93 percent, almost 93 percent, of the district core, which explains why the demographic --\n\nJudge: But 80 percent of the Black people were moved out. Am I wrong about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That -- that's not true district-wide.\n\nJudge: That's not right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's not right district-wide.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, you said 93 percent? I thought it was 82.8 percent.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's -- it depends on the method you use to measure, but the method that was actually used by the General Assembly was over 92 percent district-wide.\n\nJudge: Well, that's not what the district court found. I thought it was 82.8, which was the lowest core retention of any other district.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But it was the highest --\n\nJudge: And so how do you account for the fact that 68.9 percent of whites go to CD1, but only 50.65 percent of Blacks do that are Democrats? So you're controlling for partisanship, and the numbers are that disparate.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because, again, you have to consider where in the district those voters happen to live and where the lines are drawn.\n\nJudge: So it's okay --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It was --\n\nJudge: -- for the legislature to say, I was looking at partisanship, but I'm not looking at whether someone was white or Black, but I'm going to separate CD1 so that it's a hundred miles apart in one county and the only commonality is that they live along I-26 a hundred miles apart? And I'm going to join those two Black sections or get rid of them and keep whites there, even though they've got -- they're -- they're -- even though the Democrats could have been moved?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So this Court has been clear that mere racial effects do not prove racial predominance. Moreover, the district court's analysis --\n\nJudge: No, but the numbers are -- the numbers are incredible.\n\nJudge: We're trying -- we're looking at intent here. So don't those effects say something about the intent and whether or not the court -- it was plausible -- I thought, you know, clear error standard was plausible -- it was plausible for the district court to believe or disbelieve the \"we're not looking at race\" statement made by the person who was putting this together?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But the racial effects in this plan are far less stark than the racial effects in the Cromartie and Cromartie II plan, where this Court reversed a finding of racial gerrymandering. So, for example, in Cromartie II, the line split a county and created a 72 percent BVAP area in one county and a 10 percent BVAP area in the other district.\n\nJudge: Counsel --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- and, here --\n\nJudge: -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but we've been kind of dancing around the -- the big question, which I think is, to my mind, the district court's finding that -- that your -- your clients had to have looked at race data rather than politics data because the politics data wasn't robust enough. Now you've given part of an answer. I'd just like the full answer as to why you think that is clearly erroneous. Tick it off for me.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure. So, as I said, the panel itself relied on that data. The direct evidence is that everyone relied on that data. Racial data does not predict election outcomes particularly effectively. The correlation between race and politics only affects election outcomes to the extent people turn out and vote. But racial data doesn't measure that; only election data measures that. Their own expert, Dr. Duchin, agreed with that. Dr. Duchin said that racial data could not be used to predict election outcomes because you have to know about turnout, you have to know about crossover voting and other factors.\n\nJudge: Well, there's some expert that said -- and I'm sorry to interrupt -- but there's some expert that said the absentee -- a consultant said, I believe it was, that the absentee ballots in the presidential data weren't properly allocated. What's the response to that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That that's completely incorrect. They're citing testimony from Mr. Oldham, who was involved in drawing the Senate plan, not the congressional plan. He said that, hypothetically, election data would be flawed if it didn't do that, but he didn't know one way or the other whether the General Assembly's election data did do that. And, in fact, the testimony, unrebutted at trial, on the data itself shows that the absent -- that the election data the General Assembly used did properly allocate both the absentee ballots back to the precincts and other votes down to the census block level. So it was reliable data. It was used by the map-drawer in full reliance and without manipulation, and the district court's conclusion that that was manipulated is contrary to the facts in the record.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "53", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay. So Mr. Gannon suggested you -- you can go ahead and file a new application.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: And the problem with that is that at page 16 of the Joint Appendix, the government informed my clients that its determination, its false determination of Mr. Asencio-Cordero's inadmissibility was permanent.\nSo I do not think that without an order from a court saying that the basis for that denial was insufficient --\n\nJudge: So you want a declaratory judgment that it was insufficient?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think that there's a way around that, Your Honor, because, otherwise, we're going to be fighting an impossible battle of trying to disprove that Mr. Asencio-Cordero -- or rather trying to say that he is no longer a gang member when that would require accepting this false premise in the first place.\n\nJudge: So -- so just a second. I -- I would like to know where in the record that the government told you that it's permanent and you can't reapply, and I'd like to hear from Mr. Gannon about that too.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. That is at page 16 of the Joint Appendix, Your Honor. That was far before we learned any of the additional factual material. Again, keep in mind that that came only three years after the denial and two years into litigation.\nAnd so my clients reasonably understood that the determination of inadmissibility became permanent, I believe it was in May of 2016.\nWe still had seven months in the one-year deadline, which the government says is -- in the regulations is an individual has the opportunity to overcome the denial, but that's meaningless.\nAnd it puts people in a Kafkaesque situation if the regulations say, well, sure, you have the opportunity to overcome the denial, but we're not going to tell you why.\n\nJudge: But what do -- what do you do with Mandel and Trump v. Hawaii and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Kerry v. Din, which suggested that you're not entitled to more information, this is what you're entitled to, and it's up to Congress if they want to provide more elaborate procedures or require more elaborate procedures in situations like this?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right. Well, there are many differences from Din, and -- and in the colloquy with my friend previously, there was discussion on some of the language differences --\n\nJudge: Well, all three -- sorry to interrupt.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, that's fine.\n\nJudge: All three cases suggest that a facially legitimate bona fide reason is enough and you stop there and you don't go on.\nAnd that was elaborated on in Trump v. Hawaii, that that's -- that's it. Courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion nor test it by balancing its justification against the asserted constitutional interest.\nThat's kind of it --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: -- for purposes of judicial review.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right. And so I can -- I can get to some of the distinctions with Din and Justice Kennedy's concurrence, but I want to say first that the Court has applied that facially legitimate and bona fide test in two types of situations unlike the situation here.\nThe first is the Trump v. Hawaii type situation or the Mandel type where Congress has expressly granted to the executive branch a discretionary ability to deny or grant some benefit or -- or in the case of Fiallo and Bell type situation, where that was a substantive direct challenge to a broad congressional policy choice.\nHere, the government claims as though it's operating at the peaks of plenary power, but the amicus brief from the congressmen which was submitted says at page 23 that the department's position is that this decision should have been left to one political branch, the executive.\nThe point I'm driving at, Your Honor, is that Congress here has required that consular officers have a reason to believe an individual is inadmissible.\nThe regulations refer to that as a standard which is akin to probable cause.\nSo we think, under a Mathews v. Eldridge analysis, the risk of arbitrary deprivations and along with the --\n\nJudge: Well, it seems to me --\n\nJudge: So --\n\nJudge: -- that's what you're trying to do is replace Mandel and the Justice Kennedy concurrence and Trump v. Hawaii with a Mathews v. Eldridge test, which would then in turn, as you would apply it, require substantially more process than our precedents have previously required.\nI'm not sure why we'd do that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, don't get me wrong. We think we can prevail under the facially legitimate and bona fide test as well, and if I can turn to that and the second part of Your Honor's question.\n\nDin, there were a number of important distinctions from here before I get to the statutory ones which the Court touched on already. Number one, there was a factual basis in that case on the record, the -- the fact that Ms. Din's husband was working for the Afghan government when the Taliban began was in power.\nThere was reference earlier to 1182(b)(3), which the government treats as a broad nondisclosure provision.\nThat is not the position that they took in Din v. Kerry, where they said, at page 50 and 51 of their merits brief, that when the court does -- when the executive does disclose -- disclose additional material, that reflects a considered determination that the information provided does not require invoking the protections of 1182(b)(3).\nThey did not invoke 1182(b)(3) now, at the time of the denial.\nAnd so we think that that militates for at least enough --\n\nJudge: But that's -- that's an implicit weighing of the competing interests, right? I mean, you have to have that at some point, given your claim.\nAnd I just want to know how you do that.\nHow do you weigh the interest in cohabitation and marriage against the security values under consular non-reviewability?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure. And I think the answer is more simple than the government lets on.\nBecause the regulations, which the Department of Homeland Security applies in the domestic context to the same exact statutory framework, the same grounds of inadmissibility, 8 C.F.R. 103.2 says that an applicant shall be advised of the facts --\n\nJudge: Well, I don't mean to --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- leading to denial.\n\nJudge: Well, I guess I do mean to interrupt.\nI mean, it's -- it's -- you say in the domestic context.\nThat's kind of a pretty dramatic premise, if you're going to say, well, it's the same as it's going to be in the domestic context.\nThe whole point of consular non-reviewability is that it's not in the domestic context.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, but by the same token, Your Honor, it wouldn't make sense if these due process regulations apply in the domestic context to non-citizens but they don't apply when a U.S. citizen's rights are implicated at the consular level.\nThe amicus brief submitted by former DHS officials suggests that this is a reasonable, workable proposal.\nAnd they cite this provision, which I'd just like to quote briefly, which says that the applicant \"shall be advised of the facts and offered an opportunity to rebut the information and present information in his or her own behalf before the decision is rendered.\"\n\nJudge: Counsel --\n\nJudge: That may be --\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, Chief.\n\nJudge: I was just going to say that seems to be flatly contrary to what -- you know, the quote from Justice Frankfurter, which I don't remember.\nHe said that's something that's been in the body politic from the very beginning, that the United States has control over its borders with respect to non-citizens who seek to come in.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "228", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay. So your answer is that the non-citizen cannot be found removable unless the government shows by clear and convincing evidence that the notice was provided and that he is removable, and you're saying that there's no way to show that he's removable if the NTA has not been served? So at least that much information would have to be there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If there's no document that contains charges against the non-citizen, there's no way to show that they're removable.\n\nJudge: Okay. So it doesn't eliminate the hypothetical of the right to counsel not being included, but it would eliminate the hypothetical of the entirely blank document?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's fair.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Can we go back to the distinction, if any, between the stop-time rule and in absentia removal? I understood you to respond by saying that the government's position is that the stop-time rule gives the government a procedural advantage, the ability to thwart the accrual of time, and so that's why the government has to dot all the I's and cross all the T's with respect to that. But I see this as exactly the same thing, because, ordinarily, a non-citizen would be entitled to a hearing where they could make an argument and advocate for themselves about removal, and the statute allows the government to get around that by obtaining a removal order in the absence of adversarial presentation. So why would we have a statute that requires the government to give notice in order to be able to get an in absentia removal order, but would allow that notice to be deficient?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I have a couple of responses to that. First, we agree that non-citizens get the opportunity to present their case, and they get that opportunity by showing up at the hearing. In these cases, we told the non-citizens when and where to show up to present their case, and they failed to do that.\n\nJudge: But the statute doesn't say, if the non-citizen doesn't show up, the government gets the removal order. The statute says, if the non-citizen doesn't show up and the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that they got notice and that the person is removable, then the government gets the order. So the government can't rely on the fact that the person didn't show up as the basis for the validity of their removal order. My question remains: If the government doesn't actually prove that they gave the notice required by the statute, why should the government be entitled to getting the removal order when it wouldn't have been able to get the stop-time order under prior precedents?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: My answer is similar to the one I gave before. For in absentia removal, two notices are relevant and can be a basis for in absentia removal.\n\nJudge: No, you're just saying that the notice isn't deficient. Let's assume that the notice is deficient. If the notice is deficient, why should the government still get the removal order, when in the stop-time rule scenario, the government wouldn't be able to stop the time? Are you asking us to implicitly overrule prior decisions?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, we are asking you to take prior decisions seriously when they stated that they were narrow decisions about the intersection between the stop-time rule and the notice to appear requirements. We are not saying that if a non-citizen gets no notice whatsoever, they can be ordered removed in absentia. In these cases, while the notice to appear lacked certain information, that missing information was supplied by the notices of hearing that the non-citizens received.\n\nJudge: But you don't dispute that the missing information in this case is the same missing information in the prior cases, correct? We're not talking about two different kinds of missing information that might allow you to make this distinction?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't dispute that the information is the same. I dispute that the relevance is the same because, in prior cases, there was concern that if we never told the non-citizen when and where to show up, they wouldn’t be able to figure out what to do. Here, the information was provided.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you two quick things. One, is in absentia removal the only way the government can remove a non-citizen?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct. If a non-citizen goes to their removal proceeding, they can be found removable. So I didn't mean to suggest that in absentia is the only way.\n\nJudge: Or if you find them and arrest them and bring them for removal, they can be removed, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s the way an ordinary removal proceeding works, and that’s the way these removal proceedings were initiated as well. What’s different about these cases is the non-citizens just didn’t finish out the process.\n\nJudge: And finally, regarding the catastrophic nature of a ruling in favor of the other side, you said that the Ninth Circuit finds automatic reopening. Couldn’t we agree with the Ninth Circuit's holding on the deficiency of the notice but disagree that there's automatic reopening for all the people who have previously had this problem?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The question of what is the remedy and whether it’s automatic or not is not before you. I don’t think it’s fairly included as part of the question presented.\n\nJudge: But if we were to hold that the notice was deficient, it's not necessarily the case that we would have this catastrophic result because we could separately decide the remedy question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s true; you could have a later remedy case. But even if it's not automatic, a significant number of these motions are likely to be granted because the non-citizens claim they did not get notice. If they are granted and reintroduced into the immigration system, that will have significant impacts.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But we believe the text of 2401 and the APA supports our argument.\n\nJudge: There’s no res judicata or collateral estoppel, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The government has argued in the district court below that res judicata principles may apply. If we prevail on remand, they could raise those arguments.\n\nJudge: Is that your answer to the list of concerns the government raised in their brief? There’s a whole list of potential issues. You’ve said they won’t happen, but why aren’t they real possibilities?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There are multiple safeguards. The government can raise defenses against what some call \"manufactured plaintiffs\" who create an injury to challenge regulations. Also, according to the government’s own position, cases like this are rare. Many regulations are already time-barred under repose-based statutes, and the majority of potential plaintiffs cannot challenge old regulations.\n\nJudge: But it doesn’t seem hard to find a new regulated entity. If a trade association doesn’t like a ruling from 10 years ago, they can create a new company and try again.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Simply creating a new entity wouldn’t be enough. If that were a real issue, we would have seen it happen in the Sixth Circuit, but we haven’t observed an uptick in challenges to old regulations there.\n\nJudge: If there was circuit precedent barring a plaintiff under stare decisis, would they lose on the merits even if their claim was timely?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: And the government may use non-mutual collateral estoppel or res judicata to block the case anyway?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: So this is just about the timing of the suit. Also, you mentioned that as-applied challenges could still go forward, but if you lose and we say \"accrual\" happens at the time of rule adoption, wouldn’t that undermine those decisions too?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that’s possible.\n\nJudge: Then what about the last sentence of 702, which states that nothing herein affects other limitations on judicial review?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This Court addressed that in Darby v. Cisneros. In 1976, Congress waived sovereign immunity under 702, and it clarified that this waiver did not affect existing limitations on judicial review.

{"id": "847", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff:\nI think that's also right.\n\nI mean, Congress didn't speak to this issue, and you could hold, consistent with your opinion in Jones versus Bock, that Congress's silence means that the ordinary procedures should apply.\n\nAnd in this case, the ordinary situation is that disputed facts about affirmative defenses that are intertwined with the merits go to a jury.\n\nJudge:\nIf we get to the functional considerations that Justice Barrett was raising, it does seem to me like you would look at the policy of the PLRA.\n\nThe Court has said to look to statutory policies.\n\nAnd that policy seems quite inconsistent with a jury trial right on the exhaustion question because the whole idea of exhaustion was to be speedy, to have the prison be able to resolve things quickly. And it seems just -- you know -- you know the argument on the other side, it just seems generally inconsistent with the policy in the PLRA.\n\nSo you want to respond to that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSure, Justice Kavanaugh. Two points.\n\nI mean, I -- the State relies, I think, principally upon a 1966 case called Katchen versus Landy that has some language that sort of suggests that congressional policy can be relevant to functional considerations.\n\nI think the Court has moved significantly away from that, and after cases like Granfinanciera, I'm not sure about the continuing viability of Katchen versus Landy.\n\nBut the other thing is that --\n\nJudge:\nWhat about Markman? Markman --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI mean, Del Monte Dunes was an application of Markman itself.\n\nAnd I think that, you know, this case, if -- if you have a spectrum from sort of pure historical facts to legal issues, Markman is sort of on one end and our case and Del Monte Dunes are on the other.\n\nWe're not talking about construing a legal term of art, you know, in a -- in a legal instrument.\n\nJudge:\nWell, my --\n\nJudge:\nOne would have thought that if Congress was thinking about this as requiring the judge to make a determination to supplant the jury trial question, the PLRA does have a list of things that a court has to do without objection.\n\nIt has to look at the complaint and decide whether any immunities apply, whether --a bunch of other things that it requires.\n\nGrievance is not one of them.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThat's right, Justice Sotomayor.\n\nAnd that was part of the Court's holding in -- in Jones --\n\nJudge:\nJonas.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- when it determined this is an affirmative defense.\n\nI mean, to be clear, there are other things that Congress could do but hasn't done to narrow the scope of cases that can get past Rule 56 and require a trial.\n\nBut, once an issue is made, to use the language from Tellabs, once a genuine issue of fact is made under whatever the requirements are in the statute, it goes to the jury, and I don't think Congress has anything to say on that.\n\nJudge:\nSo, on this antecedent question of whether you're entitled to the jury trial right in the first place, because of the analog, because of the historical considerations, what have you, no circuit has held that, right? So we would be kind of treading into new territory that's different -- I mean, it goes beyond the QP.\n\nIt was briefed that way.\n\nAnd --and let's just assume, if you lose on the intertwined question, you could still win if we decided that the, you know, defense was entitled to a jury trial regardless, that it didn't depend on factual intertwinement.\n\nBut isn't it the case that that would be going into -- that would be striking significantly new ground?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nIn some sense, it would, and in some sense, it wouldn't.\n\nI think the problem with the -- the current state of the law, frankly, is that the fist decisions on this after the PLRA was enacted came about in the early 2000s.\n\nI think it was a Ninth Circuit case called Wyatt.\n\nAnd it was before this Court decided Jones.\n\nAnd the Court just sort of referred to exhaustion as a matter of abatement or a rule of judicial administration without really thinking through what that means.\n\nAnd the courts have -- have not reconsidered those decisions in a meaningful way after Jones.\n\nJudge:\nSo, true, I'm not -- I'm not saying that they've gotten it right. That's kind of an argument for, hey, they've done this reflexively or they all followed the first court to --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\n-- answer the question.\n\nBut we don't have cases where circuit courts or courts of appeals have reflected on this issue and said here are, you know, the historical analogs and the reasons why it comes within the Seventh Amendment or here are the functional reasons why it does or it doesn't. We would be doing that for the first time, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYou would.\n\nAnd I don't think it's that different than what you did in Jones, although there were a couple circuits on -- on the Court's side.\n\nBut I think that there's a pretty well-worn path between what you've held in Jones and what we know from Del Monte Dunes and other cases.\n\nJudge:\nAnd why -- why would we do that, though? I mean, just to follow up on that question, that seems like a big question.\n\nA lot of the questions from my colleagues have pointed out the historical uncertainty.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nI guess I'm not certain why, as a matter of prudence, we would leap into something like that without lower court opinions, et cetera.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYeah.\n\nI mean, it would be contrary to the Court's normal sort of preference to decide only what must be decided. I think the only reason you would do it is if you thought the law is so clear that it's actually the simpler path to resolution and it would clarify the confusion that would, you know, otherwise still exist in the courts of appeals and the district courts.\n\nSo that would be the reason to do it.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "510", "dialogue": "Judge: So this is more like the sort of initial hypothetical of criminalizing eating outside, not that you'd be doing something that was otherwise criminally culpable?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah. Yes. I mean, I suppose there could be ordinances that the city would have about where you can -- you know, you can't eat at -- can't consume --\n\nJudge: That is time, place, and manner.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Final question. You mentioned with respect to states doing this. Why isn't the federal government arguing this case is moot in light of 195.530? This is the Oregon recently passed statute that I mentioned earlier. Why doesn't the government read that law as I do to prevent Grants Pass from enforcing its ordinances to block sleeping outdoors at all places and all times?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, no, I certainly agree there appears to be a pretty stark inconsistency between that state law and the ordinance. It hasn't been applied. It has to be objectively reasonable, I think --\n\nJudge: So would the federal government --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- but this isn't time, place, and manner at all.\n\nJudge: Right. So what would your position be if the Court decided that as a matter of constitutional avoidance or whatever else that we don't need to hear this or reach this decision in this case, given this new state ordinance?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That -- that would be one possibility. It wouldn't answer the core Robinson principle point and the limitations on that point that has triggered the amicus briefs.\n\nJudge: Right. But our typical rule is that if there's some other way, we don't necessarily comment on constitutional issues, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right. And yes. And that would be one course to see how what time, place, and manner meant under state law and how the Eighth Amendment could accommodate that or take it into account.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Robinson v. California holds that status-based punishment schemes are categorically cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. The challenged ordinances inflict status-based punishment in both effect and purpose.\n\nAlthough the City describes its ordinances as punishing camping on public property, it defines a campsite as any place a homeless person is while covered with a blanket. The City interprets and applies the ordinances to permit non-homeless people to rest on blankets in public parks while a homeless person who does the same thing breaks the law.\n\nThe ordinances, by design, make it physically impossible for homeless people to live in Grants Pass without facing endless fines and jail time.\n\nThe only question under Robinson is whether there's any meaningful difference between a law that says being homeless is punishable and a law that says being homeless while breathing or sleeping or blinking is punishable.\n\nIn other words, does adding a universal human attribute to the definition of the offense make the punishment conduct-based instead of status-based? The answer is no.\n\nThe purpose and effect of the second statute is exactly the same as the first, to make people with a status endlessly and unavoidably punishable if they don't leave Grants Pass.\n\nIndeed, all the ordinances do is turn the City's homelessness problem into someone else's problem by forcing its homeless residents into other jurisdictions.\n\nThe injunction below leaves the City with an abundance of tools to address homelessness.\n\nIt can impose time, place, and manner restrictions on when and where homeless people sleep. It can ban tents and clear encampments. It can enforce a sleeping ban against homeless people who decline shelter. And it can fully enforce laws prohibiting littering, public urination, defecation, drug use, and violent or harassing behavior.\n\nThe only tool the City wants that it doesn't have is the authority to impose a 24/7 City-wide sleeping ban that forces its homeless residents to either move to another jurisdiction or face endless punishment.\n\nThe state police power is broad, but it does not include the power to push the burdens of social problems like poverty onto other communities or the power to satisfy public demand by compromising individual constitutional rights.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: In Robinson, there was a statute that outlawed -- that said that \"to be addicted\" is a crime. Is there an ordinance here that says \"to be homeless\" is a crime?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: So the language \"for the purposes of a temporary place to live\" bakes homelessness into the definition of the offense. Justice Sotomayor was talking about that earlier.\n\nSo when you combine that language with the definition of camping, what you have is an ordinance that says being homeless, while sleeping with a blanket, is punishable.\n\nAnd as I just said earlier, the question becomes: when you attach the status to the universal attribute of sleeping, does it then transform the offense into conduct-based punishment instead of status-based punishment? And I think the answer is no.\n\nJudge: A number of us, I think, are having difficulty with the distinction between status and conduct.\n\nYou'll acknowledge, won't you, that in those terms, there's a difference between being addicted to drugs and being homeless?\n\nIn other words, someone who's homeless can immediately become not homeless, right, if they find shelter.\n\nSomeone who is addicted to drugs, it's not so easy.\n\nIt seems to me that in Robinson, it's much easier to understand drug addiction as an ongoing status, while here I think it is different because you can move into and out of and into and out of the status, as you would put it, of being homeless.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "946", "dialogue": "Judge: This is an old question, but, you know, eating is a basic human function as well, that people have to do, just like sleeping. So if someone is hungry and no one is giving him food, can you prosecute him if he breaks into a store to get something to eat?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Absolutely, absolutely. Breaking into a store is a common crime that not everybody engages in, unlike sleeping, which is what we have here, which is really—\n\nJudge: But it's a necessity for the person who needs food.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's not a necessity to break into a store. And with respect to—\n\nJudge: Well, you're fighting the hypothetical. I'm saying this person needs food.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And the Eighth Amendment does not require that that person be excused from doing it. I think there's a certain amount of common sense and practicality to this, and it's, I think, well understood that just like drug use is not something the Eighth Amendment excuses you from, neither is eating.\n\nAnd the problem of eating is addressed at the local level as the history and the poor law show—that the community takes care of its own residents. And it's common now, as it was at the founding, for churches and individuals to offer their help through charity in the community.\n\nAnd that's what happens in Grants Pass. Various organizations feed the homeless people. And there are social services to help the homeless people. So this is consistent except for the absolute ban on sleeping in the city. Otherwise, the community's response is what has been done down through history.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is the city's absolute ban—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —that interrupts that continuity.\n\nJudge: Justice, do you have any questions?\n\nJustice: Could you explain how your rule would be carried out by police officers on a day-to-day basis? Let's say that there are 500 beds in a particular town, and it's 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon on a winter day.\n\nWhat is an individual police officer supposed to do? Would the officer go around and count the number of people who are getting ready to sleep outside? Let’s say it’s 6:00. Would the officer count the number of people getting ready to sleep outside for the night and then ask each one of them whether they've tried to find a bed at a shelter?\n\nWould the officer ask whether that person would be willing to go to a shelter if a bed is available without any conditions? Or whether the bed would have to be available under conditions the individual wants, like not going to a shelter that won’t take their dog?\n\nCan you explain how this would work on a daily basis?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, first of all, with respect to the individual encounter, I think the way this would work in the real world—it’s important to understand what happens on the ground in these situations.\n\nI think in the circumstances you’re describing, what would happen is that the person encountering the homeless individual would know whether there is a spot available. I don’t think the homeless person would be required to check each day with each shelter if there are multiple shelters.\n\nAnd in larger cities, these initial encounters are not handled by law enforcement. They're typically handled by social services agencies that are in contact with people who are camping and know what their circumstances are. These agencies would be able to say: \"We know that at such-and-such shelter, there are beds available—would you be willing to go?\"\n\nJustice: What if there’s a question about whether there are enough shelter beds available? Your rule wouldn’t apply if there are enough beds available, right? If there are 500 shelter beds and only 200 people trying to sleep outside, then your rule wouldn’t apply?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, right.\n\nJustice: So you have to compare the number of beds available with the number of people who want to sleep outside?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, yes.\n\nJustice: So that would be the threshold question?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. And I just want to clarify one point about that. It’s not simply a matter of the number of beds against the number of homeless people, such that if there is a deficit, the city can't enforce the law at all.\n\nIf you have individualized questioning and you know that there are vacancies available—even if not for everyone—but there is a vacancy for the person being interviewed, then yes, that person, if offered a bed and refuses, could be prosecuted or cited.\n\nJustice: What if the person says, \"Yeah, I know there's a bed available at the Gospel Rescue Mission, but they won’t take my dog\"?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think the inability to take your dog to a shelter is a sufficient reason. There are shelters in some larger cities that may well take pets, but—\n\nJustice: I know I could sleep in the home of a family member, but they really hate me and treat me badly.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—\n\nJustice: I’m just wondering how this is going to be administered on a daily basis.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I think, with all respect, that example—if the family is going to accept them, then that’s the question. Whether there is a place to sleep.\n\nBut I don’t know that it would very often come down to \"that family hates me.\" On the other hand, if it's a woman who left a domestic abuse situation, she couldn't be expected to go back to that home.\n\nJustice: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there's a lot of common sense involved. And again, the first encounter that a police officer or someone else has with a homeless person is very unlikely to be a situation where the person would be immediately issued a citation.\n\nJustice: Okay. You mentioned a couple of things I wanted to follow up on. Does it matter whether the person grew up in the town or not?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJustice: So if they tell a police officer or social worker, \"I'm from Fargo, but if I have to sleep outside, I'd rather do it here than in Fargo,\" that doesn’t matter?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, and that’s not because of any Eighth Amendment rule, but under this Court’s decisions, various constitutional provisions prohibit attaching that sort of limitation to a newcomer.\n\nJustice: I used to live in New Jersey, where there are a lot of small municipalities. I could go for a 20-minute walk in the evening and be in three or four different towns.\n\nIf there aren’t enough beds in one town, but there are beds in a nearby town, does that mean the first town is out of luck?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the way you're describing it, that set of small, closely-knit communities might be considered one community. The person wouldn't be banished from where they lived just because a shelter exists in a neighboring area.\n\nJustice: Some tiny municipalities don’t even have parks. If someone is going to sleep outside, the only place would be on the street. What happens then?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Certainly not on the street because of safety and traffic concerns. But even in the smallest town, there are probably locations where a person could sleep.\n\nJustice: All right. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice, do you have any further questions?\n\nJustice: I don’t want to be repetitive, but what are we vacating and remanding for? An individualized finding of what?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the class was defined simply based on aggregate numbers, without an individualized determination—frankly, in our view, not even a sufficient determination of the two named plaintiffs.\n\nJustice: So you're talking about standing?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, and possibly other legal issues, such as whether the named plaintiffs' situations were representative of the broader case.\n\nJustice: All right.

{"id": "219", "dialogue": "Judge: Did all of those states -- I mean, you know, the Sixth Amendment didn't apply to the states back then. So when you're saying, well, you can't point to a single one in which a court struck it down, were there state analogues to the Sixth Amendment that would be relevant?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think states did have comparable jury trial rights, and also states in which the supplemental information statutes were enacted, they had grand jury requirements that required all elements to be in an indictment. And so -- and these were challenged on constitutional grounds, and courts uniformly upheld them. This goes all the way back to 1824 and the Massachusetts Ross case that we cite in our brief, all the way through to this Court's decision in Graham. There's no decision that I'm aware of to the contrary. So I do think there is a -- even if it was -- even if it were our burden to show uniform tradition here, I think the uniform tradition was one of legislative discretion when it comes to recidivism.\n\nJudge: What about Mathis and Descamps? You know, it's true they're statutory cases, but, you know, there is some avoidance language in them, which you recognize in your brief. Do you want to talk about that a little about it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure. So the language in Mathis and Descamps admittedly not great for my position here. I think --\n\nJudge: We appreciate your candor.\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I do think that the Court just didn't resolve the constitutional question in those cases. They -- they were -- as you said, they were avoidance cases. I think most of what the Court held in those cases was that there is a serious constitutional question about the scope of Almendarez-Torres. And I think that's what this case is about. But I don't think that those cases resolved that question. And I don't think any other decision of this Court has either.\n\nJudge: Can you turn to the theory for a second? You said in your opening that you find the other side's position to be unprincipled. So why is that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So for a few reasons. I think, first of all, their principle in this case, which I think was reiterated in the opening, was this elements-only principle, this principle that judges can only find facts that juries previously found beyond a reasonable doubt. And I just don't think that their theory, their test that they end up articulating, lines up with that principle because they recognize that if the Court were to double down on that elements-only principle, it would blow up the categorical approach because judges, in doing predicate felony determinations, often find facts that are not elements of prior offenses like identity, like the date of the offense, like the sequencing issue in Almendarez-Torres itself. So they articulate -- they have to fall back from their elements-only principle, and they end up articulating standards like the government's standard, for example, facts encapsulated in judicial records that are components of prior convictions. I think that's what the government says. That test is in no decision of this Court. I don't think it's in a decision of any court, as far as I can tell.\n\nAnd so I think because they are departing from their principle, they are articulating novel tests that really don't have any grounding in this Court. And then the last thing I would say is that I think their test, at least the government's test, is not descriptively accurate, even to -- because the test, facts encapsulated in judicial records, that -- identity is not encapsulated in judicial records. The date of the offense is not a component of the prior conviction. So I think the government's test, and I think the other side's test too, although I'm a little less clear on what it actually is, I think none of them had a principle that actually explains where they end up landing.\n\nJudge: I mean, as I understand that argument, it's really just to say that Almendarez-Torres and Apprendi are in a little bit of tension with each other. And who would deny that, really? I mean, even Apprendi understood that. But there's nothing about that bit of tension that has made the system fail to work. And, you know, why would we allow that bit of tension, which has existed for decades now, to suggest an answer to this question that does not seem the one that all our past precedents point to?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I -- I guess I would say I don't think there needs to be tension between Apprendi and Almendarez-Torres. I think, certainly under the government and the other side's view, there is tension. But I think under my reading of Apprendi and Almendarez-Torres, they drew a pretty clear line between facts about prior crimes, facts about present crimes. I think, again, Apprendi said that multiple times. And so I think if you interpret it that way, the tension sort of resolves itself.\n\nAnd I think the fact that the Court has -- or courts have found non-elemental facts in doing the predicate felony inquiry suggests that that's really what the line is, is I think my fundamental point.\n\nJudge: Your -- on the tension, I think your point is that the history has two different rules.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right.\n\nJudge: And -- and --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- Almendarez-Torres recognized that.\n\nJudge: -- and it's rooted in concern about prejudicing defendants.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right. And I think, in Apprendi itself, the Court demanded a uniform standard as to sentence-enhancing facts about present crimes. And so I think it would be somewhat anomalous not to require an extension of that uniformity down to the different tradition of recidivism facts.\n\nAnd I think that's exactly what Almendarez-Torres recognized, admittedly before Apprendi, but that there was no such uniform tradition in this different context. And so, in this context, facts about present crimes, those don't need -- there's no constitutional prescription there.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "398", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-1270, Riley versus Bondi.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. A sensible scheme of judicial review would provide a right to review on a petition properly filed, particularly on matters of life and death where errors left uncorrected are so contrary to the fundamental policies of the United States. But it also would not have the courts routinely intrude while the agency is still doing its work.\n\nWhen the agency is deliberating where a non-citizen can be sent in light of an objection duly raised in the ordinary processes, that work is ongoing. Amicus's proposal would mean that a non-citizen like Defendant is allowed to seek a Court's decision on withholding issues that the agency has barely begun to assess. The INA does not suggest that Congress intended that surprising result. Instead, the statute is consistent with common sense.\n\nRegarding jurisdiction, Santos-Zacaria already explained that Stone was not a holding on that point. The Court should adhere to what it said there. And, certainly, 1252(b)(1) does not rank as jurisdictional under the modern rubric.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Did Defendant seek review of the order -- removal order?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We are seeking -- we are not seeking review of his removability. We are seeking review of the CAT decision, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: But the -- the only jurisdiction we have is over the removal order.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think that's -- I -- I would -- I would question that premise, Your Honor.\n\n(A)(4) does also allow --\n\nJudge: Or a final order. Excuse me, a final order.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: The -- the court -- the statute allows the court to conduct review within 30 days of a final order from removal, but it also clearly says the Court has jurisdiction to review a CAT order as the Court explained in Nasrallah already.\n\nJudge: Have we ever said that you could do that independent of the final order?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- not independent in the sense -- and that is exactly the problem, Your Honor. I think that the sensible approach is to wait until the agency has concluded all of its work, and then you have one petition that encompasses removability, the order of removal, and the CAT questions that are at issue.\n\nJudge: Does the CAT question then convert the -- the final order into a broader final order by attaching itself to that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think what Nasrallah teaches us, like -- certainly, is that it does not convert the -- a CAT order that says -- that -- that denies CAT relief is not converting the final order into something else, except from the timing of it and what gets decided is affecting the finality, because as we explained in the brief, and I believe the government agrees, where you can be sent is something that remains to be decided.\n\nThe -- the removal order under the government's regulations has to tell you where you're going to be sent. You have an opportunity to object right -- right then. If the process results in that being -- that -- that where not working, then they are going to tell you where else. And then you might proceed into another. So -- so it does not affect the removability.\n\nJudge: So do you have -- what's your best textual hook for that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I'm sorry, for -- for which, hook for what?\n\nJudge: For your -- for your argument that the CAT order has to be -- it can expand the time limit of the final order.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So it -- it turns on what final means, Your Honor. And the -- the statute, we submit, obviously it explains what makes something final in certain circumstances. And aside from that, it's a word that this Court has interpreted in many contexts to mean that the agency's decision-making is full and complete on all issues, that the agency has disassociated itself from the decision-making process. That's the word final.\n\nJudge: So one definition in the statute, at least the courts on amicus's side argued -- or concede that the one issue that defines finality is when the Board concludes its work, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: When the Board concludes its work, that -- that -- that is correct.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And here when the Board concludes its work as you know is --\n\nJudge: Is after the CAT, because the CAT decision --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's right.\n\nJudge: -- can change the final order, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Absolutely, correct.\n\nJudge: Because it will change -- the final order says you're -- you are removable, you're going to X country. And the CAT order will say no, make it Y country. So there is an amendment.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: There -- there -- there is -- there is an amendment, that's right.\n\nJudge: So this is almost like a conviction and a sentence, meaning the conviction is final in a court -- in a district court, until you appeal it, and the -- but you wait for the sentence for the appeal because you want the court to finish with everything at once.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I think you have it exactly right, that -- that analogy. And Nasrallah was familiar with that analogy, of course.\n\nJudge: That's the one it gave.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's the one in Nasrallah, that --\n\nJudge: All right. Now, Congress does use the word administrative in a different provision, the detention provision.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: 1252. So there they said when an order is administratively filed, meaning when the agency has finished on this particular question. But it uses a different word, final order of removal, here. That difference, how does it play into your argument?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That difference, I think, is -- is good support for us in that administratively final, presumably the administratively means something. It points us to that moment is a different moment from the moment when the -- when the order is final for purposes of judicial review. Therefore, we would expect -- not necessarily in every case -- but we would expect that, conceptually, administratively different final is different from final.\n\nAnd so that point, that Guzman Chavez pointed out, when detention can begin because one issue in the case has been resolved is different from the case point when everything is finished, when the agency has fully finished with its work. That's final for judicial review.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Just on the 30-day deadline, do you understand our position to be that we're never going to find jurisdictional bar again? (Laughter.)\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Certainly not. I -- I think that there are -- there may well be one out there. I have not canvassed the U.S. Code. But the -- the Court has been -- has -- has demanded something very clear from Congress to indicate that a time bar is jurisdictional.\n\nAnd there's nothing here -- more here than the others that have not been jurisdictional.\n\nJudge: Well, I mean, there is the fact that they applied equitable tolling in the prior -- the -- the -- the Stone case and said equitable tolling was not available, which sounds like something you would say if you're dealing with a jurisdictional provision.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "318", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo let me address it with two --two points.\n\nThe first goes to what the motion below actually did, and the second goes to the sequencing Sinochem point that has been raised.\n\nFirst is, what did the motion do? It starts at page 24 of the court of appeals joint appendix.\n\nIt's a motion to reopen and to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nThe only relief it requests is to vacate the arbitral award, and it does not ever request to reopen actually the existing federal claim.\n\nAnd the reason we know that is the only other aspect of relief it requests is to appoint a new arbitrator to adjudicate that claim for relief. So the only thing the motion does is to seek to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nIt's seeking to use Rule 60(b) as the jurisdictional hook to do that, something that the case itself could not do.\n\nSo that's -- that's the first point: What does the motion do? The district court then breaks it apart into two separate orders.\n\nIt says: I'm reopening under 60(1) -- 60(b)(1) and (6).\n\nAnd then it says under the FAA, later, I'm going to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nSo you have -- the only request that's ever been made is to vacate the arbitral award. That's the relief that requires subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe relief that's being requested requires its own form of subject -- its own basis for subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe only basis presented is Rule 60.\n\nThat is not sufficient under Kokkonen.\n\nJudge:\nBut I don't --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- the only basis --\n\nJudge:\n-- understand -- I don't understand that at all.\n\nI mean, after --I appreciate that the request seemed to merge the two.\n\nBut, once the district court broke them apart and issued two separate orders and the rest of the way there was a challenge as to whether or not the district court properly granted a motion to reopen, and that was the thing that this Court took cert on, I don't understand why it necessitates us to care about whether the district court was right with respect to its other order.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI -- Justice Jackson, it's because the motion to reopen had sought no relief on a claim.\n\nJudge:\nI understand --I understand what it sought.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that that claim could never have been responded to by the district court until it had the ability to do something.\n\nAnd so, as a threshold matter, the district court said this is a closed case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nIt --\n\nJudge:\nI would have to reopen it to give you the relief that you seek.\n\nI'm issuing Order Number 1 reopening the case, and then here's Order Number 2 regarding the relief that you seek.\n\nAnd from then on, we all were focused on whether or not the district court made a mistake in determining that this case could even be reopened. And, to the extent that that's the issue, that that's what was presented here, that that' s what the courts have split on, I don't understand why we can't just isolate that as requested and answer it.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI'm not afraid of the question presented, but I -- to -- the -- the jurisdictional point is --is important here.\n\nIf the motion had requested some form of relief related to the case itself, if it had been I want to relitigate my case and vacate the arbitral award, then at least there would be a request for relief that -- over which the district court originally had subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nJudge:\nBut, Mr. McGill, on the first one, as I understand the common law history, courts had -- were considered to have jurisdiction over orders, even final ones, judgments, until the expiration of the term of the court, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nExcept with respect to voluntary non-suits, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nCorrect.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n60(b), there's -- I would think that Rule 60(b) can't expand itself the district court's --\n\nJudge:\nNo, of course not.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nJudge:\nBut -- but -- but the point was that courts have always had this -- this kind of power to fix injustices in their judgments, in their orders, at least during the term of court, got rid of that.\n\nBut the -- the point should remain with that change that they generally do.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI think a district court certainly has jurisdiction.\n\nIf you look at the Beggerly case, the district court has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an independent action attack --attacking the judgment for --\n\nJudge:\nAnd to --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- for massive fraud, for instance.\n\nJudge:\nAnd to reopen for massive fraud or things like that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nCorrect.\n\nBut that --but --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nAll right.

And then, on -- on --on \"final\" and what does \"final\" mean and what it meant in 1946 more importantly, I take --took it to mean that it's not interlocutory.\n\nI mean, that's how Black's defined it.\n\nThat's how Moore and Rogers, that's how the Rules Committee -- do you disagree with that understanding?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nIt -- there has to be a conclusive resolution of the issues in the litigation.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nI'll take that. Why isn't there at least a conclusive resolution that the Petitioner's first non-suit is gone? They don't get another free bite at the apple, right? Voluntary dismissal, the beauty of it is you get another chance anytime you want, but you only get one.\n\nAfter that, you have to have leave of court. And, here, didn't the district court at --at least resolve that by saying you've had your non -suit, you've had your voluntary dismissal.\n\nWhy didn't it finally, conclusively resolve that aspect of --of the plaintiff's rights?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThe --so the -- the dismissal is the retraction of a complaint.\n\nIt doesn't resolve any issue --\n\nJudge:\nBut it --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- in the litigation.\n\nJudge:\nBut you'd agree, though, that the withdrawal of the non -suit, as it used to be called, that --that does have a consequence in the world?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nThe --the dismissal has a legal effect.\n\nAnd --\n\nJudge:\nPlaintiff doesn't get another free bite at the apple.\n\nHe's exhausted his one free bite.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI -- I guess I would -- I would phrase it a little bit differently, Justice Gorsuch.\n\nI would say, if he chooses to file a -- a second suit and dismisses that second suit, then that disposition under Rule 41 would be with prejudice.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nSo that --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- is an external circumstance.\n\nJudge:\n-- so that would -- would that amount to a final something for your purposes?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nA dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41?\n\nJudge:\nWell, the second time. Say he withdraws again.\n\nThe second time?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nHas he --so that would be.\n\nSo, if he voluntary withdrew again and, therefore, out of luck?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nAnd may I -- may -- may I just elaborate why?\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nBecause it --it's a conclusive resolution.\n\nIt's an adjudication -- it operates under the rules as an adjudication on the merits.\n\nIt resolves everything.\n\nJudge:\nCorrect.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "7", "dialogue": "Judge: All right. Let me ask you about the standing question real quick. Does the government dispute that the plaintiff had standing at the time that he filed his suit in 2013?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: All right. So he did. And don't we ordinarily assess standing at the time the person brings the lawsuit? If you have standing to file the lawsuit, then, to the extent your circumstances change, we now move into the realm of evaluating it under mootness, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct, but I'll point out that Already, which was a case about mootness, did mention that in these circumstances where the claim is no longer really live, cases like Lyons and Article III apply with equal force—that a litigant cannot just rely on speculative injuries to keep the case alive. So mootness and standing should not be interpreted to be that different from each other because both are implementing Article III’s case or controversy requirement.\n\nAnd that’s why, as I was mentioning to another judge earlier, I think we shouldn’t interpret the two exceptions to mootness that make it more flexible than standing unmoored from the purposes for which those exceptions were developed, which was really evasion of judicial review and, in particular, with voluntary cessation.\n\nJudge: But isn’t—Justice Scalia suggested that the voluntary cessation exception really is about whether or not the case is moot to begin with. It’s not as though we’re accepting that it’s moot under a circumstance in which the government takes him off the No Fly List and then we’re looking at whether there is an exception to mootness in this situation. Instead, we’re saying has the government actually mooted the case when it takes him off the No Fly List, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I’m not sure about that. I mean, Justice Scalia dissented in Friends of the Earth.\n\nJudge: Yes, he did.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And he actually would have accepted the mootness as just standing in a time frame. And so, if you accept that, we’re happy if you accept that because we definitely win this case then.\n\nThere is no question that if the plaintiff had filed his suit the day after being removed from the No Fly List, he wouldn’t have had standing at all, and there would be no Article III jurisdiction there. So, really, to keep his No Fly List claims alive depends on this delta between mootness and standing, even though both implement Article III.\n\nAnd the only way to get there is through voluntary cessation. And there, I think you shouldn’t interpret it to be so unmoored from its purposes that—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Plaintiff’s Lawyer?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government agrees that when a defendant voluntarily ceases conduct challenged in litigation, it has a heavy burden to make absolutely clear that the conduct could not reasonably be expected to recur.\n\nBut the government’s declaration just promises the plaintiff that he won’t be put back on the No Fly List based on currently available information. That’s inadequate for three reasons.\n\nFirst, if our client was previously listed for attending the wrong mosque and attends that same mosque this year, the declaration would allow the government to relist him.\n\nIt gets worse. Even if he doesn’t attend again, but the government gets new suspicion-inducing information—not about him but about the mosque itself—the declaration likewise allows the government to relist him.\n\nAny new fact not currently known to the government would allow the plaintiff to be relisted, consistent with the declaration. And if he is relisted in either of those ways, that’s recurrence of the challenged conduct.\n\nHe is disadvantaged in the same fundamental way his complaint was meant to redress. Imagine if Nike had promised Already not to bring any trademark claim based on currently available information but could sue for infringement based on new information. Under those facts, the Court couldn’t have concluded that Already could move on with its business free from suit.\n\nSecond, the government’s declaration does nothing to guarantee the plaintiff notice or a hearing if he is relisted and, therefore, does not address his procedural due process claim at all.\n\nThe government’s response is that it has no current plans to relist him, but it insists on retaining the right to do so. And that’s its prerogative, but if it does relist him, there is a hundred percent certainty that his procedural claim will recur.\n\nThird, because the government hasn’t disclosed either to the plaintiff or to a court why he was listed, a court can’t possibly say anything clearly at all about whether recurrence is reasonably likely or not, and the plaintiff cannot move on with his life in the way the lawsuit was meant to allow.\n\nHe doesn’t know why he was listed. He doesn’t know what might cause him to be relisted. He doesn’t know if the next time he worships at a mosque or travels abroad he might be relisted, massively disrupting his life once again.\n\nThe plaintiff is peaceful, a law-abiding U.S. citizen. He has a live controversy against the government and seeks only to litigate that case on the merits. That’s it. I welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: How would the government’s declaration have to be amended in order to satisfy your notion of mootness?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nFor the substantive due process claim, if the government submitted a declaration either to us or to the Court itself disclosing the reasons and made a promise that matched up with those reasons not to repeat them or invoke them or similar ones, we think that could moot the substantive due process claim.\n\nFor the procedural due process claim, if the government describes, okay, we didn’t have notice, now there’s notice, you didn’t have a meaningful opportunity to rebut the evidence against you, now here’s a meaningful opportunity to rebut the evidence against you—in doing that, they would be able to moot the procedural due process claim.\n\nJudge: So you actually—you want repudiation then?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, Your Honor, we don’t believe that repudiation is required. We don’t think that the lower court required repudiation.\n\nBut what we do is we agree with the government that repudiation is one kind of evidence that shows that the likelihood of recurrence is lower. And, here, the evidence is not neutral.\n\nThe government didn’t take no position on its past conduct. They doubled down. And so that counts against the government in meeting its burden.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "732", "dialogue": "Judge: So you're not here petitioning this Court for any orders related to future hearings or anything else, right?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: I mean, you got the reasons in this case, but I thought we were here because it's the government's argument that they shouldn't have had to have given them, given the fact that Ms. Munoz in the government's view has no liberty interest and therefore no procedural due process rights. And those are the questions that we would be answering, not anything about how you would use this information that you now have to try to vindicate her rights in the consulate?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct, all we're asking for is the chance.\n\nJudge: You're the Respondent. The government has petitioned. And if we did nothing, you'd be fine, right, because you didn't want us to take this case?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: All right. So let me ask you, do we need to roll back or change the doctrine of consular non-reviewability in order for you to win in this case?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. I think that the Court's position in Trump against Hawaii gets us where we need to be on that.\n\nJudge: Why is that? Say a little bit more.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Because the doctrine of consular non-reviewability does not apply to American citizens. The government—the executive branch—cannot restrict review without a statutory provision granting it the ability to strip review. This is not a case where Congress has gone anywhere near that. The citations which the government pulls up in its brief do not—\n\nJudge: So we have never applied the doctrine of consular non-reviewability in the context of an American citizen, you're saying?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Court has always reviewed the merits of claims brought by American citizens—constitutional claims—that's correct, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: And any such review in this situation—so let's say we disagree with you on that. Let's say we disagree. The doctrine of consular non-reviewability applies, but it appears from Mandel that we have recognized an exception to it. Is that how you understand at least the government's secondary argument in this case?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It's a pretty important exception from the standpoint of separation of powers, but yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: All right. So we're into Mandel even if there is the doctrine of non-reviewability. And so why would you say that you win, given the Mandel standard? I mean, they didn't win in that case.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Because—I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Yes.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Because here, unlike in Mandel—in that case, the professor had violated a prior visa. The Court held that there was a factual basis for the Attorney General's denial of a fully discretionary waiver. Here you have a non-discretionary statute requiring reason to believe there's no factual basis for the denial. And, therefore, the government hasn't established that the denial was facially legitimate and bona fide.\n\nJudge: Final question: Would you be okay with an analysis that assumed the first question presented?\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: If we were to prevail on the second question? (Laughter.)\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I do think, honestly, that the Court has to reach the first question in order to rule in favor of us.\n\nJudge: You think we have to say; we can't just assume it and then—\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Right? Because you can't assume it—\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think it would be breaking—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —any new ground to recognize the importance of marriage in this case, though, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Gannon?\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could just make three points. First, I still haven't heard a clear explanation as to why this constitutional right, whether it's a procedural or a substantive one, should be limited to spouses or the effects on visas.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: My friend said that no one else, other than a spouse, would have the right to petition under the statute as it currently exists for this type of relief, but if this is a constitutional liberty interest underlying this, I'm not sure why people wouldn't be able to say the inability to make those petitions is unconstitutional. And so—and no Court has countenanced that type of argument in any other context.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Second, my friend talks about the domestic context, talks about what DHS does when there are proceedings in the United States, which obviously implicate different interests because somebody is here and they—there is a mechanism for some judicial review there, but it's important to recall here that state is the first line of defense on these issues.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And if they deny a visa on the basis of somebody being inadmissible and that person doesn't come here, then there isn't going to be any judicial inquiry. If they deny a visa and that person does come here and DHS wants to remove that person, then the fact that they came here without a visa is an independent ground of inadmissibility. And so they'd be much more likely to be charged with that than the expectation that they would be engaged in unlawful activity while they are here in the United States.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And, third, if I could get to the colloquy with Justice Gorsuch, and my friend talked about the determination that this ground of inadmissibility was permanent and cited page 16 of the joint appendix. The letter that is included there is one that simply said that this determination of inadmissibility is not waivable.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there's not a procedure for getting us to consider whether we're going to make an exception the way DHS had done here on the ground of inadmissibility associated with his previous unlawful presence in the United States. That doesn't say that this is a permanent basis of inadmissibility.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: He can reapply for a visa and present whatever evidence he wants to persuade us that we were wrong the first time around, but that's not the same thing as saying that there is a judicially overseen procedure for rehearing that would allow the courts to consider whether our reasons are correct.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: He said that he wants our inadmissibility finding to be declared incorrect, and so we would disagree that that's what any court should be doing on remand here. The point of Mandel is not to allow for meaningful opportunities to respond or further internal appeals or further judicial review.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The Court in Mandel was clear. Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Din was clear that there's no testing or looking behind the court's decision. And my friend said that in Mandel the government showed that there was the fact that he had previously violated the terms of previous entries. That was a hotly contested issue in the case. The dissent said that was a sham and there was no evidence in the record to support it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The majority said we're not testing or looking behind the government's assertion. This is not about allowing courts to police whether the government's reasoning is correct. The consular officer has to have a reason to believe that this person is inadmissible in order to deny the visa, but that is not judicially reviewable.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We urge the Court to reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

{"id": "1020", "dialogue": "Defendant's Lawyer: But this Court has said that \"otherwise\" in a criminal statute means similar conduct, so we --\n\nJudge: Similar conduct, obstruction of a proceeding, different ways of carrying out that similar conduct, which is obstruction of a proceeding. The statute tells you what the similar conduct is right on its face.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, respectfully, the statute tells you what the effect is. The conduct that's specified in (c)(1) is altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing a document, record, or other object. And so a drafter of this statute could easily omit something like that and would omit something like that for the sake of economy and also to hedge because we know that what comes before might not be exactly the same as after, so we're not going to repeat what we said there, but we're going to use a connector like \"otherwise\" to demonstrate that we're talking about similar conduct. And I would submit that if you look at (c)(2) alone, that is - please.\n\nJudge: What's your best case for this, like, going backward and trying to find language that does not appear in the \"otherwise\" provision and trying to incorporate it into the \"otherwise\" provision?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think Begay is our best case for sure.\n\nJudge: And that's not --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yates also.\n\nJudge: -- a very good advertisement, I would think. I mean, what Begay does is exactly that. So you have a very good case there. And it was a complete failure. You know, Begay said we look back at this other -- at this thing that Congress, you know, did not use in the \"otherwise\" provision and we derive various things from it and we put it in. It was purposeful, violent, and aggressive. And then, a few years later, we said, where did that come from? We made it up, and we get rid of the whole thing. So that's not a great advertisement for rewriting a statute to take an \"otherwise\" provision that says what it says and turn it into an \"otherwise\" provision that says something else.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We would submit that Begay was abrogated on other grounds. And the other grounds are the Court could not decide between an assessment of the types of things that came before \"otherwise\" versus the level of risk. And when that began to play out in complicated cases like Chambers and many others involving escape from a halfway house, it became a -- the Court said, an untenable proposition to figure out what a potential harm to another person might be looking at what came before. That doesn't --\n\nJudge: Well --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That doesn't --\n\nJudge: I'm sorry, go ahead, finish your sentence.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, but that doesn't mean that the Court's holding about how to construe a statute and its significant holding about \"otherwise\" was abrogated in and of itself as a result of the cases that came after Begay.\n\nJudge: Well, I'm not a fan of Begay. Some of us perceived at that time that there were problems, different problems, with what the Court did there. But I think there's a point in the colloquy that you've been having. The specific types of conduct that are enumerated in (1), alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal a record, document, et cetera, et cetera, have two things in common. One, they all involve documents or objects, and they also all involve the impairment of the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding. So the similarity could be either of those things. And so I think that you may be biting off more than you can chew by suggesting, if you are indeed suggesting, that the \"otherwise\" clause can only be read the way you read it. One might say it can certainly be read the way the government reads it, and that might even be the more straightforward reading. But it is also possible to read a clause like this more narrowly, and an example of that was provided in a previous opinion. If you have a statute that says anyone who kills or injures or assaults someone or otherwise causes serious injury, commits a crime, you wouldn't think that that applies to defamation. So it could be read your way. So then I think you have to go on to some other arguments and explain why your reading is better than the government's reading.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Certainly. And I would submit that there are plenty of other reasons why our reading is the better reason. And I'm not going to contest or bite off more than I can chew and say that the government's reading of (c)(2) is implausible. We think it's unsound, but it's unsound for the additional reasons that if one zooms out and looks at what the prohibited conduct is in 1512 generally, we are talking about interference or operation on forms of evidence and testimony that obstruct a proceeding. That's what 12 is all about generally. And I would submit, too, that as the briefing indicates, ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis, those two venerated Latin canons, also operate in our favor here, as well as the broader context of Chapter 73 and Section 15. All of these things are about doing things that obstruct a proceeding. And 1512 and 1512(c) zero in on witnesses and evidence.\n\nJudge: Well, you have other arguments. You have surplusage arguments. You have arguments about the breadth of the government's reading of the provision. Do you want to say anything about those?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. So, with respect to surplusage, I would refer to a prior opinion, in particular, which lists out all of the different provisions in Section 1512. Fifteen of the 21 would be subsumed by the government's reading of (c)(2). The government's reading of (c)(2), I'd remind the Court, is so broad that it would cover anyone who does something understanding that what they are doing is wrong in some way that in any way influence, impedes or obstructs an official proceeding of any type.\n\nJudge: Well, I think that this --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Maybe limited by federal.\n\nJudge: -- this -- this -- there's a good case that this provision -- everybody knew it was going to be superfluous because it was a provision that was meant to function as a backstop. It was a later-enacted provision. Congress had all these statutes all over the place. It had just gone through Enron. What Enron convinced them of was that there were gaps in these statutes. And they tried to fill the gaps. They tried to fill the particular gap that they found out about in Enron. And then they said, you know, this is a lesson to us. There are probably other gaps in this statute. But they didn't know exactly what those gaps were. So they said, let's have a backstop provision. And this is their backstop provision. And, of course, in that circumstance -- I mean, superfluity is very often a good argument when it comes to statutory interpretation, but it's not a good argument when Congress is specifically devising a backstop provision to fill gaps that might exist -- they don't exactly know how they exist, but they think that they probably do exist -- in a preexisting statutory scheme. And that's what this provision is intended to do.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Respectfully, a close reading of Yates, both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinion, demonstrates that this Court thought that 1519 was the backstop. That was supposed to be the omnibus provision. And the Court was fighting over what the meaning of \"tangible object\" was in 1519. But that was meant to plug the hole that Congress --\n\nJudge: Counsel, I have such a hard time with the superfluity argument because this entire obstruction section is superfluity. There isn't one provision you can point to -- you just said it, you can point to 1512 and you have 1519, which says destruction of evidence. How are they different? They're really not.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think you can reconcile --\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "237", "dialogue": "Judge: So I guess I'm still a little confused about how your rule works. I apologize for that.\n\nJudge: But it was suggested that you're saying that expert testimony about modus operandi and actus reus is fine to come in, but expert testimony about mental state is not.\n\nJudge: So I don't know what happens with battered women syndrome, which is testimony about the mental state of the defendant. Are you saying that's in or out and why?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So mental state in general is okay. So an expert can say: I believe this defendant has battered women syndrome. I believe this defendant, to use an example, has schizophrenia.\n\nJudge: I thought that's exactly what the rule says you're not supposed to have an expert do.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, no, no. What the rule says is the mental state required as an element of the crime.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So there are general—\n\nJudge: And in a certain case, the element we were talking about was the defense, that the defendant was saying they were insane.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And so I thought the rule was that you were not supposed to have dueling experts talk about whether or not the defendant was insane.\n\nJudge: So I'm positing a situation in which the question is: Is this person guilty of assault? And they would like to put on a defense that they had battered women’s syndrome.\n\nJudge: That goes to their mental state.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: In or out?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Some yes, some no. But this is a very important question, so I want to make sure I get it right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: To use an example, you could have dueling testimony as to whether or not the defendant had schizophrenia. That’s not the element of the offense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You could have dueling testimony as to whether or not the defendant had hallucinations, delusions, or difficulty perceiving reality. That’s not the element of the crime.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The element of the crime is being able to tell right from wrong. That’s what you could not have testimony about.\n\nJudge: But it says element of the crime or defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, but the defense is still negating the mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the critical thing is to pinpoint the mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In the assault case, the mens rea would be something like a reasonable belief that the defendant was acting in self-defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: An expert can take the stand and say, \"I believe this person has battered women syndrome.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Here are characteristics of battered women syndrome: There's a cycle of abuse, there's learned helplessness, there's difficulty leaving—all things that are not the element of whether or not the defendant believed their life was in danger when they acted.\n\nJudge: So you—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —she believed her life was in danger when she acted.\n\nJudge: You disagree with the suggestion that all that's off the table because it's mental state evidence. We have to do some sort of fine—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don’t know whether I’m disagreeing with that, but—\n\nJudge: Okay. All right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —at least what I want to say is mental state evidence, to just give another lay example, \"I believe people in this situation are nervous.\" That would be perfectly fine.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It’s a mental state, but it’s not going to be the element of the crime or a defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: All I’m saying is that Rule 704(b) keeps out that last step—assigning the mens rea to the defendant.\n\nJudge: Okay. One final question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: What about intent to distribute? That is a pretty standard charge.\n\nJudge: Drugs with intent to distribute.\n\nJudge: And you have an expert who comes in.\n\nJudge: And in my experience, this is also pretty standard.\n\nJudge: The police walk into the apartment, there’s all this paraphernalia and chemicals and stuff that a layperson might not understand.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And so the expert that the government puts on the stand says: \"In my expertise, people who have this kind of material in these quantities in their apartments have it because they’re manufacturing drugs that they intend to sell.\"\n\nJudge: In or out?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Things about the way the drug operation might work, things about what those pieces of equipment do or don't do with regard to drugs would be okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But a direct statement of intent would be not okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The D.C. Circuit has explained this very clearly and other courts have held that. So—\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its plain terms, Rule 704(b) comes into play only when the expert is offering an opinion about the defendant's own mental state. That's the key textual limitation that resolves this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Agent Flood's testimony did not violate Rule 704(b) for the simple reason that he did not express any opinion at all about whether Petitioner herself knew about the drugs hidden in her car.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Indeed, he did not mention Petitioner a single time in his entire testimony.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The Court should reject Petitioner's invitation to replace the line drawn in the text of Rule 704(b) with one of her own invention. According to Petitioner, Rule 704(b) prohibits a novel and amorphous category of what she has called class-wide mens rea testimony. That proposal cannot be squared with the text, purpose, or history of the rule.\n\nJudge: But Mr. Fisher makes the point that in effect when you talk about the probabilities of someone carrying drugs, that you are in effect talking about the defendant, that you could only be concerned about the conduct of the defendant. So how would you respond to that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think my friend on the other side is conflating two distinct issues in this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: One is whether the expert is offering an opinion that is about the defendant herself.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Agent Flood did not do that here when he testified in general terms that drug traffickers do not entrust large quantities of drugs to people who are unaware of those—\n\nJudge: Well, his point is that it wouldn't be relevant otherwise if you weren't talking about the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think that's right, Your Honor.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It's true that it is relevant because we are asking the jury to infer something about the defendant herself, about Petitioner herself, from the expert's opinion.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But that doesn't make it an opinion—it doesn't mean the expert is expressing an opinion about the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: When Rule 704(b) talks about expressing an opinion about the defendant, it means expressing an opinion framed in terms of the defendant's own mental state.\n\nJudge: So if I understand it right, for relevance purposes it has to be about the defendant, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, I think that's what makes the testimony relevant.\n\nJudge: But that's the only way in which you get this evidence in, in the first place.\n\nJudge: It has to be about the defendant. We're not talking about some stranger to the suit, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, I agree—\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "620", "dialogue": "Judge: Counsel, can I ask you whether -- let's imagine that we agree with you. On remand, do you agree that the government could take a shot at proving that your client actually did try to interfere with or, under (c)(1) -- or, actually, no -- sorry -- under (c)(2), obstruct evidence because he was trying to obstruct the arrival of the certificates arriving to the vice president's desk for counting? So there would be an evidence impairment theory?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm quite sure that my friend would take a shot, Your Honor, but I would say no, and the reason why is that this statute prohibits operation on specific evidence in some way, shape, or form. Attempting to stop a vote count or something like that is a very different act than actually changing a document or altering a document or creating a fake new document.\n\nJudge: Well, he's obstructing evidence in my hypothetical. I mean, he's not actually altering the vote certificates, which is why I corrected myself and said under (c)(2). I mean, would that be different than someone, say, in a trial or a criminal proceeding trying to prevent evidence that was going to be introduced in the proceeding from making it there? So I'm imagining him acting on the certificates, not the act of counting them.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, again, I think they can try it, but I don't think that we're talking about trying to impair just anything other than the evidence itself. We're trying to obstruct a proceeding, and there are questions about what \"proceeding\" means here, as Your Honor doubtless knows. But what the government would essentially be doing, as you noted, is converting what they've charged in (c)(2) to a (c)(1) type of crime.\n\nJudge: Well, no, no, no, no, no. (c)(2) -- I mean, as I -- maybe I'm misunderstanding your argument, but I thought your argument was that (c)(2) picks up other things, but they just have to be evidence-related. So, in the hypothetical I'm giving you, it's evidence-related because it's focused on the certificates, but it's obstruct, obstruct or impede, say, the certificates arriving to the vice president's desk insofar as the goal was to shut down the proceeding and therefore interfere with the evidence reaching the vice president.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I still -- that's closer. It's definitely closer. But, if you zoom out and look at all of 1512 in order to understand what kinds of impairment we're talking about, we are talking about -- or Congress is prohibiting -- the kinds of impairments that actually change documents that actually affect their integrity. If it's just impeding or delaying, we'd submit actually that that is not part of 1512(c). Delays are mentioned in five other parts of 1512 but not in (c).\n\nJudge: But, Mr. Green, if -- if -- if the previous question was wrong, then what work is (c)(2) doing? I mean, it seems like you've just now re-articulated only the theory of (c)(1) and you're saying that you have to make it into (c)(1) in order to be -- you know, to have this statute apply. So can you help me at least understand under your theory what additional thing does (c)(2) offer?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Let's look at the verbs of (c)(1), which are alter, destroy, mutilate, and conceal, and let's think about their antonyms. So one instead of destroy would be actually to create. So one could use some sophisticated computer program -- we've heard an awful lot about AI, and we've heard about the possibility of deepfake photographs. So I think you would violate (c)(2) if you created a photograph that established your alibi in some extremely sophisticated way that would get it admitted into evidence or make it -- or you submit it for evidence would probably be where the crime occurs.\n\nJudge: So you're saying there are other things other than particularly altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing, but it has to be limited to a record?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Not necessarily, because, I mean, one other example if I might, Your Honor, would be not to conceal but to disclose. So, if I disclosed a witness list in a large multi-defendant drug trial, my purpose in doing that, though I haven't altered the document, would be to intimidate the witnesses or prevent their attendance. That, on our submission, would also violate (c)(2).\n\nJudge: All right. Can I just ask you one other question just so that I can fully understand your theory? You keep using the term \"evidence.\" And that does not appear in the statute. The statute (c)(1) says record, document, or other object. Now I appreciate that, you know, evidence can be such a thing, but you can imagine a world in which those two are different. So where does evidence come in in your theory and why is it there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the title of the statute refers to tampering with witnesses, victims, and informants. But along with witnesses, victims, and informants comes evidence that they provide, whether in the form of testimony or whether in the form of documents.\n\nJudge: No, I understand. But the statute, the provision we're talking about here, does not use the term \"evidence.\" And so -- and instead or in addition, it uses the term \"official proceeding,\" which is elsewhere defined not in terms of, you know, court proceedings or investigations. It's just a proceeding, you know, before Congress. So is it your argument that the only thing that this provision covers is something that is tantamount to evidence in an investigation or trial?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It is, Your Honor. And we're not limiting it -- our position does not limit it to documents or records. I would submit (c)(1), which we say carries into (c)(2) through the \"otherwise\" clause, when it says \"other object,\" is pretty broad. And it need not be -- as 1512(f) provides, it need not be admissible. So it could cover things like electronic records. It could cover communications. It could cover emails. It could cover all kinds of things that we think get used by fact finders in a formally convened hearing.\n\nJudge: What about the Second Circuit's decision in U.S. versus Reich, where what was involved was not evidence, it was a forged court order. Would that fall within (c)(2)?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, we think that does fall within (c)(2). And I think anything that is falsified in this operative way that is used to obstruct a proceeding would be covered by (c)(2).\n\nJudge: All right. Thank you.\n\nJudge: And just to take you back to the question that started this, I mean, there, it seems to me there are two choices here, and you could read this as \"otherwise obstructs a proceeding\" or \"otherwise spoils evidence.\" And you're using it to say \"otherwise spoils evidence\" with \"spoils\" being all those verbs. But it doesn't say that. It says \"otherwise obstructs a proceeding.\"\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "875", "dialogue": "Judge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- that the law is burdening our speech.\r\n\r\nThen you have to look at whether the law itself is somehow content-based, not just what their motivations are but whether the law is content-based.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, the trigger for this law, the one thing that gets it going, is if you operate a social media platform that has user-generated content, unless that content takes the form of a product, travel, or business review.\r\n\r\nThen, within that universe of content, it says there's one speaker we're particularly concerned about, and we're going to hammer home on that one speaker.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just to make the rubble bounce, they come in and tell us that one of the reasons they're targeting that speaker is because they're worried about the future content on that platform, that it could in the future somehow be critical of the United States or undermine democracy, to pull examples from the government's brief.\r\n\r\nSo I think there's no way to get around the fact that this is a content-based speech restriction and you do have to go directly to what their interests are.\r\n\r\nNow their principal interest is --\r\n\r\nJudge: Could -- could I -- because I think I'm a little bit surprised by one of the answers that you gave to the other judge.\r\n\r\nI had understood that the company's essential complaint here is that they wouldn't be able to use the algorithm that their parent company has invented and that they want to use the algorithm that their parent company has invented.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: One hundred percent. And if I -- if I was unclear on that, Your Honor, I apologize.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nBecause I think --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: That is absolutely the core of the claim.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- what the other judge was saying to you is, like, what's the problem here because the parent company is a foreign company.\r\n\r\nOr maybe this isn't what the other judge says; it's just what I say.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nJudge: The parent company is a foreign company.\r\n\r\nAnd you started off with another judge saying, you know, well, we would be making a different argument.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, that's true.\r\n\r\nI mean, I would think that precedent makes it pretty clear that you have to be making a different argument with respect to a foreign state or a foreign company.\r\n\r\nSo let's -- let's say that they don't have First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nThe only First Amendment rights lie in the company, which does have First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nAnd I -- I guess my question is, how are those First Amendment rights really being implicated here? This -- this statute says the foreign company has to divest.\r\n\r\nWhether or not that's feasible, however long it takes, the company still has the ability to use whatever algorithm it wants, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: No, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nAnd their rights are implicated at a most basic level.\r\n\r\nIn 10 days, the company wants to speak.\r\n\r\nIn 10 days, because this law was passed, the company cannot speak unless the parent company executes a qualified divestiture.\r\n\r\nThat's not just the parent company's choice. That is a -- that is a condition --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, I realize --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- that's imposed by law.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- that it has -- it definitely has effects on the company if the parent company acts in the way that you're assuming it will act.\r\n\r\nSo -- so this is not to say that the First Amendment isn't involved because the company is going to suffer some pretty severe incidental effects, but they are incidental, aren't they? Because the statute only says to this foreign company divest or else and -- and leaves the company with the ability --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- to do what every other actor in the United States can do, which is go find the best available algorithm.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\r\n\r\nI very much disagree that the effects are incidental because the way that this law works is it is only triggered if somebody is engaging in speech based on their content, user-generated content, except for business, product, and travel reviews.\r\n\r\nIt then singles out a single speaker.\r\n\r\nAnd you have the concession for the government that one of the reasons they've singled out that speaker --\r\n\r\nJudge: That puts a lot of emphasis on the idea of just like -- you know, I think what you're basically saying is that all speaker-based restrictions generate strict scrutiny.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that we've ever said anything like that.\r\n\r\nYou know, let's put aside the facial -- your argument that this is facially content-based.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that your stronger argument or at least the one that most interested me was this argument of, look, if the government is doing something specifically for the purpose of changing the content that people see, that has to be subject to strict scrutiny. But I don't see that as -- as affecting the company as opposed to as affecting the parent company, that --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, no, no, I -- I very much do see it as affecting the company because they choose this algorithm because it reflects the mix of content.\r\n\r\nThe government's fear is that another country could come in and pressure the company, the company, through the parent company, to alter that mix of content to make it too pro-foreign or too anti-American.\r\n\r\nThat is very much directly a content-based charge straight at the company.\r\n\r\nThe other point I would like to --\r\n\r\nJudge: I -- I hear you that it might very well have that effect.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm suggesting is that the law is only targeted at this foreign corporation, which doesn't have First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nWhatever effect it has, it has.\r\n\r\nYou know, maybe the parent company will figure out a way to, like, put this on open source, and then the company will be able to use the algorithm.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So, Your Honor, if I could take that on directly, because, to the -- I think the company has First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nTo the extent the parent company is speaking in the United States, it, I believe, has First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nIf you conclude that neither has First Amendment rights, then, surely, the creators have First Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nBut, if you take a step back, what their position is is that none of these entities -- this is the universe of entities affected by this law -- none of these entities have the authority to assert First Amendment rights, which means that the government really could come in and say: I'm going to shut down this company because it's too pro-Republican or too pro-Democrat or won't disseminate the speech I want, and that would get no First Amendment scrutiny by anybody. That cannot possibly be the case, yet that is the effect of their position.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: We think that's the minimum that should be done here.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nWe -- we've been talking about connection between the regulation of -- of the company and the burden on expressive conduct. And your basic position is that interfering with the ownership of the company constitutes a direct regulation of the expressive conduct of other -- other people. What -- what is your best example in our precedent of a situation where we've -- a regulation of corporate structure or something else has been treated as a direct regulation of expressive conduct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: The regulation of a corporate structure as a --\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't have a case in my fingertips.\r\n\r\nI can consider it when we come back on --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, I don't have one at my fingertips or any other part of my body.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "661", "dialogue": "Judge: -- it's not a flood -- it's not a floodgates argument. It's a constitutional argument. It's how we determine which interests are sufficient to allow the citizen, the American citizen, to contest the denial of a visa for a -- a close relative or a -- a person with whom the person has a close relationship who's not an American citizen.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, this is a case about marriage, Your Honor, and this is a case about the importance of marriage. And this Court has recognized this. Congress for over 200 years has recognized this even in the immigration context. 1804 was the first time immigration benefits passed through citizenship. 1888, at the peak of Chinese exclusion, Congress passed the Scott Act, which exempted Chinese laborers who had wives in the United States.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lee, I -- I --I guess what I'm not seeing, to me, there's no weighing at issue here. The way I understand the analysis worked -- as working is that if you come forward with a constitutional right, whether it's the right to listen to ideas from somebody overseas or --or certainly whether it's the right to associate with your spouse who is overseas, if you come forward with a constitutional right of that kind in cohabiting or associating with a person who is not getting a visa, that gets you something, but it doesn't get you weighing. It gets you this very limited judicial review which says the government now has to say why it's excluding that person. So that's all it gets you. It's just like you come forward with a right. We don't weigh that right. It just gives you the ability to force the government to say one or two sentences about why they're excluding that person. So what weighing are we talking about?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I think Your Honor put it better than I did. I mean, we have here a very important constitutional interest. It would certainly not make sense if Mr. Asencio-Cordero could ask a professor to get his next visa and get in that way but not because he had lived with his wife for five years and --\n\nJudge: Right. But that brings us back to this question of, okay, you got what you wanted. You got the information --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: -- that they were excluding the spouse because of gang activities. And then that brings us back to the previous questions about why isn’t this whole thing over because you got what you wanted.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because now for the first time we're going to have the opportunity to go back and harness the facts that’s necessary to try and prove the government wrong. We don’t have the right to win on remand. We’ll go back to the consulate. We’ll do our very best. There is a lot of information that we can do with the reasons that were ultimately given. It doesn’t give us any guarantee, but that’s what due process requires.\n\nJudge: But Mandel -- and -- and this is just a question about the constitutional argument, this is -- kind of goes back to the questions I was asking before. Mandel talks about notice and giving you the basis, but it doesn’t talk about Mullane and an opportunity to be heard. And you're weighing, I take it, is probably coming from Mathews versus Eldridge, which I don't think is the standard here. So where do we get the constitutional right to an opportunity to be heard in this Mandel context?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, keep in mind that in Mandel there was a broad discretionary grant. We think that that’s a foundational difference between Mandel and this case. And so, because this is a --this is a nondiscretionary decision which Congress has established, officers must have this reason to believe, we think that that does a lot to get us to where we need to be, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. I understood you to indicate that what you thought the relief you were seeking was just limited judicial review. Is that right? Or exactly what is the relief you’re seeking?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We do not need any additional judicial review here, Your Honor. I think, on remand, this will go quickly to the consulate so that we can finally respond to the information that we’ve been given.\n\nJudge: And how do you come to the fact or the conclusion that that is what you’re entitled to when you’re discussing the right of a married couple to have one of them come in, you know, across -- across the border? How do you get to the determination that that’s what you’re entitled to?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, we get to it because Ms. Munoz is directly implicated, and that’s where the statute comes in.\n\nJudge: But that gives her some sort of standing, but you said when you -- I don’t want to give it away -- when you’d look at the marriage interest and the international interest on the United States, what you’d conclude is that you get this limited judicial review.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I see. Yes. Going forward, that’s the rule.\n\nJudge: And you do that by doing what?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, we do that by requiring that there is -- I mean, we’ve had some discussion as to whether the facially legitimate and bona fide test applies or whether something slightly more strenuous applies.\n\nJudge: I don’t care what the test is. What is it that the tests entail?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The test is entailed at determining that the government did not make a decision which either has no basis in reality or which was violative of the rights of a U.S. citizen.

Right.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: But, if I were to challenge my federal disability benefit claim, identical claim, just against a different government, here, instead of the state, the federal government, you'd almost assuredly have to exhaust your administrative remedies before you could challenge that decision, and I'm -- I'm just curious how you reconcile that fact with -- with the relief you seek here.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I'm actually not sure that's the case if it's the type of claim we're asserting here.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Like, suppose you filed a Social Security claim and it was stuck in the agency for five, 10, 15 years.\n\nJudge: You'd have a futility argument for sure.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think you'd be able to go to federal court.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nJudge: But, otherwise, you'd have to exhaust, right?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Right, unless --\n\nJudge: And that's what I'm getting at, okay? So, on the federal system, you have an exhaustion requirement with a futility exception.\n\nJudge: Assuming Alabama recognizes a futility exception -- and I'll have that question for counsel, I've done a little research on it, it seems to have one -- why shouldn't the state be allowed to have the exact parallel situation that you'd have on the federal system?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I guess I think that argument is incompatible with -- with the Felder case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I mean, look at all the reasoning of the Felder case.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think it would rebut that -- that suggestion.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I mean, the Court held that it's -- the state is not permitted to put that type of barrier in front of the vindication of the full right.\n\nJudge: What -- what does Felder -- because that is the linchpin of your argument, is that we've already decided this. So what does -- what kind of state procedural rules or rules does Felder still leave, and how would you define the scope of that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So Felder left two categories of rules that the State could apply in its own courts.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: One are neutral procedural rules.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So it gave the example of rules governing substitution of parties and service of process, rules that don't just apply to plaintiffs who sue governmental defendants. And then the second category was certain jurisdictional rules.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And Haywood elaborated on this.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The Court said that jurisdictional rules that reflect concerns over competence over the subject matter and the power over the person, that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So, you know, examples of such rules would be like in the -- the Herb case, a jurisdictional rule that a territory -- a city court can only hear cases arising from its territorial limits.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The Court upheld such a rule.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Or a case saying that the state won't exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants if it's an out-of-state plaintiff. The Court upheld such a rule in the Douglas case from 1929.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So those are the types of jurisdictional rules --\n\nJudge: Do you --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- that would --\n\nJudge: -- do you view Felder as a preemption decision then?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes, I view Felder as a preemption decision.\n\nJudge: And what -- on what basis was the preemption?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the Court talked about purposes and objectives preemption in its opinion.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And we actually have no problem with that.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: We agree with all of its analysis.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I actually think there would be a -- there's a straighter path to the result in Felder.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I just think there's a -- a direct conflict because, when the Court holds that an affirmative defense is not available, it just means it's not available, regardless of whether the adjudicator is a federal or state judge.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I view sort of direct -- I view Felder as a direct conflict preemption case. The Court did couch it in -- in purposes and objectives language, possibly because, in that case, it actually wasn't clear whether it was an exhaustion requirement at all.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Unlike typical exhaustion requirements, you don't have to wait for the agency to rule.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And so one of Wisconsin's arguments in that case was this isn't exhaustion like in Patsy.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think that's why the Court walked through all of the -- the reasons that the statute conflicted with, you know, the purpose of Congress.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And then it said, well, actually, we think it is an exhaustion requirement, and then Patsy's reasoning just -- just follows.\n\nJudge: What -- what I guess I'm confused about from your answer to the previous question is how the jurisdictional and neutral requirements relate to the -- the analysis in Felder.\n\nJudge: I mean, Felder's rule about whether or not it was preempted didn't seem to have anything to do with whether the rule was jurisdictional or neutral.\n\nJudge: So why do you suggest that that's somehow a way to get out of Felder's analysis about preemption?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I think -- so Felder specifically said the rule in that case wasn't neutral.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So the Court has this whole discussion about how, you know, it only applies to -- to plaintiffs who sue the government.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: And so that's -- that's not neutral as the Court --\n\nJudge: Yeah, but that's not what --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- understood the question.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Section 464 and Section 465.\nSection 464 says it's only voyage -- vessels that have voyages from the East Coast in the United States to the West Coast and from a port in the United States to a port overseas, not Canada.\nAnd there's a second limit that you can't be earning a profit from the things that you're shipping.\nSo you're not -- you're not making your money because you're shipping fish and you're selling the fish.\nYou're making the money off the transportation.\nThose two limits boil down to the shipping industry, and here's where I think a little bit of history of shipping helps a lot.\nThe Panama Canal didn't open until 1914, so to get from San Francisco to Boston in 1914 was almost a nine-month journey.\nYou don't take that journey and return with an empty ship.\nThose factors that are in the Shipping Commissioners Act are isolating the industry.\nAnd it makes sense because the people who need the arbitration remedy, the seamen who need the arbitration remedy are those who are going from port to port to port to port to port, going on a new vessel every time.\nThey aren't the employees of -- of a company that's making the same journey back and forth and they're regularly employed.\n\nJudge: Except you just pointed out reasons in the statute that limited. So you're saying this wasn't just any seamen, it was seamen who met these particular restrictions.\nWell, Section 1 doesn't have that additional language.\nIt just says seamen.\nSo why wouldn't Section 1 be a broader subset of the narrower subset that you're talking about?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because, in both New Prime and in Circuit City, this Court recognized that the rich fabric upon which the Section 1 exemption was passed was the fabric of the Shipping Commissioners Act and the Railway Act.\nAnd both of those were limited in effect to the shipping industry workers, and so it would have been unusual at the time to bring in all of these seamen who, again, Petitioners concede recreational boats are in.\nSo, if you work on a yacht, you are -- and you never transport a good and you're just sightseeing with, you know, whoever owns the yacht, you're a seamen within the Section 1 construct.\nThat's not a transportation worker, and that's not what Congress was getting at.\nThey were getting at that narrow subset of workers who actually impact the national commerce and national security.\n\nJudge: But why do those workers have to be in the industry? I mean, I can agree with you that the statute is about transportation workers and, in fact, we've held that.\nSo we're not talking about -- I mean, maybe -- maybe I would disagree with the representation that you just made about people who are working on a yacht.\nMaybe.\nBut I think the line there is drawn between transportation worker and other workers.\nBoth -- you can have transportation workers in a different kind of industry.\nThat's why I don't understand where the industry limitation is coming from.\nThat's not in the statute.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I think it's coming from -- I think it is in the statute.\nI think it's falling out of the enumeration.\nAnd as Justice --\n\nJudge: But we've said the enumeration goes to transportation worker.

Got it.\nWhere is the industry coming from?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So two points.\nFirst, in -- in Saxon, I think this Court correctly recognized that it's never given an exhaustive definition of transportation worker.\nSo the industry is coming out of the fact that in 1925, seamen were the seamen on these merchant ships that run the shipping industry, yes.\n\nJudge: But what about companies in 19 -- in the 1920s that had their own fleets or own boats or railroad companies or lumber companies that had railroad workers that were their own, in-house?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They were almost outside of the Shipping Commissioners Act because they were making these little local journeys that aren't falling within the arbitration provisions.\nAnd -- and a lot's been said -- if you'd indulge me for 30 seconds, a lot's been said about the lumber schooners.\nPetitioners actually don't have the history right on lumber schooners.\nLumber schooners are a kind of boat and they were owned by syndicates.\nThe syndicates included all people within the -- you can imagine, the people who produced the lumber, the people who were trading in lumber, the people who converted the lumber to two-by-fours, and people who made paper.\nAnd they had one -- and the master of the vessel.\nAnd they had one interest, which was to keep the vessel full.\nSo to the extent that --\n\nJudge: Counsel, isn't all of this an argument for us looking at the last-leg drivers and deciding whether this was foreign or interstate commerce as understood at the time?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I --\n\nJudge: I mean, that's where I see this argument.\nI just don't see it -- I mean, by the way, as an aside, Amazon, who's an amicus on your side, doesn't agree with you, on -- on pages 5 to 7 in their brief they say the focus is not on what the employee is doing as part of its duties -- employer is doing, but what -- what the industry is.\nAnd it says it's what the employee is doing.\nTheir argument is, on what I'm saying your argument is, we have to look more carefully and more narrowly at what foreign or interstate commerce means.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, two -- two points, Your Honor.\nThe first is I doubt they liked my answer they were in the transportation industry, which might explain what they were doing on pages 5 through 7, but I do think if you disagree with us, that --\n\nJudge: Well, they're saying they're not, but they don't say that's dispositive.\nWhat they're saying is what's dispositive is that their workers are not engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And I -- I would agree that if --if you decide --I think the last mile cases are important.\nAnd I think you -- you do have to decide the last mile issue --\n\nJudge: Not here.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- as well as our issue. Not here, but it would be an issue for remand because we've -- you know, we've preserved the issue.\n\nJudge: I -- we --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But --\n\nJudge: -- don't even have to get into that.\nWhether you preserved it or not, I didn't check.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, I do think --\n\nJudge: The question is a different question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But I want -- I want to get to the heart of that question, which is, is the problem solved by last mile? And no, it's not, because, again, the background rule here until about 2020 was that the transportation industry workers were out.\nAnd that's why you're not seeing these cases arise until just the past year or so.\nAnd so the problem is you have a lot of companies who are like -- I'm just going to say Acme to keep it, you know, the record clean.\nYou have Acme Company, who actually has their own drivers who cross state lines.\nThat company doesn't see themselves -- they are not in the shipping industries in any -- in any way.\nAnd they're not preserved by the last mile.\nAnd so you start to introduce a whole class of cases.\nI mean, every -- in the modern economy, every retailer, every manufacturer has a shipping department.\nAnd those shipping departments are inevitably shipping goods in interstate commerce.\nAnd so you'd be -- in light of the fact that the background rule excluded transportation industries, you're opening a whole other area that has been -- honestly, if you look at Circuit City, this -- cases that the Court affirmed in Circuit City, the court of appeals cases, were all assuming a transportation industry component.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And what cause of action remains pending as you understand it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: They still have claims for federal due process and claims under the Texas Constitution.\n\nJudge: Would you oppose leave to amend to add a Texas constitutional claim via email?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: On behalf of the State of Texas, we would not oppose that in the district court.\n\nJudge: Okay. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Sorry, but I -- I -- I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nJudge: Point of clarification.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: Tell me how they plead this. Let's assume we affirm the court below. There's no freestanding right to come into federal court and sue Texas under the Fifth Amendment. How would they go to the Texas court and make their Fifth Amendment claim? What would they say in the Texas court?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So what they would say here, and candidly, the pleadings have never been as clear as I think anyone would have liked, but what I think they would say is, we are bringing our claim under state law, see, e.g., City of Baytown. I think that would be sufficient to get us there.\n\nJudge: That's -- that's -- my gosh. I've never heard of pleadings in any state where you had to mention the law at issue.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, that's the --\n\nJudge: Usually, you mention the facts --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: -- or you state the facts and then you --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: But putting that aside, here, they say violation of Article I, Section 17 of the Texas Constitution for the taking, damaging, or the destruction of their property. That's Count 1.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: And Count 2 says violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Summarizing, basically. I don't know what else they would have had to do in Texas court if I cite that case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It --\n\nJudge: They said, \"I'm suing you in Texas court.\" You're the one who removed to federal court.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: This seems to me like a totally made-up case because they did exactly what they had to do under Texas law. It's you who are telling me -- it's almost a bait and switch -- that you wanted to get to federal court to basically have a class action and you couldn't do it in state court, so -- but you had to fight something, which I don't know what you're fighting because you're telling me that Texas lets them have a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. There's no bait and switch here. I want to be clear on that, no bait and switch.\n\nJudge: Well, you're the one who removed.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We removed, and they didn't come back and say, \"Oh, no, you misunderstand what we're saying.\" Instead, every step along the way, they have doubled down, all the way going to certiorari review from this Court. So, if we misunderstood what they were saying --\n\nJudge: So, if they go back down and say to the district court, \"This has been remanded to the district court, all we want is just compensation under the Texas Constitution and the Fifth Amendment under that case that you're mentioning,\" that's okay and you're not going to resist that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We -- we -- we would not resist that, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: On the injunction-to-pay hypothetical, I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: I thought you were saying we don't need to answer that question in this case because Texas provides forums for compensation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. Conceptually, I don't know how you get an injunction to pay money.\n\nJudge: But -- but --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'm not familiar with that, but that's blowing apart --\n\nJudge: I -- I understand that, but even in the --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- the theoretical possibility of it is just not present here, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct, Your Honor. And, as I said, it's hard for me to quarrel with it because Texas does pay money. But, conceptually, I don't know how you get there.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: If I may --\n\nJudge: What about a declaration? What about a declaration? Is that something different?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: A declaration?\n\nJudge: Could you sue for -- for --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, my understanding of a declaratory judgment action is that it sounds in equity, not in damages. So I think it would fall within the universe of Ex parte Young-type remedies. So we wouldn't have any objection to that either, though, again, I'm a little bit shooting from the hip, so I apologize. It wasn't briefed on that one, so I'm -- I'm a bit nervous on that.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Though, I mean, if I -- if I may, I would like just to make a couple of affirmative points.\n\nJudge: Well, no, you can do that later.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Oh, I apologize, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Yeah. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?\n\nJudge: Well, why don't you quickly make an affirmative point.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I would just like to say that, as far as I am aware, Texas is the only party here that has offered evidence on the original public meaning of the actual language of the text, not the ideas, the actual language of the Constitution. And when courts looked at that language, they read it precisely the same way that Texas does now.\n\nJudge: Anything further?\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. Kneedler.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not of its own force create a cause of action against the government under the Fifth Amendment against the United States Government for damages. Numerous provisions of the Constitution make that clear, including the text of the just compensation clause itself.\n\nIt says property shall not be taken, no person -- property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. The right is not to have the property taken without compensation. It's not a right to compensation.\n\nAnd this -- it's prohibitory. It has a condition for the governmental action to be lawful. That condition is the payment of compensation. If there's not compensation, then the action is unlawful, and what lies is an injunction to cease the taking of the property.\n\nJudge: Mr. Kneedler, in the --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- brief that you filed in First English 38 years ago, you argued that the Constitution does not of its own force furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Now, in the decision in First English, Justice Rehnquist rejected the idea \"that the Constitution does not of its own force furnish a basis for the court to award money damages against the government.\" Now it seems to me that the question turns on basis.\n\nAnd what you seem to be saying is it created a general theory of what the government had to do. But that doesn't mean that anybody could take that and recover compensation. They have to go get an injunction, or they can't proceed at all because there's no cause of action?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: I mean, are you just rearguing the point that the Court rejected?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Not at all.

{"id": "141", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no serious dispute that at the time Ms. Laufer filed suit, Acheson provided no accessibility information on its reservation website, thereby excluding disabled people from using its online reservation services and engaging in unlawful discrimination under the ADA. As Congress recognized, when places of public accommodation fail to take reasonable steps to make their services available to people with disabilities, they signal that disabled people are unwelcome participants in the marketplace and contribute to their day-to-day experience of being isolated, invisible, and ignored. If the Court reaches the standing question presented by Acheson, it should reject Acheson's argument that a disabled person does not experience that dignitary harm when she encounters the accessibility barrier on Acheson's website, unless she also has travel plans that are thwarted by the discriminatory treatment. For over six decades and most notably in Havens Realty, this Court has recognized that discrimination inflicts Article III injury regardless of whether the plaintiff experiences any harm beyond the unequal treatment. What it means to personally experience discrimination on the internet is a novel question, but whether the answer is the one we've offered or the one the government proposes, Havens requires a test that focuses on what the plaintiff experiences on the website, not her underlying motive in that experience or whether any downstream injuries result. Finally, I want to return to the issue the Court started with today. Mr. Unikowsky and I are both arguing before the Court on behalf of clients that have no legal interest in the outcome of this case: Ms. Laufer because she has dismissed her complaint with prejudice and will not be bringing any more ADA suits and Acheson because it no longer owns the hotel whose reservations service the suit challenged. These circumstances render the case, at minimum, a poor vehicle for reaching the standing question. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: You started with the standing question, and you spoke of dignitary injury, and in your briefs, I think you focus on stigmatic injury. The government seems to focus on informational injury. And there seems to be a -- a difference in your characterization of the injury here. Would you spend a few minutes and explain which injury are we talking about?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Here, we're talking about a discriminatory denial of information, so it's not a pure informational injury. The discrimination aspect of it is important because, as in Havens, it's not just that you're not getting the information; you're not getting the information for a reason that conveys that you have inferior status in society. So it's inflicting a dignitary harm that you wouldn't have from a purely informational injury.\n\nJudge: I guess I could think of cases in which a denial of injury doesn't go to one's dignity or to -- doesn't create this sort of a stigmatic -- deprivation. And it -- but it seems as though the government doesn't make that second step to the injury that you're talking about. It simply -- it's talk -- it focuses more on the information that you are deprived of in order to be able to use or to make a decision about using a hotel.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. I think the government's brief does talk about this Court's jurisprudence on dignitary harm and discrimination and the fact that the Court has never required any downstream consequence for a discriminatory injury. And that's certainly the approach the Eleventh Circuit took on this issue.\n\nJudge: I agree with you that discriminatory treatment is itself an injury under our precedents and Article III, certainly in Havens Realty. The discriminatory treatment here, I think Mr. Unikowsky is saying, would have occurred at the hotel or in and that there was no discrimination in the information provided because everyone was provided the same information. I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah, thank you, Your Honor. I think that's wrong for the reasons Ms. Ross said. Under 12182, places of public accommodation cannot discriminate in the provision of services. So it's not just in access to their building. The service itself has to be provided in a way that allows people with disabilities to use it in the same way as non-disabled people. I also think this argument, when it's framed that way, really is a merits question and, under Steel Co., isn't part of the standing inquiry. I think, under Steel Co. and Lexmark and if you combine those with TransUnion and Spokeo, the Court assumes as valid Ms. Laufer's cause of action here, so you assume that the allegations in her complaint state a claim of unlawful discrimination under 12182, and then you also assume that Congress conferred a cause of action to her. And then the question is, did Congress act within its constitutional authority when it provided a cause of action here?\n\nJudge: Well, I think the -- Mr. Unikowsky's saying, particularly in the briefs, this is an Allen versus Wright kind of case, not a Havens Realty kind of case. And the distinction between those two cases -- Allen versus Wright, as you know, someone in Hawaii can't complain about discrimination that's occurring in Maine. Havens Realty, you actually personally experienced the discrimination yourself when you're, as Judge Barrett, then Judge Barrett said in Casillas, when you're lied to because of your race. So why isn't this case more like what Allen versus Wright described there?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The plaintiffs in Allen v. Wright were challenging the IRS's failure to enforce a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that required it to withhold tax-exempt status from discriminatory schools. The plaintiffs in that case had no private right to the IRS complying with the law. They were seeking to enforce a public right. And in those circumstances, they had to show that they were personally injured by the IRS's non-compliance.\n\nJudge: But I wonder whether there isn't a broader principle at stake in a case called -- like Havens. I mean, here, your client has disclaimed, has said, I'm not intending to go on vacation at all, I'm not intending to go to any hotel, I'm not intending to use the reservations service at all to look for accessible hotels, to reserve accessible hotels, to go to accessible hotels. I'm not doing any of that. So tell me how she is discriminated against by -- by the inaccuracies on this website.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The reason the case comes to the Court in -- in that posture is because injunctive relief is so elusive when you're talking about concrete travel plans. As was noted earlier, Ms. Laufer did amend her complaint in this case to say that she was going on this long road trip, but when the case was on appeal, she had already gone on the road trip. And so that's why, when we say she's disclaimed any intent of going on a trip, it's because, by the time the case was on appeal, she had already gone on the trip --\n\nJudge: Well, but that's the -- case that's before us.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: It's a case before us with a stipulation that she's not using the website for any vacation purposes --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But --\n\nJudge: -- that -- that she's -- and I think that your brief reads like -- like this too, that the harm is -- well, I'm not sure. You tell me. The harm is just, I'm a person with a disability, and I see that there is inaccurate information about accessibility, and that itself harms me, even if I have no plans or less than plans, I have -- I -- I'm just not thinking about vacations at all.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. So I'll start by saying the reason all of these tester cases or really any of these Reservation Rule cases are going to be in that posture is because you can't have concrete or even, you know, somewhat concrete travel plans and get an injunction in time. So -- so that's why these cases have been just generally litigated in this way in this pure tester posture. But the injury here, again, it's not just a denial of information. The day-to-day experience of being a disabled person is to have your world be very small because our marketplace, our places of public -- public accommodation, just ignore you. They don't see you. They don't recognize you as a potential customer or as a member of the marketplace. And so, when -- when Ms. Laufer goes to the website and she sees that she's invisible, that they are not even acknowledging her --\n\nJudge: Well, suppose she goes to --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: -- as someone who might stay there --\n\nJudge: -- the website and rather than look at accessibility information, she goes to the website and she looks at lots of pictures of places and -- and -- and says: Oh, this one doesn't have the required ramps. And, again, she's not going to those places, she has no intent of going to those places, but she sees that they don't have the required ramps and she brings suit then. Does -- does she have standing to do that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: Because I think that that's pretty similar to what is going on in this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So she does not have standing based on the pictures because she's not encountering the accessibility barrier herself. She's seeing --\n\nJudge: Well, I don't know, it's, like, right there. I mean, if you're saying it's how you experience discrimination, and I can understand that, but I'm experiencing that sense of being excluded when I see that all these hotels are set up to exclude me and others like me.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: There might be some sort of Article III argument there, but Congress certainly hasn't provided a cause of action there, unless you actually have plans to go to the hotel. And I want to go back to what Justice --\n\nJudge: Well, then -- then just to pause there for a moment, it sounds to me like you're edging right up to the Solicitor General's test. Am I missing something?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I see the intuitive appeal of the government's test. I think the government -- and -- and we are both asking this question of, how do you encounter discrimination on a website? And -- and this goes to the analogy Justice Sotomayor was making. Our position is, well, in the physical barrier context, you experience, you encounter that accessibility barrier when you visit the hotel regardless of whether you want to stay at the hotel or what your underlying motive is. So, when we translate that into the internet context, we say you encounter the accessibility barrier when you go to the website and click around. I think --\n\nJudge: Well, so maybe that's the difference. Just -- I just want to make sure I understand what the difference is is all I'm trying to do. The government says, yes, informational -- lack of information can be a form of discrimination --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- when you have some plans. Now how concrete that is, good luck, all right --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- but some interest in making a reservation. And the -- the extreme position -- the other end of the spectrum, and I think that -- I don't know, I don't know where you are on this -- is I'm just clicking around to see and I'm -- I'm looking for an absence of information. I'm going to seek out this discrimination without any plans, without any interest. It's just what I do. Is -- is that standing in your view?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. So I think that is the distinction between our position and the -- and the government's position. So the government says --\n\nJudge: Not my hypothetical.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah. The government says you have to use the website in some way. So they would, I think, say our position is akin to driving by the website, and they want you to engage with it and actually make a reservation or -- or engage with it in a way that shows you're considering making a reservation. We say in our brief, I'm not sure that distinction holds as a practical matter.\n\nJudge: Well, I'm -- not sure that it's going to be much of a pleading barrier if you were to adopt --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: -- the government's position versus your -- your client's, I think, but I'm just trying to understand what the real difference is --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, the difference is that for us, the moment you go to the website, you're encountering the barrier. You may not know you're going to encounter it, but the barrier is there.\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "460", "dialogue": "\nJudge: We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 22-674, Campos-Chaves versus Garland, and the consolidated case.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: Each of the non-citizens in these cases failed to attend a removal hearing after receiving written notice of the time and place of that hearing. Under the rule adopted by the Ninth Circuit, however, the non-citizens can rescind their in absentia removal orders based on a supposed lack of notice. That holding defies text, context, and common sense, and it threatens to unsettle hundreds of thousands of in absentia orders that have been entered over the course of nearly three decades.\n\nIn reaching that extraordinary result, the Ninth Circuit misread the statutory scheme and previous Court decisions. The Ninth Circuit is wrong that the omission of time and place information in a notice to appear renders all subsequent notices invalid.\n\nCongress created two distinct forms of notice, and it made both of them potential grounds for in absentia removal. The removal orders in these cases were based on notices of hearing that specified a new time and place for the removal proceedings and that warned the non-citizens of the consequences of failing to attend those proceedings. That’s all the law requires for a notice of hearing to be valid.\n\nAs to previous Court decisions, we acknowledge that the Court is not writing on a blank slate when it comes to notices to appear, but those decisions do not decide these cases. The question presented today was not briefed, argued, or necessary to resolve in those cases. The Court's narrow decisions do not create the sweeping defense to removal that the non-citizens here seek. I welcome the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: Well, counsel, previous rulings seem to work against you, so I think it would be good for you to spend a bit of time on that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Certainly, Your Honor. The important thing about those rulings is that they were narrow decisions addressing specific questions. One ruling, for example, was about the interaction between the stop-time rule and notice to appear requirements. The statutory text alone resolved that case. Additional analysis in that opinion was largely dicta.\n\nThe meaning of “change” was not briefed in that case, it was not argued, and the Court did not have before it the wealth of argument and evidence that we have brought to bear in this case, including dictionary definitions and contextual evidence about the meaning of \"change.\"\n\nJudge: I take the point, but it is a very direct statement. The ruling stated that by allowing for a change or postponement to a new time or place, the law presumes that the government has already served a notice to appear that specified a time and place. This wasn’t a ruling reaching beyond the case—it was just the obvious understanding of the statutory scheme. Even if it’s dicta, it reflected what the majority of justices thought was pretty clear.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, if I may address that in two parts. The first statement acknowledges a presumption in the statute that the notice of hearing will follow the notice to appear. We agree with that presumption. But the real question in this case is what happens when that presumption is not met—when the notice to appear did not contain the time and place information.\n\nNow, regarding the statement about the meaning of \"change,\" I acknowledge that this is a difficult statement for my argument, but I do believe it was dicta. It is also incorrect dicta because the Court in that case did not have the evidence that we present now, including dictionary definitions and contextual evidence regarding the meaning of \"change.\"\n\nJudge: Counsel, that seems to beg the question. The finding in that case was that Congress intended notices to be full and complete. Congress knew that the government was issuing notices without specific times and places, and it ruled against that practice. That was the holding. So if you’re arguing that a notice of hearing can stand alone without a proper notice to appear, that runs against the statutory framework.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, in this case, we believe we satisfied that requirement by providing a new time and place. The non-citizens had the information they needed to attend their hearings. Even if one insists that a notice of hearing must change a previously set time or place, that requirement is satisfied here because \"change\" is broadly defined. Moving from an indeterminate time to a determined one is a kind of change.\n\nJudge: So you’re saying no time and place changes to… a new time and place?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Your Honor, what we have done in cases where the original notice lacks a specific time and place is inform the non-citizen that a hearing will occur, and then later provide the specific details. Moving from an unknown to a known time and place constitutes a change within the meaning of the statutory scheme.\n\nJudge: But didn’t you lose that argument in a previous ruling? I thought the Court already rejected that interpretation of the word \"change.\"\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Respectfully, Your Honor, I don’t agree. That ruling only decided whether multiple documents could be combined to create a valid notice to appear. The Court said a notice to appear must be a single document. We do not dispute that point in this case. What’s different here is that Congress created two forms of notice—both of which serve as bases for in absentia removal.\n\nJudge: Can you clarify what you mean by two forms of notice?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Congress established both the notice to appear and the notice of hearing. Both are valid bases for in absentia removal.\n\nJudge: So you believe they operate independently of one another?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They are independent in the sense that each can serve as a valid basis for removal. The notice to appear initiates the proceeding, but a later notice of hearing with a specified time and place is sufficient under the law. The statute is clear on the requirements for a valid notice of hearing—it must set the time and place, and we did that here.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Mr. Richards can come back and he can -- he can come back. He still has to convince a judge that he has exhausted.

Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I agree that there is no right to a jury trial here on exhaustion, and the reason is it didn't exist in 1791. The closest analogs we have are equitable defenses that would have been heard by judges and not by juries.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\r\n\r\nJudge: Counsel, if we limited the rule to your situation, meaning he's not precluded because he can come back because of the law that Justice Alito pointed to, the rape law, I'm not sure that's true because is he alleging rape or is he alleging a First Amendment violation?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, First Amendment retaliation for claims of sexual abuse --\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- are included in it.\r\n\r\nJudge: So that's it. But what happens to the ordinary prisoner? If we announced the rule that you want us to announce, which is exhaustion never goes to a jury, in the mine-run of cases that are not rape-related, prisoners are precluded, practically speaking. We have an amicus brief that says that most exhaustion requirements are -- half of them, half the states, are 15 days or less. And in the others, they are matters of days more than that but no more than 30. Most of the time, when you file a suit as a prisoner, it takes -- the answer takes 30 days. So most cases as a practical matter would be precluded if we adopt your rule that exhaustion under all circumstances is not preclusive.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't agree that in most cases the prisoner would not be able to return. I agree that the time frames for --\r\n\r\nJudge: Why not?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- grievances are very short. Because --\r\n\r\nJudge: So, if they're very short, it seems to me, as a practical matter, I can't see how almost any prisoner could go back.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: You have 31 states, the District of Columbia, and the Bureau -- Federal Bureau of Prisons, all that allow for some level of discretion to excuse untimeliness, and --\r\n\r\nJudge: Wait a minute. That depends on you, meaning the prison. Why would a prison ever do it? Are you aware of any prison that says you failed to exhaust, but now you can come back?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The reason -- I assume that when they put it -- they can -- they don't have to put it in their policy, so if they put it in their policy, I assume that that's important to them, and --\r\n\r\nJudge: This is news to me that there is any state that says if you fail to -- you go to court, they say you failed to exhaust after a factual finding, that we're now going to let you come back to court after you've brought it back to us.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: The 30 --\r\n\r\nJudge: Does your state do that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes. Yes. We have a provision. And there are many states that have provisions --\r\n\r\nJudge: No, no. Point -- I'd like you -- I ask the Court to -- to have you give us examples of that situation occurring.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I -- I can't provide those examples. I don't know --\r\n\r\nJudge: You can't because I haven't found one. The policy is discretionary.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I -- this policy is discretionary. And I -- the reason that a prison system would want to do that is because everything in the PLRA is designed to encourage, to allow the prison system to work out their problems, and they do want to work those out.\r\n\r\nJudge: Counsel, what you are proposing to me is that they have an exhaustion requirement that they're willing to excuse every time a prisoner goes to court, the court says you failed to exhaust, and now the prison's going to say come back and we'll let you exhaust now anyway.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It -- it -- it will depend on the circumstances. There -- there -- and -- and a lot of these policies say there are extenuating circumstances or good cause, just cause --\r\n\r\nJudge: It -- it -- it begs the question -- it begs the question that a judge has found that the prison guard didn't stop you from exhausting and now the state is going to permit you to come back and try again.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think it is in the best interest of the prison systems to try to work out problems. And one of the things that our amicus, multi-state amicus brief, led by Ohio, has pointed out is that under Mr. Richards's rule, if this Court adopts it, there are going to be very few prison systems that want to allow for any excusal of untimeliness. That's going to be a disincentive for them to do that because they've already gone through a jury trial. Now why are they going to excuse untimeliness? But, if they -- a prisoner can go back and, under certain circumstances, they --\r\n\r\nJudge: Huh?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: There -- the discretion --\r\n\r\nJudge: I -- I -- I'm a little lost. They've gone through a jury trial. They won. And the prison is going to listen to the complaint again?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No. If -- if they have a jury trial and they've won --\r\n\r\nJudge: Why would they bother?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It's --\r\n\r\nJudge: Why would the state bother having -- want to?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It's -- it's if --\r\n\r\nJudge: What incentive does it need to?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- there's a dismissal for failure to exhaust without prejudice. The question is whether Richards's rule incentivizes any kind of discretion.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If -- if --", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "447", "dialogue": "Judge: How -- how about this? In my experience, I've seen a lot of cases, and I'll tell you that a hypothetical person with this many kilograms of drugs in its car, caught in this kind of way, in a car with this make and model, who says the following things to the police when she's caught, in my experience, a person like that is always going to have known about the drugs in her car.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, I think that would be objectionable. Of course, that's not the testimony we had in this case, but the D.C. Circuit has a case, which we cite in our brief, addressing that kind of use of mirroring hypotheticals. I think that's just a transparent way to circumvent the rule.\n\nJudge: So then I'm not really understanding. Because if you say, look, you don't have to say Ms. Diaz knows, as long as everybody understands that the description you're giving of the person who knows mirrors who Ms. Diaz is, then you're not willing to be as formalistic as to say she has to be named. You're willing to say the same rule should apply if there's a description that basically matches her. Well, then I don't get why you're not willing to say, if the description is a class in which everybody agrees she's a part and it's 100 percent of the class?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, the way we would articulate the rule is the same way that the Ninth Circuit has articulated, and the Second and D.C. Circuits and other courts of appeals have articulated. And that is, what the expert may not do is testify in such a way that necessarily compels the inference that the defendant had—\n\nJudge: But that's just—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —the requisite mental state.\n\nJudge: It's just a matter of degree as to whether the class is really super narrowly about one person or then gets a little bit broader or then gets a little bit broader, but in all these cases, the person is a member of the class, however exactly you define the class. So, I guess I don't see why at some point you're willing to draw the line.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I'm not sure that's true. There are going to be cases in which there's a factual dispute about whether or not the defendant is in the class. Does the defendant have this mental condition or defect or this other one, or perhaps no mental disease or defect at all? The parties can join issue on whether the defendant is even in the class that the expert is describing.\n\nTo step back here, I also want to stress that the rule is a limited exception to the general rule, which states that, in general, opinion testimony is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue. When Congress enacted this rule, it made a judgment that we're going to, in general, abolish the ultimate issue rule in federal court. These disputes should be channeled through disputes about the reliability of the expert's testimony—whether the expert's testimony is based on sufficient facts and data.\n\nYou can have robust gatekeeping under the court’s case law, which is now reflected in the text of the rule, and this is just a limited prohibition on a specific form of expert opinion testimony in criminal trials. The agent’s testimony looks nothing like the testimony that Congress forbade when it enacted this rule.\n\nJudge: Functionally equivalent. Now, what we're arguing about—because you've just conceded earlier that if you do— We can argue about how wide you define the class, but you could just say anyone who has 55 pounds of drugs in their car, hidden or not, knows the drugs are there, period.\n\nTo me, that's functionally equivalent to saying this defendant had 55 pounds of drugs, so she has to know. And you admitted to another judge that there is a point at which you reach that functional equivalency.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, I really wouldn't describe that as a dispute about how you define the class.\n\nJudge: No, the dispute is about—are you saying it's this defendant?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think in general, the rule here is that the expert may not express an opinion that leaves the jury no room to make the ultimate inference for itself.\n\nAnd if you express an explicit opinion about the defendant's state of mind, that could be sufficient for a violation. All we're saying is we want to leave open the possibility that that might not be necessary for a violation because you're going to have these extreme cases in which an expert carefully avoids stating an express opinion about the defendant in that particular case but nonetheless logically, necessarily compels the inference that the defendant had the requisite mental state.\n\nSo we're talking here about the marginal case.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Anything further, Justice Alito?\n\nJudge\nYeah, one other -- one other question.\n\nI'm intrigued by your Mt. Healthy, Hunter versus Underwood argument.\n\nI mean, maybe you're right, but Mt. Healthy arose in an entirely different context, where you're trying to get to an employer's motivation.\n\nHunter verse -- versus Underwood involved an extreme situation where the Court looked at the records of a state constitutional convention and came to the conclusion apparently that racism was the only motivation for what was done.\n\nBut it does seem to me to be potentially quite unworkable and contrary to what we've generally said about legislative intent to apply the Mt. Healthy framework to a congressional enactment.\n\nDo you -- do you -- do you recognize or do you -- do you acknowledge that that would be very difficult? Because, when an act of Congress is passed, there could be more than 250 different motivations for the votes that were cast by the members.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nMm -hmm.\n\nYeah, I totally understand that.\n\nAnd, in Hunter, the Court actually engaged with that problem to some degree, and what Hunter said is, to avoid that problem, we're going to look just to two things. One is the state's brief, which I would say is the Solicitor General's brief by comparison here, and the text of the law.\n\nAnd, here, that's the only thing I need to rely on to get you to the place that they wouldn't have announced -- wouldn't have enacted this --\n\nJudge\nWell, it gets you to the -- it gets you to the place that this was part of what motivated Congress, but why does it get you home?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nWell --\n\nJudge\nParticularly when there's a severability clause in this Act.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\n--it can't be only part of it.\n\nIt has to be enough to sustain the entire Act or at least the parts that you wouldn't sever from the Act.\n\nAnd so I think the reason why is because it's not just the content recommendation algorithm part that can be theoretically, I guess, severed out.\n\nIt's also the covered company provisions, and it's just the whole approach of the statute that is based on content, not on data security.\n\nJudge\nAll right.\n\nThank you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nSo -- okay.\n\nJudge\nJustice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge\nNo.\n\nI'll save it for the SG.\n\nJudge\nJustice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge\nOne quick question. You -- you repeatedly say that from your perspective, the government's motivation is that the content might be too anti-American or too pro-China, et cetera.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nUh -huh.\n\nJudge\nSo that's why you think this is a content-based restriction. But I guess I'm curious if you would say the same thing if the government had articulated its rationale as saying, you know, our motivation is to limit foreign -- foreign interference --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nJudge\n-- in American social media platforms or discourse.\n\nIsn't that a different motivation --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI wouldn't -- I --\n\nJudge\n-- from the standpoint of how we characterize this?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI agree, but then the question I would ask if the government said that, which I think kind of in the reply brief maybe the government does say that, is that how on earth are you then serving a national security interest? You know, if all you're doing is just saying we don't like a foreign country rearranging cat and dance videos, like, it's hard to come in and make a national security argument.\n\nSo the only way you get to national security, which is the government's own argument, is to look at the substance that's being rearranged and say we don't like the way the substance is going to be rearranged and -- and curated differently.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Chinese government's control of TikTok poses a grave threat to national security.\n\nNo one disputes that the PRC seeks to undermine U.S. interests by amassing vast quantities of sensitive data about Americans and by engaging in covert influence operations, and no one disputes that the PRC pursues those goals by compelling companies like ByteDance to secretly turn over data and carry out PRC directives.\n\nThose realities mean that the Chinese government could weaponize TikTok at any time to harm the United States.\n\nTikTok collects unprecedented amounts of personal data.\n\nAnd, as Justice Sotomayor noted, it's not just about the 170 million American users but also about their non-user contacts, who might not even be engaging with the platform.\n\nThat data would be incredibly valuable to the PRC.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are, and what our vices are.\n\nTikTok's immense data set would give the PRC a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment, and espionage.\n\nOn top of that, the Chinese government's control over TikTok gives it a potent weapon for covert influence operations.\n\nAnd my friends are wrong to suggest that Congress was seeking to suppress specific types of content or specific types of viewpoints.\n\nInstead, the national security harm arises from the very fact of a foreign adversary's capacity to secretly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical goals in whatever form that kind of covert operation might take.\n\nThe Act addresses the threat of foreign adversary control with laser-like focus. It requires only divestiture of TikTok to prevent Chinese government control, and that divestiture remedy follows a long tradition of barring foreign control of U.S. communications channels and other critical infrastructure.\n\nSo, no matter what level of First Amendment scrutiny applies, this Act is valid because it's narrowly tailored to address compelling national security threats.\n\nNow my friend, Mr. Fisher, just emphasized and I acknowledge that millions of Americans enjoy expressing themselves on this platform.\n\nBut the important thing to recognize is that the Act leaves all of that speech unrestricted once TikTok is freed from foreign adversary control.\n\nThe First Amendment does not bar Congress from taking that critical and targeted step to protect our nation's security. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge\nIs there any difference between content manipulation by a non-U.S. company as opposed to a U.S. company?

{"id": "174", "dialogue": "udge: All right. And it expanded liability by substituting the previous terms, which were narrower, specifically referencing only \"any consumer reporting agency or user of information.\" It expanded liability by striking that and putting in the word \"person,\" and \"any person\" is elsewhere defined in the statute to include government.\nSo what is not clear about Congress's intention to expand liability to include government?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we do have this other argument about whether it's clear that Congress actually intended \"person\" to include the government, and I do eventually want to get to that.\nBut I think you're asking me to assume that \"person\" takes the statutory definition in 1681n and o, and why isn't that enough to show that Congress must have intended to waive sovereign immunity.\nMy answer is that it's not unusual for Congress to create a cause of action that applies to a range of defendants, some of whom will still have defenses from other background principles of the law.\n\nNow, in the cases that this Court was referring to in the Financial Oversight and Management Board—\n\nJudge: Counsel, I’m sorry to interrupt, but I just want to understand the nature of your argument in response to my colleagues.\nIt could be one of two things. One, it might be that n and o don’t take the definition, or two, they do take the definition and that’s still insufficient.\nWhich is it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We are making both of those arguments.\n\nJudge: Arguing in the alternative?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, we’re arguing in the alternative. So, even if you accept, as the questions so far have asked me to assume, that \"person\" covers the United States, in that circumstance, you're in exactly the same situation that—\n\nJudge: Let's deal with the first argument, just that they don’t take the definition. I want to understand that because this Court has said that it’s virtually conclusive that the definition applies.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So we accept that ordinarily, statutory definitions make a great deal of difference, but this Court has also—\n\nJudge: More than a great deal of difference. We’ve said they’re virtually conclusive.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. But this Court has also rejected the idea that you always just plug in the terms wherever the defined term appears in the statute. I think the Court's decision in Utility Air is really significant on this, particularly in how the Court structured its reasoning in that decision.\n\nSo Utility Air involved provisions of the Clean Air Act that applied to facilities that emitted any air pollutant. The EPA concluded that those provisions unambiguously applied to facilities that emitted greenhouse gases because the Act-wide definition of \"air pollutant\" included greenhouse gases.\n\nJudge: We’ve read all that. I guess I’m wondering, why isn’t it virtually conclusive here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The reason is that, just as in Utility Air, there were other provisions of the Act that used \"air pollutant\" in a sense narrower than its defined meaning.\n\nJudge: And there may be other provisions in which it's more narrowly applied here, but why does that pertain to n and o?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, if you accept that—\n\nJudge: Let’s get to the statute before us.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In Utility Air—\n\nJudge: May I?\n\nJudge: Please. [Laughter.]\n\nJudge: Utility Air was a very special case in which the Court decided that if you just plugged the definition in, the entire regulatory scheme would collapse.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the first part of the Court's decision—\n\nJudge: All I’m saying is that that’s nowhere near this case. I understand that the government values sovereign immunity and that waivers of sovereign immunity are not all that common. But this is not a Utility Air situation where, essentially, the Court found that applying the definition was inconsistent with the entire statutory scheme.\n\nRecognizing a cause of action here is not inconsistent with the rest of the statutory scheme.\nI’m sorry about that, go ahead.\n\nJudge: Well, no, I appreciate that. And that’s my question too. So, please.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Even the court of appeals recognized that 1681q does not use \"person\" in a sense—\n\nJudge: I understand. We’re talking about n and o here, though, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, if you accept that—\n\nJudge: And let me put it this way. I'm sorry to repeat the question, but this is where I get stuck.\n\nIt doesn’t seem inconceivable—maybe you’ve got an argument—that a rational Congress might, to protect consumers under FCRA, which is all about false reporting of consumer debts and delinquencies, say that the government should turn square corners too, just like private credit reporting agencies.\nAnd that when it falsely reports a consumer’s debt, it should be liable under n and o.\n\nAgain, let’s talk about n and o. Not q. Not Utility Air. Just n and o. You have to argue that it is inconceivable that Congress would have wanted to include the government under these provisions.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Respectfully, I think our task is to show that it’s plausible that that’s not what Congress did here. That’s what the clear statement rule requires.\n\nJudge: That’s the second step. We’re still on the first step. What do n and o mean?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We don’t think that n and o clearly cover the United States. Congress has used the word \"person\" in other parts of the statute in ways that do not include the United States. We think it is therefore plausible that when Congress used \"person\" in n and o, it was using it in a more limited sense.\n\nJudge: What are your best examples of that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We think 1681q. I know I’ve been asked not to talk about that, but—\n\nJudge: You can talk about it with me. [Laughter.]\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We think that 1681q clearly uses \"person\" in a way that does not include the United States. Even the court of appeals recognized that it would not be reasonable to think Congress authorized criminal prosecutions of the United States just through the bare use of the word \"person.\"\n\nJudge: But why is that a definitional change? The text of the statute says that the definitions apply throughout the entire subchapter.\nAnd I understand your point about q, but why isn’t that just a carve-out? Congress is just saying that certain categories of persons can’t face criminal prosecution, but that doesn’t change the overall definition of \"person.\"", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "412", "dialogue": " Judge: And whether or not you have to pay interest on the escrow account does or does not have something to do with the consumer walking in?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Nothing. It's the nature of the product. It's the interest rate on the loan. It's no different than -- there's plenty of state laws that control, you know, things like the term of the loan, what's the maximum amount you can take out on a mortgage loan. Those are all -- those are all preempted, yet states regulate that for state banks. This has been -- I mean, again, we've talked about the OCC. This has been the law since 1983 for all real estate but for things like escrow. The escrow regulation came in in 2004. So national banks but for the Ninth Circuit, which I think covers two state escrow laws, national banks don't comply with state escrow laws unless they want to because it's one of the features they want to do to attract consumers. In terms of how much money, I mean, these are very small dollar amounts. Bank of America put in its brief and it had evidence in the Lusnak, I think it's the Lusnak how I pronounced it, it doesn't earn interest on these accounts and it costs a lot of money to maintain them. So I don't think it's so much that it's -- again, I -- I don't know what the factual showing would be, but I do know the other side would just say New York banks comply with it, so it's -- it's never going to be preempted under these rules.\n\nJudge: I guess I'm just trying to understand the sense of this distinction you're making, and I didn't realize that you were making this distinction, so I'm -- I'm making this up on the fly. But suppose there were a state that said something like before a loan can be denied, a person has a right to see the bank president. And that's very -- it's actually really super inconvenient for the bank. That would fall on your yes, a state can do that side of the line?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it would probably fall on the no, the -- the state can't if you -- it depends on how broad you interpret sort of the services associated with it. I will say that there are state laws that regulate, you know, how the banking statement has to look, what kind of receipts you have to have. If you knew the amount of federal regulations that are just so exhaustive on this that if banks had to comply with 50 different kinds of patchwork of every law on that, but sort of seeing who the bank -- meeting the bank president seems to me similar on, you know, how the bank -- how the banking statement has to look.\n\nJudge: Yeah, it's just suggestive of the -- the idea that it's hard to make this distinction between what concerns your transaction with a customer and what concerns your banking product, which is what I thought you were saying.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it is very easy when you have an interest rate. I think a harder one is like the Anderson versus California.\n\nJudge: Well, so it works for this case, but you're asking us to do something that applies to every kind of case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But it works for every case that's been addressed by OCC's regulation since the 2000s. I mean, this is not -- OCC goes through a laundry list of preempted, types of preempted. They all go to the banking product. They go to the mortgage loan. They --\n\nJudge: Well, the government has disavowed that regulation and said it's inconsistent with the statute. So I don't know how much traction that gets you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think you just heard -- you might as well have heard from the forest service. I mean, they're -- they literally went against the --\n\nJudge: Well, I think we heard from the Solicitor General of the United States on behalf of the federal government.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Contracting two other solicitor generals and saying they didn't even consult with OCC. With all due respect, this is a bank -- this is --\n\nJudge: Where is this line that you've been talking about in your brief? Can you direct me to it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the -- well, the line is --\n\nJudge: I didn't see it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think it's --\n\nJudge: I'm with the other judge.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- I think that's fair on the product, we may have only mentioned the product thing once. The main -- the main test is the control test that the Second Circuit applied.\n\nJudge: Yeah, it's totally different than the control test, isn't it?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, because --\n\nJudge: That's what you're asking us to adopt. And wouldn't, you know, this product versus consumer test itself generate a lot of litigation over border cases?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so. When we tried to talk about the difference with the definition of \"state consumer financial law,\" we talked about -- this is where it gets very close. We talked about there's a difference between controlling the banking power and controlling the financial transaction with the consumer. And I just think the explanation to that just looks to the product.\n\nJudge: It's not in your brief, and it's different -- and if I think it's different from the lower court opinion, what are we supposed to do?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Then stick with our brief. (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Any further questions?\n\nJudge: Well, I share the difficulty that's been expressed in understanding the difference between a state law that affects a national bank's exercise of the banking power and a state law that regulates the way in which the bank exercises that power in dealing with its customers. I mean, maybe -- is there some other way to express this? Is there something else, if we look at the instances that have been held to fall on the latter side of that line, some other characteristic that could be identified that would explain the difference?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, the reason why I like what I'm giving you is because the statute defines \"state consumer financial laws\" in terms of the transaction. So we stuck to the text of \"financial transaction.\" And we think precedent is talking about the national banking power, but because there is this sort of semantic issue, while \"regulate\" is \"regulate,\" are you regulating the power, are you regulating the transaction, it helps to explain what that means. If you wanted the case, it would be Anderson. Anderson talks about it is just a change in the identity of the -- it's no different than if you had like a garnishment or a missing person, but it doesn't affect the underlying function or powers of the bank. And this is a loan. This is literally like the most important thing they do other than take deposits.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "644", "dialogue": "Judge: Mr. Gupta, you may proceed.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Sure.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: The second is I think -- and I --I heard Mr. Katyal say this --that maybe NVIDIA was trying to track crypto sales, but they had inaccurate information or miscalculated.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: But we have specific data from multiple reliable sources within the company showing a consistent pattern. So we have the sales manager in China who reported that 60 to 70 percent of China sales went to miners based on the centralized sales database that Huang reviewed regularly.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And that's confirmed by internal records showing over 800,000 GeForce units sold to miners just in the second quarter of 2017 alone, which is inconsistent with Huang's public statements. We had a witness in Russia who reported that over half of the crypto sales in Russia went to crypto miners and similar reports from other markets, like India.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And these were not rough estimates. They were specific figures for NVIDIA's own tracking systems across multiple markets, which is another way of saying that if you adopted the rule that I urge you not to adopt, we would satisfy it. And then, third, the inference is Huang might not have known what NVIDIA knew.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I think this explanation collapses based on, you know, Huang's own statements about his own knowledge, his direct involvement.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: He reviewed sales data every week, every month, and in quarterly meetings that one witness described as proctology exams because they were so detailed. The nature of his responses, I think, is critical here.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: He, as I said earlier, when he was asked by analysts about the crypto demand, he didn't say, you know, we don't know or I don't know.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: He -- he quantified the statements he was making.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And he didn't express uncertainty.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: He gave very specific figures that, again --\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: -- contradicted the data.\r\n\r\nJudge: Justice Gorsuch?\r\n\r\nJudge: May I -- may I follow up on that, Mr. Gupta?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: So, if we're going to treat this case as error correction, I've got some error correction kind of questions for you.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Sure.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I imagined you might have.\r\n\r\nJudge: The first is your friend on the other side, Mr. Katyal, would say that when it comes to the falsity that you're relying predominantly on two former employees, 1 and 2, and 5's kind of out of the picture after the Ninth Circuit's decision, for example.\r\n\r\nJudge: And 1 is five layers below the CEO and in China.\r\n\r\nJudge: And Number 2 left the company right at the beginning of the class period and, therefore, can't inform what happened thereafter. Would you give me your responses to those?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Sure.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: A --a few things. I mean, first of all, I think the fact that one of them left doesn't change the fact that his testimony, his -- his statements tell us in granular detail how -- what Huang's practices were for tracking this information and specifically crypto sales data.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So the only way in which it would matter that he left would be if you were to draw the inference that suddenly at the moment when the market is most focused on crypto demand and he's being asked about it at every earnings call and in every interview, that he somehow changed his practice and blinded himself to that information.\r\n\r\nJudge: Got that.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So I don't think that really helps.\r\n\r\nJudge: How about 1?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And then, with respect to 1, it is true that he left in December 2017.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: That's into the class period.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And so he was -- I think he was the --\r\n\r\nJudge: The five -- five layers below the CEO, they emphasized.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Well, they say that.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And, you know, that obscures the fact that he was the person in China who had the most knowledge about this issue. He was the person interfacing with the crypto mining enterprises. And we know this because, when headquarters was alarmed about the exploding crypto demand, FE 1 is the person they tasked with looking at all of the data and making this presentation that went to headquarters that showed --\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, he's the guy who -- who knows the data, knows what goes into the sales reports that he sends up the chain.\r\n\r\nJudge: And then you've got the other guy saying and the CEO looked at these sales reports with -- with great interest routinely.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: At least up until the time I left.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Yes, that's right.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay. I got it. On -- on the -- on the second question, on -- on --on the expert report, another fact-bound error correction.\r\n\r\nJudge: Prysm relied on, as -- as we've heard, a proprietary model that was undisclosed.\r\n\r\nJudge: Is that a problem? Why -- why isn't that a problem?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I think that's just an inaccurate characterization of the report, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: This --there was no model.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: This is -- basically, what Prysm was doing was math.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It was taking publicly available figures and doing some multiplication.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And the math, by the way, is the same math that the Royal --\r\n\r\nJudge: Pretty expensive math I have to guess, but -- (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Well, you know, it's the same math that the Royal Bank of Canada did.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And you heard from my friend that there's nothing about the Royal Bank of Canada's calculations.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: So I just do want to point out to the Court that the Royal Bank of Canada's report is in the record.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's at Docket 124-31.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And so you can see that the math there is the same. And this isn't terribly fancy math.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: It's taking what's called the hashrate, which they haven't contested.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: That's the -- the measure of the output on these crypto blockchain networks.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And they -- and --and Prysm did a very conservative estimate.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: They only took the three most popular blockchain networks that required GPU processing, and then they applied a market share number.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: And I think, when he says proprietary model, what he's talking about is one of the three measures of market share that they used, but that was a firm that NVIDIA itself used for market share data.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right, right.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: But they also had two other measures of market share data, and one was based on the internal document that FE 1 prepared, that slide.\r\n\r\nJudge: That 69 percent?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Right.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Exactly.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "82", "dialogue": "Judge:\nSo let me address it with two --two points.\n\nThe first goes to what the motion below actually did, and the second goes to the sequencing Sinochem point that has been raised.\n\nFirst is, what did the motion do? It starts at page 24 of the court of appeals joint appendix.\n\nIt's a motion to reopen and to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nThe only relief it requests is to vacate the arbitral award, and it does not ever request to reopen actually the existing federal claim.\n\nAnd the reason we know that is the only other aspect of relief it requests is to appoint a new arbitrator to adjudicate that claim for relief. So the only thing the motion does is to seek to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nIt's seeking to use Rule 60(b) as the jurisdictional hook to do that, something that the case itself could not do.\n\nSo that's -- that's the first point: What does the motion do? The district court then breaks it apart into two separate orders.\n\nIt says: I'm reopening under 60(1) -- 60(b)(1) and (6).\n\nAnd then it says under the FAA, later, I'm going to vacate the arbitral award.\n\nSo you have -- the only request that's ever been made is to vacate the arbitral award. That's the relief that requires subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe relief that's being requested requires its own form of subject -- its own basis for subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe only basis presented is Rule 60.\n\nThat is not sufficient under Kokkonen.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSecond, the sequencing point.\n\nThe court of appeals refers to this as a jurisdictional issue, but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWe know that because Rule 80 -- under Rule 82, the availability of Rule 60 relief could not expand or contract the district court's statutory jurisdiction.\n\nWhen the court of appeals was referring to subject matter jurisdiction, what it really was referring to was the long history that -- that a court could not -- lacked power to set aside or otherwise interfere with a plaintiff's voluntary dismissal.\n\nIt used a sloppy label in calling it subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nBut the availability of Section 60 relief really is like the question in Steel Company whether a plaintiff's particular claim is available under the statute.\n\nSo we don't think Sinochem's sequencing actually is available here.\n\nIt's more like Steel Company, where the jurisdictional question has to come first.\n\nAnd there's simply no answer to the fact that --\n\nJudge:\nBut I don't --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- the only basis --\n\nJudge:\n-- understand -- I don't understand that at all.\n\nI mean, after --I appreciate that the request seemed to merge the two.\n\nBut, once the district court broke them apart and issued two separate orders and the rest of the way there was a challenge as to whether or not the district court properly granted a motion to reopen, and that was the thing that this Court took cert on, I don't understand why it necessitates us to care about whether the district court was right with respect to its other order.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI -- Justice Jackson, it's because the motion to reopen had sought no relief on a claim.\n\nJudge:\nI understand --I understand what it sought.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that that claim could never have been responded to by the district court until it had the ability to do something.\n\nAnd so, as a threshold matter, the district court said this is a closed case.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nIt --\n\nJudge:\nI would have to reopen it to give you the relief that you seek.\n\nI'm issuing Order Number 1 reopening the case, and then here's Order Number 2 regarding the relief that you seek.\n\nAnd from then on, we all were focused on whether or not the district court made a mistake in determining that this case could even be reopened. And, to the extent that that's the issue, that that's what was presented here, that that' s what the courts have split on, I don't understand why we can't just isolate that as requested and answer it.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI'm not afraid of the question presented, but I -- to -- the -- the jurisdictional point is --is important here.\n\nIf the motion had requested some form of relief related to the case itself, if it had been I want to relitigate my case and vacate the arbitral award, then at least there would be a request for relief that -- over which the district court originally had subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nJudge:\nBut, Mr. McGill, on the first one, as I understand the common law history, courts had -- were considered to have jurisdiction over orders, even final ones, judgments, until the expiration of the term of the court, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nExcept with respect to voluntary non-suits, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nCorrect.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "764", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI think, with respect, Your Honor, it -- it would be a very small step if you wrote your opinion and just affirm the Sixth Circuit on the ground of decision there.\r\n\r\nThe --the only appellate opinion I am aware of that disagrees on the basic intertwinement issue is Judge Posner's opinion in Pavey.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, so, with respect, we -- we don't think it would be a sea change in the law to rule on the -- the narrower question presented here.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nI think one concern is that even if we rule that narrowly, it still has a big effect on PLRA litigation, in other words, that it's easy enough for any prisoner to essentially evade the exhaustion requirement by pleading his claims in the right way and ensuring that the case immediately goes to a jury.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think about that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nI mean, to the extent there --there are concerns about a roadmap, it already exists, right? This trial -- I mean, this case got through Rule 56.\r\n\r\nThere was going to be a trial. So I'm not sure that the incentives are any greater from a -- a roadmap perspective. I mean, also, this Court doesn't usually fashion constitutional rules assuming that litigants are going to perjure themselves or fabricate evidence to get past Rule 56, so I don't think it should do so here.\r\n\r\nAnd the other point I would just make is that this has been the rule in the Second Circuit and the First Circuit more recently for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nThere hasn't been a flood of litigation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the data show that the cases filed and the trials have gone down in those districts.\r\n\r\nI found one case that's actually going to trial in the Southern District of New York on exhaustion, an intertwined case.\r\n\r\nThis --this has not been a --a big problem in the last, you know, 30 years that we've had the PLRA.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nSuppose you have a prisoner who's serving a lengthy prison sentence and files a -- files a grievance, and the State says: Well, you didn't exhaust.\r\n\r\nSo the prisoner says: Well, yeah, I did exhaust.\r\n\r\nI put the -- I put the grievance in the box or I handed it to a guard.\r\n\r\nSo, at a minimum, he gets a -- he gets a trip to the courthouse.\r\n\r\nHe gets a trip out of the prison.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nWell, in our client's case, everything was --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWell, I'm not talking --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\n-- over Zoom, so --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- about your client. I'm talking about -- about other -- other --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nUnderstood.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- prisoners who may want to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI mean, I -- I don't think that's a --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nSo then there's a genuine dispute of --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- material fact about whether he -- you know, is he telling the truth? Is he not telling the truth?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI mean --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nIs he really going to fear that on top of everything else that's happened they're going to bring a perjury prosecution against him?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\r\nI -- I think this is not a new problem, right, and that the rule that the Sixth Circuit adopted isn't really relevant to whether a case is going to pass, you know, screening and -- and all of these other hurdles and get past summary judgment.\r\n\r\nWe're talking about the very few cases that --that get there.\r\n\r\nAnd district courts are well-equipped to decide whether there's a genuine issue of material fact even in prisoner litigation.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nThank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nJustice Thomas, anything further? Anything further? No? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Sherman?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant:\r\nThank you, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nAll claims, including First Amendment claims here, stem from the sexual harassment claim.\r\n\r\nAnd the PREA grievance policy for the MDOC includes First Amendment retaliation. That's in Joint Appendix 72, 73.\r\n\r\nMr. Richards, contrary to my friend's argument, can reargue facts if he exhausts and gets in front of a jury again, and that is crucial here to preserving the Seventh Amendment even if this Court believes that the Seventh Amendment is somehow otherwise implicated.\r\n\r\nAddressing Justice Barrett's questions about discretion, Wetmore does -- the --the key in Wetmore is the discretion that is given to the district court judge.\r\n\r\nHere, that's discretion that, you know, based on historical considerations and based on the --especially the functional considerations here, the fact that there is no precise analog, based on the functional considerations and the goals of the PLRA, that discretion should -- in -- in every case, it would have to -- there would be no discretion, whereas that is what drove the jurisdictional decisions in Wetmore and other cases.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nYou asked about a roadmap.\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy for prisoners to create disputes of fact that turned on credibility, a he said/she said where those cases would have to go to a jury.\r\n\r\nAnd I think, even if there aren't floodgates open now, they will be open under Richards's proposed rule because it is not hard for a prisoner to do that.\r\n\r\nAs this Court said in Woodford versus Ngo, not all -- sometimes prisoners file claims in bad faith, and if they want to make trouble for a corrections officer they don't like or they want to get out of their cell and have a respite -- these are the courts' words, not mine -- they -- they will file in bad faith, and you are incentivizing them to add facts that will get them to a jury.\r\n\r\nOn a final point, it is the nature of exhaustion as a prerequisite that leaves the Seventh Amendment intact here because the Seventh Amendment doesn't guarantee that claims get to a jury, they --it applies once the claims get to a jury.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, once the claims are getting to a jury, because exhaustion has been met, as Congress intended, Mr. Richards and other prisoners will have their day in court.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nThank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nThe case is submitted.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
