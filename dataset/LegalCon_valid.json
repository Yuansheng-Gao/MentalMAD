{"id": "594", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands.\n\nJudge: Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff went to a steakhouse, valeted her car, and when she walked out, she realized her computer was missing. But the defendant says she's such a scammer. She said 35 softball uniforms were stolen, changed to an iPod, and on and on. It's the case of \"I have beef with a valet.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you. Jessica Wolf, you are suing the valet company, represented here by Andres Bazan. Are you the owner, the manager?\n\nDefendant: I'm supervising Westchester County accounts of the company.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you have the authority to represent the company here?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Okay. You're suing for $3,880 in items that you say the company stole from you when they valeted your car. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: I went to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on Saturday, November 26th. Earlier that day, I was at the library studying.\n\nJudge: What library?\n\nPlaintiff: The Orangeburg Library in Rockland County.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I had my laptop, a calculator, and study books and materials in a black tote bag. So I studied, got into the car, put the laptop down. Later that night—\n\nJudge: Where did you put the laptop?\n\nPlaintiff: On the passenger side of the car.\n\nJudge: Where did you put the rest of the stuff you described?\n\nPlaintiff: It was in the bag. Everything was in the bag, and I put it on the passenger seat.\n\nPlaintiff: Later that night, we decided to go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for dinner. We had reservations at around 8:00 or 8:30.\n\nJudge: Who is \"we\"?\n\nPlaintiff: Me and my family.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I picked up my brother. When he got into the car, the bag was on the passenger seat. He moved the bag to the back seat.\n\nJudge: Okay. What about the computer?\n\nPlaintiff: Everything was in the bag. It was a black tote bag; it had everything in it. He moved it to the back seat.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: We got to the restaurant. I was a little hesitant. I saw the valet. I really didn't want to valet my car—not because I thought something would be stolen, but because I was worried about scratches and things like that.\n\nJudge: What kind of car do you drive?\n\nPlaintiff: A BMW 3 Series.\n\nJudge: What year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2011.\n\nJudge: Okay. Continue.\n\nPlaintiff: We pulled up, and I didn’t realize I had the laptop in the back of the car. My brother had just moved it when he got in.\n\nJudge: But your memory didn't last from then?\n\nPlaintiff: I know, but I wasn't thinking about it.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you come up, and what do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: We get to the valet, I hand him the keys, and we go into the restaurant. He hands me the ticket, and we go inside. Everything was fine. When we came back out, I handed the valet my ticket. He ran to get the car. My brother noticed that the car was parked way in the back, in a secluded area near the woods.\n\nJudge: How did he notice that?\n\nPlaintiff: There were no other cars around the vicinity.\n\nJudge: Maybe you stayed late and most cars were gone?\n\nPlaintiff: No, the restaurant was still busy, but our car was parked alone in the last row of the parking lot.\n\nJudge: Did that strike you as strange?\n\nPlaintiff: Not at the moment. But after we discovered what was missing, it made sense.\n\nJudge: So you get the car. Do you look for your stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: No, because it was late, the car interior is black, and the bag is black. It was dark. I didn’t notice anything until the next morning.\n\nJudge: So you took the car home?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. I parked in the driveway. The car automatically locks when you walk away.\n\nJudge: And the next morning?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to the car before church and noticed the bag was missing. I called the restaurant, and they said they’d check with the valet company. Later, my mother suggested I check the whole car. When I opened the trunk, it was wiped clean. I had 35 softball t-shirts in there—they were gone.\n\nJudge: Why did you have 35 softball t-shirts?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m a coach. We had just ordered them.\n\nJudge: Defendant, what happened when the plaintiff contacted you?\n\nDefendant: We got a call from her father, not her. He called at noon the next day. We checked with our two valets—they denied touching anything.\n\nJudge: Do you ever conduct polygraph tests in cases like this?\n\nDefendant: Sometimes, but not in this case. These employees have been with us for years with no complaints.\n\nJudge: Do you have a policy regarding valuables in cars?\n\nDefendant: Yes, the valet ticket clearly states we are not responsible for lost items unless checked with management.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, you left $4,000 worth of items in your car and didn’t check for them until the next day. That makes this case difficult to prove. My verdict is for the defendant.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization,Deflection, dismissal"}

My daughter came to me and said that she had a friend that was looking for a car and asked if I would sell her the Mustang I had.\n\n**[Judge]:** What kind of Mustang did you have?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** A 2006 limited edition Mustang.\n\n**[Judge]:** Okay. Was your Mustang for sale coincidentally, or did she just want it?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** It was going to be for sale in a week or two.\n\n**[Judge]:** Okay. So you show it to her, she likes it, and what happens?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Showed it to her, asked my daughter if she had the money. My daughter said no, but she would pay half down. Talked to Paige. Paige said she’d give me half down and make payments on the rest. I said okay. She got the car, we went to the title place.\n\n**[Judge]:** Why did you sign over the title if she hadn’t paid the rest yet?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Because she signed a promissory note for the balance.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, does she ever pay you anything else?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** No.\n\n**[Judge]:** All right. So why, then, do you buy her tires?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** That was only about a week later.\n\n**[Judge]:** But why would you buy her tires?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Well, eventually when we ordered the tires, she was going to pay for them.\n\n**[Judge]:** How do you order tires without paying for them?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** A friend of mine runs a dealership, and we were getting them through the dealership at a discount. So, I said they’ve already been ordered, and they’re going to take it out of my friend’s paycheck if we don’t get them. I said I’d go ahead and cover them on my credit card for 30 days.\n\n**[Judge]:** And what did she say?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** She said, \"I don’t really want to do that.\" And then she came back with a text and said, \"Let’s go ahead and get the tires. I’ll pay you back for it.\"\n\n**[Judge]:** Do you have the text?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n**[Judge]:** May I see it?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Yes.\n\n**[Judge]:** While he’s looking for that, can I ask you some questions, Paige?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Sure.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, you are a friend of his daughter’s?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n**[Judge]:** Are you still a friend of his daughter’s?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n**[Judge]:** All right. So what happens here? You buy the car, and you’re supposed to pay money, and he says you didn’t. Why not?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Well, after meeting him and giving him the down payment, I got a call from his daughter stating that he liked me, thought I was cute, and wanted to take me out.\n\n**[Judge]:** What’s the age difference between you two?\n\n**[Defendant]:** I don’t know.\n\n**[Judge]:** You never asked?\n\n**[Defendant]:** I don’t know.\n\n**[Judge]:** I’m kind of curious. Anybody else curious? What’s your age?\n\n**[Defendant]:** I’m 28.\n\n**[Judge]:** And how old are you, Mr. Green?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** I’m 57.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, the tires. Wait—you don’t go from \"he likes you, he wants to ask you out\" to \"the tires.\" He likes you, he wants to ask you out—what do you tell his daughter?\n\n**[Defendant]:** I said, \"Sure, absolutely. I’ll go out on some dates with him.\"\n\n**[Judge]:** And then what happened?\n\n**[Defendant]:** During those dates, we were discussing that if things worked out, I wouldn’t have to pay anymore on the car—that those payments would be null and void.\n\n**[Judge]:** Was it your idea or was it his idea?\n\n**[Defendant]:** His idea.\n\n**[Judge]:** That if you dated him, you wouldn’t have to pay it back?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Right.\n\n**[Judge]:** No, if it worked out or if you dated?\n\n**[Defendant]:** If it worked out and we continued dating.\n\n**[Judge]:** And all you had to do was sign your life over? I mean, what does \"it worked\" mean? And what does \"dating\" mean?\n\n**[Defendant]:** I don’t know.\n\n**[Judge]:** It’s your agreement. I’m asking you to specify what you meant.\n\n**[Defendant]:** I mean, we didn’t make a contract on how long or anything like that.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, how many dates did you go on?\n\n**[Defendant]:** We saw each other probably eight times.\n\n**[Judge]:** Were you intimate?\n\n**[Defendant]:** No.\n\n**[Judge]:** Was that part of the deal?\n\n**[Defendant]:** No.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, where would you go when you went out?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Our favorite place was a Japanese restaurant.\n\n**[Judge]:** And after a couple of months, how did it end according to you?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Well, it just didn’t work out. The age difference was an issue.\n\n**[Judge]:** Oh, you woke up one day and realized there was an age difference?\n\n**[Defendant]:** No.\n\n**[Judge]:** So, did you date him so that you wouldn’t have to pay the rest of the money?\n\n**[Defendant]:** Yes. I’m a single mom, and that was an incentive for me.\n\n**[Judge]:** But you weren’t physically intimate?\n\n**[Defendant]:** No.\n\n**[Judge]:** So it wasn’t like money for sex?\n\n**[Defendant]:** No, it was companionship.\n\n**[Judge]:** All right. Mr. Green, your response to this dating claim?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** That’s news to me, ma’am. We never discussed dating. She was a friend. We went out to eat one time.\n\n**[Judge]:** Did you go out to eat eight times?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** One time.\n\n**[Judge]:** One time only?\n\n**[Plaintiff]:** Yes, ma’am. I had a girlfriend at the time.\n\n**[Judge]:** Can you prove that he told you the payments would be waived if you dated him?\n\n**[Defendant]:** It was discussed over dinner. I don’t have proof.\n\n**[Judge]:** You cannot prove it? Then you still owe him the money.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, first I want to say I'm very passionate about my car. My friends and my family call it my mistress.\n\nJudge: Your mistress?\n\nPlaintiff: I've always taken the car—\n\nJudge: You should be washing that thing by hand.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, the reason I take it to this car wash is because they do such a great job, and I’ve recommended them to my friends. This isn’t a touchless car wash. These are actual friction-based car washes.\n\nJudge: Right. Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: On March 15th, I took it to the car wash. I paid to have it done. I turned the car over to them, they took it through the machine, and when it came out, I got in my car and drove home. My antenna is on the right-hand side, so I didn’t notice it until I got home. When I got home, I looked at it, and it’s not just that the antenna was broken—the whole base and everything was pulled right out. I have pictures to show the damage.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I went back to them a couple of days later because I had—\n\nJudge: Why did you go back a couple of days later if you noticed it right away? Because it sounds like you didn’t notice it for a couple of days if you don’t go back until a couple of days later.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I noticed it later that day, but I had to go to work.\n\nJudge: Except that the first evidence that you say something to them is a couple of days later.\n\nPlaintiff: Because I had to work.\n\nJudge: Do you have a phone?\n\nPlaintiff: I called them.\n\nJudge: Do you have any evidence that you called them?\n\nPlaintiff: Only my phone record.\n\nJudge: Can I see your phone record?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have my phone record with me.\n\nJudge: According to you, you don’t hear from him until two days after the car wash?\n\nDefendant: Two days after the car wash.\n\nJudge: That’s critical in this case. That’s a very important aspect of this case.\n\nPlaintiff: I kept getting voicemail.\n\nJudge: So you called them, and there will be evidence of you repeatedly calling them, but you didn’t bring it to court?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: So you go over there a couple of days later, and then what?\n\nPlaintiff: I spoke to the manager, and he told me to fill out a claim. He took pictures of it and said that he would look at the videos to see what happened.\n\nJudge: Did you look at videos?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, we did. We put it into a claim report where the owners also looked at the videos.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: And we saw no negligence. The car was washed the whole time.\n\nJudge: Did you actually have a video of his car going through the car wash?\n\nDefendant: Unfortunately, because of the date, I don’t.

That’s one you should copy and keep. Why wouldn’t you guys do that?\n\nDefendant: I understand, but we were sure what happened. We didn’t mistreat the vehicle.\n\nJudge: You know you’re in a court of law now. You’ve got to make me sure. So, bad idea, right? Next time, you’re going to tape off the tape and make sure you keep the evidence, right?\n\nDefendant: Totally.\n\nJudge: That would be a good idea, right? If you have a tape showing categorically absolutely nothing happened at your car wash, that would be awesome in court, right?\n\nDefendant: I agree.\n\nJudge: What are we going to do with the fact that two days passed?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Ignore it?

Mr. Hernandez, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\nSo, I was looking up on Craigslist for vehicles, for motorhomes, and I came across this one.\n\nJudge:\nAnd why were you looking for motorhomes? You seem very young. How old are you?\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\n28.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you look a lot younger. And you were in the process of moving out on your own and so I wanted to start small.\n\nJudge:\nStarting small is getting an apartment, not owning a motorhome. But go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\nWell, I was going to move it to a lot and then have a space where it's rented out.\n\nJudge:\nSo you see an ad and you like it and you buy it. Do you have the paperwork from the sale of the RV?\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\nHe only gave me a bill of sale. He said on the ad that he had the pink slip and registration.\n\nJudge:\nYou sold him the RV for how much?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\n$2,000.\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\nHe says that it broke down on the way, the first day he had it, and that it died. When I followed him, we put $10 worth of gas in it.\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\n$10? That’s going to take your block. It took him 3 miles and he ran out of gas. I went there the next night. We moved the motorhome over by his mother’s.\n\nJudge:\nHow did you get it there?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nI believe I pushed it with my Land Cruiser.\n\nJudge:\nSeriously?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff (Carlos Hernandez):\nI paid for a tow.\n\nJudge:\nAnd where did you tow it?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nI towed it over onto Vermont and down the street from my mother’s house, just to get it close by and off the freeway.\n\nJudge:\nBut you just dumped it on the road? You just left it there?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nNo, I parked it there.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you parked it in the main street of a business area?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nIt was in a non-residential area, a main street over by a bridge.\n\nJudge:\nDidn’t think any of the business people were going to complain?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nApparently, there was a problem.\n\nJudge:\nHow long was it there?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nI was there for 3 days.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was your plan about where you were going to hide a motorhome until you got your act together?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nWell, it was there for 3 days.\n\nJudge:\nSo now the police come and they knock on your door. What do they say?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nThey asked me if I had identification or a title or anything, and I wasn’t able to show any. I didn’t have the title. I had all this paperwork that he had given me, but it was mostly just maintenance records.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did they arrest you for?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nSuspicion of a stolen vehicle, because it looked like I had stolen it.\n\nJudge:\nHow long were you in jail?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\n3 days.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what happened?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nThey released me.\n\nJudge:\nDid they throw out the case?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did they throw it out?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nA few days after I got arrested.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nThey were able to reach him, and he said, \"Yes, I sold it to him.\"\n\nJudge:\nSo, you get out of jail, did you call him?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes, I called him, and I told him my situation.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did he say?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nHe said, \"Oh, I forgot. You should have reminded me last time. Okay, we’ll do that.\"\n\nJudge:\nAnd what happened then?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nHe had to come to us, and we would take him to the DMV. He had all the paperwork, but the only thing that I had was the certificate of non-operation.\n\nJudge:\nWhat does that mean?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nIt means you cannot operate the vehicle on the road while you have a certificate of non-op.\n\nJudge:\nSo how are you going to get it there?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nOne of the guys who worked for me at my house set up sewage, water, and electricity. I arranged with Carlos to go ahead and have AAA move the motorhome.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happens then?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nIt went into tow. I contacted the towing company, and they wanted to charge us $1,400 to get it out, but we couldn’t get it out unless we had the right paperwork from the DMV.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did the DMV say?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nThey said we would have to pay $22,900 in back fees because we removed it from the premises without filing the non-op.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did Wendy from the tow yard say?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nWendy told me she would let us take it out for $600.\n\nJudge:\nHas it been auctioned?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes, it’s been auctioned off.\n\nJudge:\nDid you know that?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes, they auctioned it off on the 23rd.\n\nJudge:\nBut the people haven’t come to pick it up?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nNo, not yet.\n\nJudge:\nAnd now Wendy said if you come up with $800 by Friday, you can get it back?\n\nDefendant (Thomas Shyer):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, here's what we’re going to do. My ruling is that if you can come up with $800 by close of business on Friday, you can buy the RV back from the storage facility.

Did you guys break up when he went in?\n\nDefendant: No, we broke up the day he went in.\n\nJudge: Okay.

That includes tickets, towing, breakdowns—this is excellent—flat tires, accidents, etc. Just in case something was missed with the etc., I will pay the sum of $60 to $65 each week. That will cover the use of the Honda Civic, not the expenses incurred by the use of the Honda Civic. I will return the Honda Civic with the same amount or more of gas that is already in the tank.\"\n\nJudge: Now, would he pay cash or by check?\n\nPlaintiff: The first time was a money order, then the next time, cash.\n\nJudge: Did you give him receipts?\n\nPlaintiff: He said he didn’t want receipts.\n\nJudge: No, no, no! You always need receipts. Cash should not leave this hand without a receipt coming into this hand.\n\nJudge: So what happens at that point?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him I’d come pick up the car the next day. When I got it, the SRS light was on. He mentioned weeks before that he’d take it to a Honda place to fix it.\n\nJudge: Did you take it to Honda?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you take it to a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. He said repairs were needed, and I want Vincent to pay for them.\n\nJudge: Let me see the receipt. Does it show misuse or regular maintenance?\n\nPlaintiff: Regular maintenance, but—\n\nJudge: So he didn’t do anything wrong, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: I mean, the tires—\n\nJudge: The tires were worn out over time.

The Honorable Judge Marilyn Milian presiding. Litigants have been sworn, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Doug.\n\n**Bailiff:** You're welcome.\n\n---\n\n**[Plaintiff’s Case]**\n\n**Judge:** Okay, Miss Savage, you are suing Miss Garo for $1,000, half of your $22,000 deductible as a result of some tree limbs that fell on your car during a storm. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So on February 25th—\n\n**Judge:** Of what year?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Of this year.\n\n**Judge:** Of 2022?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, 2022. Around 9:00 a.m., I was asleep and got woken up. It sounded like gunshots, but when I looked out the window, it was branches falling on top of my car. It was a rainy, freezing morning. The trees were frozen, and the branches fell on my car.\n\nI immediately ran outside, and the cops were already there. But I couldn’t file a report because they said it wasn’t a car accident.\n\n**Judge:** So there was no police report?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I couldn't do it. They said they don't do that.\n\n**Judge:** Did you take pictures that day?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I did.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have pictures of the damaged car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** Were these pictures taken when the storm happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**Judge:** Let’s see them.\n\n**[Plaintiff presents pictures of the damaged car]**\n\n**Plaintiff:** These show the damages to my car. And I don't have an American car; I have a German car.\n\n**Judge:** Your point being?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That the repair is expensive.\n\n**Judge:** What year is your car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It’s a 2017.\n\n**Judge:** And the repair cost was $6,000?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, that’s what my insurance company informed me.\n\n**Judge:** But you didn’t do the repair, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, my insurance company did, and they paid $6,000.\n\n**Judge:** What needed to be repaired?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have everything that shows the repair details.\n\n**Judge:** Let’s look at the repair bill. Now, this tree we’re looking at—there’s frozen ice on it, and that’s what caused the branches to fall, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, but I initially thought it was a dead tree.\n\n**Judge:** Cutting into a tree doesn’t kill it. Were there leaves on the tree in the prior November?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** So how long had that tree not had leaves?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Probably a year before.\n\n**Judge:** So the tree had been dying since you moved there?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And the tree is right on the property line, correct?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, that’s correct.\n\n**Judge:** And you confirmed that with a land survey?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I did a land survey after she mentioned it.\n\n**Judge:** So once you found out, you asked her to split the cost because the tree was dead?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n---\n\n**[Defendant’s Response]**\n\n**Judge:** Miss Garo, what is your response?\n\n**Defendant:** The plaintiff came to me five months after the storm, trying to extort three grand for some so-called damage to her car. She’s just trying to get money. The tree branches didn’t even touch her car. She never mentioned anything until five months later, and I refuse to be ripped off.\n\n**Judge:** The plaintiff says the tree branch came down on her car during a storm, and you own half the tree. So she believes you owe her half the cost of the repair.\n\n**Defendant:** The branches fell, but there was no damage to her car.\n\n**Judge:** But there is damage to the car. Do you have security camera footage?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, but my camera is far away.\n\n**Judge:** This picture shows damage. Don't you think?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, Your Honor, but the damage could be from before.\n\n**Judge:** The police were there, but it’s not a criminal matter. You see there’s damage, right?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, but how do I know the accident wasn’t from before?\n\n**Judge:** Do you have evidence that the damage was pre-existing?\n\n**Defendant:** No, but I don’t believe I should have to pay.\n\n---\n\n**[Judge’s Verdict]**\n\n**Judge:** Trees falling in a storm are considered an act of God unless it’s a dead tree. If it’s dead, it becomes a homeowner’s responsibility. Miss Garo, did you ever contact the city about the tree?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, multiple times. But the city only takes care of branches touching power lines.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have proof of these calls?\n\n**Defendant:** Only text messages.\n\n**Judge:** And your boyfriend didn’t know it was his tree?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, not until later.\n\n**Judge:** The tree is clearly shared property. The issue is whether you, Miss Garo, were responsible. You live in a town where you could hire someone to cut the tree. I understand you thought the city should handle it, but the fact remains—it was a dangerous tree.\n\nBecause it was a known risk and a shared tree, I find you half responsible for the deductible. I rule in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of **$1,000.**\n\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "deflection, minimization, deflection"}
{"id": "1004", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you. Douglas, Ann Tongsil, you are suing Charles Arens?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: For $475, the amount of your security deposit. He’s your former landlord, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So you no longer live in that building, but while you were living there, the building transferred ownership. Is that right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I still live in the building.\n\nJudge: Oh, you do still live in the building.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: And basically, I rented out the apartment from him. He leased it out to me in March.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And probably like a month in, I get a letter on my door from a new owner saying he owns the building now.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And he's asking for first month's rent, first month's security. So I'm thrown off ‘cause I'm like, \"What's going on?\"\n\nJudge: So you had to come up with three months again?\n\nPlaintiff: Pretty much, yeah.\n\nJudge: But how much had you paid him for rent?\n\nPlaintiff: For him, it was $475.\n\nJudge: No, but how had you paid him? First, last, and security a month earlier?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I did. I paid him first month’s rent and security.\n\nJudge: Okay, so the first month’s rent, you had lived there. Then he has your security. And then the new owner is asking for the next month’s first month’s rent for him, last month, and a security.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you tell him, “Why didn’t you get it from the old owner?”\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I’m basically asking him questions like, \"How does this work?\" Because now I have to sign a new lease with—\n\nJudge: How did you sell the building? Or did you get foreclosed on?\n\nDefendant: Foreclosed.\n\nJudge: Oh. So somebody bought it, I guess at auction, in the foreclosure?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. Now, you say something in an answer to the complaint that you owned—did you own two buildings that were adjacent?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. And is this the only one that got foreclosed on?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. So your new landlord made you pay last month and another security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you agreed to it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you have a lease with him, or no?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Listen, the new owner takes it subject to whatever rights and obligations are already there. You could have forced him to just accept what was going on. You had a lease?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the lease was for you to pay how much to Charles?\n\nPlaintiff: $475 for rent.\n\nJudge: And then the new person comes in and says, \"I’m not going to respect that lease\"?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Yeah, no. He would have had to. That’s horrifying. And now you gotta pay how much in rent?\n\nPlaintiff: $550.\n\nJudge: That stinks. Did you sign a new lease with him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Yeah. So now it's not even like you can do anything about it. You didn't have to sign a new lease. He would have had to just eat it for the rest of the term. But we're not here to talk about that. Bygones are bygones.\n\nSo, you do pay him a new security, and then you tell him, “Hey, I need my security back from you.” And what’s he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He told us—well, me and the other tenants there—that he was going to give us the security back. And then he even wrote us a letter saying that he would return our security back.\n\nJudge: Would or wouldn’t?\n\nPlaintiff: He would.\n\nJudge: And then you never even got it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ever call him? Or did he stop taking your calls? Or how’d that work out?\n\nPlaintiff: I called him, and he said he would give it back to me on this type of week, on this day. Never got it back. So at this point, I’m like, \"Am I getting my money back?\"\n\nDefendant: As part of our leasing, the lease I asked for was $550. I learned of the foreclosure, and it became apparent it was going to happen.\n\nJudge: How long had you not been paying the mortgage? Because foreclosures don’t happen in 20 minutes.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: How long had you not been paying the mortgage?\n\nDefendant: Approximately a year.\n\nJudge: A year. So it wasn’t like you read the tea leaves. You had not been paying it for a year, so of course, it’s inevitable.\n\n(…)\n\nJudge: All right. Yeah. No, I'm ordering you to return to her everything but $25 of her security deposit. And you will be returning to her $450. That’s just wrong for you to keep that.\n\nThat’s my verdict.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "evasion, minimization"}
{"id": "553", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff parked his car at the defendant's parking lot at the airport, and when he returned, there was damage, and the defendant won’t own up. But the defendant says the plaintiff submitted a grossly inflated bill, and he has real questions about whether the damage even happened at his lot. It’s the case of \"The White Zone is Pursuing Only.\" Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Thomas Maretta?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing the parking facility where you frequently park your car, represented here by the owner. You’ve asked us not to use your last name, so I’m going to call you Rick. You are suing for $1,192, the estimate for a repair that you are going to have to undergo because, according to you, it was damaged in their lot.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: What’s happening?\n\nPlaintiff: I parked the vehicle there last Christmas. I took a trip to visit my family. I had the vehicle parked there for nine days. Due to overcrowding, they requested that we valet park our vehicles, so I left the keys in their possession the entire time. When I came back, I did a walk-around of the vehicle and noticed right away that there was significant damage on the back quarter panel. I reported it to the shuttle attendant right on the spot, took a picture with him standing there, and then reported it to the gate attendant as well. They advised that the manager was not on duty because it was New Year's. The next day, I contacted the manager.\n\nJudge: And are you also the manager?\n\nDefendant: I am.\n\nPlaintiff: I advised him that I was at the Mercedes-Benz dealership to get an estimate for the repairs. I sent him the photographs.\n\nJudge: And then what did he say to you?\n\nPlaintiff: He said to send him the estimate.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I went to the body shop, got the estimate, and then emailed it to him. At that point, he said the damage looked like something that could not have been done in his lot.\n\nJudge: How does damage look like something that can’t be done?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Do you have photos?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Are these the pictures that you took that day?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t have the original one because it was on a cell phone.\n\nJudge: What kind of car is this?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s a Mercedes-Benz GLK 350, 2010 model.\n\nJudge: You can see that the scratches go in almost a diagonal line. Come here. Your car is the cleanest, shiniest car in the world. It just reflects like a mirror. What part of the car is this?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s the rear quarter panel. That’s the back tire on the driver’s side.\n\nJudge: Alright, go ahead and go back. So, he says to you it looks like damage. He needs better pictures. You take the better pictures and send them to him. Then what does he say? When does he decide he’s not going to pay?\n\nPlaintiff: He said at that point that the insurance company may need to get involved because of the amount of the damage. And that was the last I ever heard from him.\n\nJudge: Did you stop contacting him?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I sent letters to him, called him, emailed him, and sent letters through my attorney twice. Did not hear from him. Contacted the Better Business Bureau.\n\nJudge: Tell me what your defense is.\n\nDefendant: The plaintiff and I had a minor conflict about six months prior regarding some sales tax. The plaintiff parked his vehicle for roughly the same amount of time. At the window checking out, he handed me two credit cards. I happened to be the cashier that day. He asked me to split the ticket because part of his trip was business and part was personal. We got into a small discussion about sales tax—$2.70. He said he didn’t have to pay it because the business was government-related.\n\nJudge: What does that have to do with this case?\n\nDefendant: It just shows that there was some prior dispute.\n\nJudge: If someone spots damage before they leave the lot, is the lot responsible?\n\nDefendant: It depends, but not usually. On the back of the ticket, it specifically mentions a limitation of liability.\n\nJudge: But if they are negligent and they damage a car, are they responsible?\n\nDefendant: 100% responsible.\n\nJudge: When a customer notices damage before leaving, your only defense is that it was there before. What evidence do you have?\n\nDefendant: The location and nature of the damage is not consistent with something we could have done.\n\nJudge: Did you look at the video footage?\n\nDefendant: No, it was not recorded.\n\nJudge: Then you’re going to lose the case. The plaintiff noticed the damage while still in your custody. You have no proof it was pre-existing.

{"id": "76", "dialogue": "PLAINTIFF (Connie Collins): This is the plaintiff, Connie Collins. She says she's an animal lover who currently has 14 dogs, three horses, and a cat. She used to have a beautiful pony named Ginger—until the defendant's vicious dog got loose once again and attacked Ginger, ripping her face off and brutally killing her.\n\nGinger was a member of her family. Another one of her horses had to be put down because it had a nervous breakdown over the loss of Ginger. She’s suing for the state maximum of $10,000 for all she’s lost.\n\nDEFENDANT (Joseph Solario): This is the defendant, Joseph Solario. He says he knows the plaintiff thinks his dog killed her pony, but he didn’t. Another type of animal did.\n\nHis dog and the plaintiff’s dog were friends, and his dog often dug under the fence to go play. It was never an issue until her pony was killed. The cops exonerated his dog because the bite marks didn’t match up. It was determined another animal did it, and he’s sorry for her loss, but he’s not responsible.\n\nHe’s accused of a big pony problem.\n\nBAILIFF: All parties, please raise your right hand. You may be seated.\n\nJUDGE: Thank you. Miss Collins, you are suing your neighbor, Mr. Solario, for $10,000 that you say you are out as a result of his dog getting loose and attacking and killing your pony.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Three dogs.\n\nJUDGE: Three dogs? Tell me what happened.\n\nPLAINTIFF: The original two dogs—one was a puppy and the other was an older dog. They dug under half a dozen times. They weren’t a huge threat, but I did tell him, “Look, you can't have these dogs over here, because there’s going to be an accident.”\n\nI have small dogs, and sometimes they go down with me to feed the horses. I would push his dogs back under the fence, fill up the hole, and then call him to tell him, “Hey, you need to keep these dogs over there.”\n\nBut those were the only two that had come over—the older dog and the puppy.\n\nJUDGE: And what did he say?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He said, “Okay, I’ll take care of it. I’ll do something.” Then the dogs disappeared. So I assumed he took them somewhere else to live.\n\nJUDGE: Does he live there?\n\nPLAINTIFF: He lives next door.\n\nJUDGE: Does he actually live there, or is it just a second property?\n\nDEFENDANT: That’s where I live, Your Honor. But I don’t understand how she knows that I’m not there. Was she spying on me or something?\n\nJUDGE: I guess she’s looking for you to talk to you about your dogs getting onto her property. Had she told you before that your dogs were getting over there?\n\nDEFENDANT: She did approach me once, but I found out why my dogs were going over there—it was because she was feeding them. She was actually leaving a bucket with water there.\n\nJUDGE: Why would you think that was for your dogs that are fenced in on your property?\n\nDEFENDANT: Because it was on my side of my property. She tied a bucket to the fence and threw it over onto my property.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Because he’s never there, and the dogs were thirsty. It was 100-degree heat, and they were panting. So I lowered a bucket on the other side and filled it with water.\n\nJUDGE: Okay.\n\nPLAINTIFF: We love animals. I felt bad—he’s never there.\n\nJUDGE: So then what happens?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Well, when I told him, he said, “Okay, I’ll take care of it.” I told him to please make sure they don’t come back over.\n\nJUDGE: I mean, if she’s putting a bucket of water there on your side because she sees the dogs panting, that’s a far cry from inviting them onto her property. Either way, a fence solves the problem. What measures did you take to make sure your dogs didn’t get over there?\n\nDEFENDANT: I left them in the immediate backyard. I have an extended backyard, which is about an acre, but I kept them in the immediate backyard to keep them away from where they had been digging.\n\nJUDGE: But then on the day in question, had you let them go into the big yard?\n\nDEFENDANT: I did let them go out to the big yard because there was no concern anymore—the bucket had disappeared.\n\nJUDGE: What was the integrity of the fence like? At some point, you put chicken wire there?\n\nDEFENDANT: I did. I also put some wooden pallets across the fence.\n\nJUDGE: And according to you, none of that worked. Because one day, you walk outside, and what do you see?\n\nPLAINTIFF: I walk through the gates, and there are these three big dogs charging at me, covered in blood. I couldn’t find Kayla—\n\nJUDGE: Who’s Kayla?\n\nPLAINTIFF: That’s the husky that lives with the horses. I thought, “Oh my God, they killed Kayla.” But when I went to the back of the property, Kayla was in the corner.\n\nIn the other corner was my pony—with his face ripped off. Muzzle and everything.\n\nJUDGE: Oh my God.\n\nPLAINTIFF: Kayla had punctures in her neck, but nothing that needed stitches. She was going to be okay. But the pony was gone.\n\nJUDGE: How old was the pony?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Twenty-six.\n\nJUDGE: What is the life expectancy of a pony?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Forty.\n\nJUDGE: You originally sued for the value of the pony and set it at $3,000. Now you’re asking for $6,000. Why?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Because I can never replace the pony for that amount. It takes years of training to prepare ponies for events. I can’t replace him for that price.\n\nJUDGE: You need to prove that to me. How did you determine the pony’s value?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Horse Trader magazine, and other places that sell ponies.\n\nJUDGE: Do you have that with you?\n\nPLAINTIFF: No.\n\nJUDGE: You can’t just say a number in court. What breed was the pony?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Welsh.\n\nJUDGE: Did you contact him when you saw the pony was gone?\n\nPLAINTIFF: Yes, I called him right away. I told him the dogs were covered in blood and the pony was dead.\n\nDEFENDANT: Animal Control contacted me on May 12, 2018. I wasn’t home—I had just gotten a promotion and was living at a Humboldt County station as an assistant fire engine operator.\n\nJUDGE: So you weren’t living at that place?\n\nDEFENDANT: It’s still my primary residence, but my job requires me to be gone sometimes.\n\nJUDGE: Who takes care of the dogs when you’re gone?\n\nDEFENDANT: My brother. He lives there too.\n\nJUDGE: Did she call you?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes. She also admitted she had been feeding my dogs.\n\nJUDGE: But she had already told you before to keep your dogs contained.\n\nPLAINTIFF: I only gave them water and threw them a few biscuits.\n\nJUDGE: That’s not the best idea if you don’t want them burrowing. But you, Mr. Solario, are still responsible for keeping your dogs on your property.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, playing the victim, emotional appeal, deflection, exxageration"}

What percentage are you asking for?\n\nPlaintiff: I calculated percentages based on lack of full use and enjoyment of my apartment.\n\nJudge: The main issue you’ve shown is the hallway leak. The mice infestation has been ongoing for 12 years, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: When you complained, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: The landlord would call an exterminator, but the mice would return in winter and rainy seasons.\n\nJudge: So you want rent rebated because the place was unlivable, but you stayed for 12 years.\n\nPlaintiff: I’m a senior citizen on a fixed income.

I was raising it to $900.\n\nJudge: What was his reaction?\n\nDefendant: He said seniors couldn’t afford rent increases.\n\nJudge: Mr. Lynch, you claimed the lease automatically renewed. Where did you get that idea?\n\nPlaintiff: A tenant’s union representative told me.\n\nJudge: That’s incorrect. When a lease ends, it becomes a month-to-month tenancy. She can raise the rent or evict you. You didn’t pay February or March, so she has grounds to evict.\n\nDefendant: I issued a three-day pay-or-quit notice but haven’t filed eviction yet.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nDefendant: My realtor said it’s easier to sell the building with tenants.\n\nJudge: That’s terrible advice. It’s harder to sell with a non-paying tenant. Get a new realtor.\n\nPlaintiff: I reported the building for code violations, and it was cited for four violations.\n\nJudge: So you’re actively making it harder for her to keep you there. Do you see the problem?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: Also, I was supposed to get my security deposit back after a year.\n\nJudge: That’s false.\n\nPlaintiff: I have letters where I complained about conditions.\n\nJudge: The more you complain, the more likely you’ll be evicted. That’s how this works. Ms. Robinson, did you move here from California?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I lived there for 40 years but moved back to care for my sister.\n\nJudge: And your sister and Mr. Lynch didn’t get along?\n\nDefendant: No, they hated each other.\n\nJudge: Then why are you being generous to him? He’s not paying rent.\n\nDefendant: I didn’t want to put him out on the street.\n\nJudge: He’s trying to put YOU out! You need to file the eviction.\n\nPlaintiff: I’ve been faithfully paying rent for 12 years.\n\nJudge: Who are you paying February and March’s rent to?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s in the bank.\n\nJudge: So you have the money?

{"id": "184", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff wants the defendant to pay up on a loan, and he doesn’t care that they’ve known each other for 29 years. But the defendant says he doesn’t owe the plaintiff anything; he’s making it up. It’s the case of should old acquaintance be forgot. Shannon Grant?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. You are suing Richard Green for $1,325 that you want paid to you for parking tickets, impound fees, transportation, and lost wages as a result of tickets that the defendant got on a car of yours—a car of his that you put in your name?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why did you do that?\n\nPlaintiff: When you know somebody for over half your life, you grew up with them, you know their mother, father, and of course, when people just get married and have kids and they ask for your help because of family problems—you know, I was going through family problems at the same time and I was living on my own—so when he came to me reaching out, I felt deep inside like, you know what, if my mother wasn’t there to help me and I’m busting my behind working like he was at the time, I’d want a friend to do that for me.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but why did he need you to do that for him?\n\nPlaintiff: He had an accident with his brother’s van, and it wasn’t his fault, he said, or something like that. And there was a conflict within the family business that he worked in with them helping him get a car on the road.\n\nJudge: Why does somebody have to help him get a car? He’s a grown man. First things first, just give me the answer. I know the answer is going to be because he has bad credit, right?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s basically the answer.\n\nJudge: Okay. How do you get bad credit?\n\nPlaintiff: Basically, not paying your bills.\n\nJudge: That’s enough to not want to put a car in your name that he’s driving because if he gets tickets, he’s not going to pay them. Right?\n\nPlaintiff: You’re right.\n\nJudge: All right, so you decide to put a car he’s driving in your name, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: It was supposed to be for a short period of time until he could just get on his feet, about three months. And four months, really, it was a six-month ordeal with the insurance. Long story short, within a two-month period, I couldn’t find Rich.\n\nJudge: You couldn’t find him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: What are you talking about? This guy is like your blood brother, your best friend. How do you not find him?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m trying to avoid it, but, uh, it’s drugs.\n\nJudge: Whose drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: It was because of drug use I couldn’t find him.\n\nJudge: Whose drug use?\n\nPlaintiff: His.\n\nJudge: So now you can’t find him. Did you know that he had a drug problem?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Well, apparently, you didn’t know him very well to be putting the car in your name. So he’s run off, and what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: I go by—\n\nJudge: Why are you looking for him anyway? Because of three tickets?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s right. So I already got notice of the three tickets. I would have never even—I would have gotten into the situation that you originally said, where he would have probably crashed some kids and I would have gotten in trouble. But basically—\n\nJudge: What do you mean “found out about the car”?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I don’t know what happened to this car. It mysteriously just disappeared.\n\nJudge: So the first sign you have that something is wrong is that you get a ticket in your name?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And when those tickets came in your name, you tried to reach out to him?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. And I was like, “Yo, what’s going on?”\n\nJudge: What ended up happening?\n\nPlaintiff: His mother and his brother, who is a police officer, were looking at me suspiciously for my name being on a car that was his. His mother made me feel like I did something funny with this guy, so I gave his mother and his brother the title without getting it signed because I wanted the tickets to be paid. And then, I never heard anything again.\n\nJudge: So now you hand over the title. And then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: Honestly, I didn’t hear anything. I thought it was handled because I never got any more paperwork.\n\nJudge: And now you’re in court. All right, let’s hear from the defendant. What happened?\n\nDefendant: Look, we’ve been friends for a long time, just like he said. There is no situation where I put a car in his name. I don’t even own a Honda. If I did, it would have been a Honda Civic or something. I drive a different car now.\n\nJudge: Did you ever talk to him about the tickets?\n\nDefendant: He never called me about any tickets. The first I heard about this was Monday when he called me saying he had tickets in my name. I told him, “Bring it by my house, let me see it.”\n\nJudge: Why would you ask to see the tickets if you never had a car in his name?\n\nDefendant: I don’t know. I just wanted to see what he was talking about.\n\nJudge: All right. I have enough here.

What happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** In November of 2017, I bought a car. I put $3,000 down on a 2009 Smart Car.\n\n**Judge:** A Smart Car is those tiny little things?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have the paperwork from the sale?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I do.\n\n**Judge:** May I see it? Go ahead. She’ll get it. Go ahead.\n\n**Plaintiff:** The first day I drove off the lot with the car, the engine backfired.\n\n**Judge:** Did you have a warranty on the car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** And was the warranty through a third party?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It should be right on your paperwork. Here’s the warranty right here.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, so you do have it. And is it by a third party? Like, in other words, does it have a phone number for you to call, instructions?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so something goes wrong, and what do you do with the car? Well, what is it that went wrong?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, the engine backfired. And I called Eric because I wasn’t certain what to do.\n\n**Judge:** Eric is the representative at JTL Auto who sold you the car?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. I called him and said, \"You know, the car backfired, a loud gunshot noise came out the back.\"\n\n**Judge:** And what did he say?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He reassured me that it was fine. I said, \"I thought you looked at the car?\" He said, \"Well, I personally didn't look at the car, but somebody else did.\" I asked, \"Do I bring it back to you or someone else?\" At the time, I didn’t know what to do.\n\n**Judge:** What did you actually do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** As a matter of fact, I didn’t do anything at that time. He reassured me over the phone.\n\n**Judge:** So you kept driving it. And what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A lot of the signals in the car kept coming on.\n\n**Judge:** When did that happen?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Just a few days after getting the car, maybe four days after.\n\n**Judge:** And what did you do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I called him again.\n\n**Judge:** So you called him again, and then what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He just reassured me that it could be something electrical.\n\n**Judge:** When do you finally have the car seen, and who do you have it seen by?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I had it seen by Eric maybe two weeks after November, maybe the end of November.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so it’s still in November. Do you have any records of a visit in November or early December?\n\n**Defendant:** I have no record of a visit. I have a record of a phone call at the end of November.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah, she called and said that she was losing air out of her tire. That was it. There was no mention of anything else.\n\n**Judge:** Did she ever talk to you about the other problems she’s testifying to here?\n\n**Defendant:** No.\n\n(Conversation continues in the same detailed fashion, with the plaintiff detailing issues with the car, the judge questioning why she did not act on her warranty, the defendant insisting the issues were minor, and the judge ultimately ruling that the plaintiff mishandled the situation by failing to sign a deferment agreement and abandoning the car.)\n\n**Judge:** Here's what’s going on. You do not get $5,000 for a defective car. You bought a used car, and what you have a right to claim is one of two things: things you can prove were wrong with the car at the time of sale that they hid from you—we do not have that going on here—or things that go wrong after you purchase the car, and that would be what’s in your warranty. Warranties usually do have exclusions, so if it turns out that your warranty had exclusions in this regard, that is on you. That’s the warranty you bought.\n\n**Judge:** On your claim against them—zero.

You’ve asked us not to mention the name of the leasing company. What’s your position with the company?\n\nDefendant: Leasing specialist.\n\nJudge: Okay. You are suing for $1,800, the return of your security deposit. And Miss Pacus, you say that she’s not entitled to it because she damaged the place, correct?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: All right. How long were you living there?\n\nPlaintiff: Two years.\n\nJudge: Two years?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And this is for a house?\n\nPlaintiff: House.\n\nJudge: Okay. Now according to you, she left the place in a condition that would not entitle her to the return of the deposit. Did you personally see it?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t personally walk the premises, but we take extensive photographs and keep extensive records. So I reviewed her move-in pictures, I compared them with her move-out pictures, the bid from the contractor, and after I did an analysis, that’s how we came up with the determination.\n\nJudge: Okay. Would—can I present the two pages of the lease that I’d like you to see? Where they’re required to maintain the outside of the premises? They’re required to keep the exterior pressure washed and also keep the interior clean?\n\nJudge: They’re required to pressure wash?\n\nDefendant: They are required to maintain the grounds outside, the pavement—\n\nJudge: Just a second.

That’s her front porch.\n\nJudge: So what is that?\n\nDefendant: That’s a sidewalk that runs in front of her front door.\n\nJudge: Okay.

Or at least bleach it down, not give it to you like that?\n\nDefendant: That’s an excessive amount of dirt.\n\nJudge: Where would the dirt come from? That comes from rain and that stuff, right?\n\nDefendant: I mean, she’s required to maintain the property, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Then these are the walls.

{"id": "79", "dialogue": "Judge:\nAlrighty. Anita, today, yes, you are suing your neighbor, Elora Wilson, for $2,500 for false arrest and pain and suffering. Well, it must be very interesting to live in your neighborhood these days. How long have you lived there?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nFor almost 2 years now.\n\nJudge:\nHow long have you lived there?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nLike three.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you two used to be friends?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nYes, friends and neighbors. We used to hang out with each other, have barbecues at each other's houses.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you borrowed a vacuum?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, and you never returned it.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nNo, that's not true. What happened? We were friends, and she was lending me her vacuum from time to time, and that's how we became friends.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, I know. I want to know what happened because she asks for it rudely every time she's coming to retrieve it.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nReally, it's hers.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nWhy weren't you returning it?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI mean, we were cool, so it was never that. I had a bunch of kids in the car because it was my son's birthday weekend, so when I dropped them off, I called her and I said, “D, it's best that I don't borrow your vacuum anymore because I don't like how you come and retrieve it.” She was like, “Well,” and then she said something else smart, and I said, “Because I don't have time for your crack attitude.” She was like, “Wow.” And so we left it as that.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nSo it wasn’t about the vacuum?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nIt was about her attitude.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nMy kids were outside, and I had left with my boyfriend and we went somewhere else because the power was out, but the kids were still there with my mom playing in the driveway.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nMy neighbor and my sister heard her say she was going to run the kids over about the kids playing in the driveway.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, whose driveway is it?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nIt’s a shared driveway. It’s nobody’s.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYou have a picture of the driveway?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI do.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, can I have it?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nYes, indeed, I got it.\n\nJudge:\nSo this is on the side of each of your houses or no?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNo, as you see the long way coming up, when you drive all the way up, you’re driving to my house.\n\nJudge:\nWhat, you pass her house to drive to your house?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, you have to go drive.\n\nJudge:\nSo it’s an actual easement on the side of the houses where both of you can drive on it and then you park the cars off of the easement?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes. Her park is to the side.\n\nJudge:\nSo what happens when you come home and she gets off from work the next day?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI’m waiting outside, and when she pulls up, I said, “So you're running over kids in the driveway?” She was getting out of the car with her coworker, and so she starts saying what she starts... words were exchanged back and forth. She kicks the side of the car. As I'm trying to move the car, when she kicked the car, that’s why I was like, \"I'm not changing my mind about going anywhere.\" She then hopped in the car with her friend and they pulled off and left.\n\nJudge:\nSo she kicks your car, you call the police?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI didn’t call the police. I just pulled my car up to where I did.\n\nJudge:\nDid she damage your car?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nNo, she didn’t damage it.\n\nJudge:\nOne moment, pin it right there and I’ll be right back with you. What had happened? Had you ever said, “I’m going to run over your kids?”\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI did not say that. What had happened, there was nothing about the kids that night. I don’t know what she’s talking about. Okay, that night I came home from work. What?\n\nJudge:\nEarlier that day, had you been around?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nHow about the day before? Did you have a fight with her sister or her mother or her daughter or something?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nThat was after she hit me with the car.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, that was the next...\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nSo now let’s talk about the day that you say she hit you with the car and you two get into a fight. Who’s saying what?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nShe’s calling me a crackhead. My boyfriend is a hophead. I ain’t never got no money, I’m going out buying dope, all this stuff. She’s hollering at the top of her lungs, drunk in her bra and underwear, and I’m looking. She looks at me and goes, “What?” And I’m like, “You nasty.” And I walk in the house and I close the door. I hear all kinds of noise and shouting and screaming and everything, and then the garbage can hits the side of my house, so I call the cops. The cops that I called didn’t come. This has been happening ever since.\n\nJudge:\nSo tell me about when she hit you with the car. Is it this night that we’re talking about when you come home?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, that was the 4th of October.\n\nJudge:\nSo how did it happen? Tell me about it.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nShe wouldn’t back out of the driveway so I could get in. She looks at me and goes, “I should hit you with this car,” and she backs up and she hits me on my leg, kind of, and I’m like, “Did you just hit me?” and I try to hit her.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI tried to go through the cars. Could you... how?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nHow though?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI tried to go through the cars. Could you... how?\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened? What did you hit?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNothing. I just swung my arm inside the passenger window.\n\nJudge:\nYes, you ended up getting arrested for this?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNo, I didn’t get arrested the next day.\n\nJudge:\nYou got arrested.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, I want to get arrested the next day. Yes, that’s when I got arrested.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, so let’s hear what happened. Happens. You start yelling because they drive up and they’re too close or they’re in your area. Ask them to move because he’s coming back?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYeah, all the time. Move onto the driveway. This girl jumps out her car.\n\nJudge:\nWell, she’s still in the car?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNo, she wasn’t in the car.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nSorry, in other words, you don’t have a right to tell people not to exist in the easement?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nThey’re in the car. They didn’t leave it parked there. They’re in the car.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nShe did leave it parked. She got out of the car.\n\nJudge:\nNo, that’s not what you said. You said that you told her to move and then this girl got out of the car.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI listen right, which means there’s someone in the car. They’re not parked. Parked means you’ve abandoned your vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nSo you know, you’re not... you may have a right to the easement on that road, but I think you’re up in the ante just as much as she is. So you say, \"Get out of the car,\" whatever, and then she comes out of the car and does what?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nKicks her shoes off and comes at me.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what happens?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI have no choice but to defend myself.\n\nJudge:\nSo what happens?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nWe started fighting physically.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYou have kids?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nAnd, uh, were you there or no?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI was there when this happened.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI helped break it up. Me and her mom. Me and her mom broke it up.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nOh, we had a couple of adults.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then what happens?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nThey call the...\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nWho calls the police?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nHer, her mother or her friend. They call the police.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then the police come over and then do you get arrested?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then you go to jail? How long are you in jail?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nI was in jail for almost 19 hours.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and they set your bond kind of high?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes, because she said I hit her with the car, and so they said it was...\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nDo you have any priors?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nAnyway, they set it at 30,000?\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo your mother posts the bond, which means she’s out three grand. And then you are coming to court to sue for $2,500 for false arrest because you say she’s lying about you hitting her with the car. She’s got a witness who says that you did hit her with the car. It was just them towing the car. Of course, he’s going to be on.\n\nDefendant (Elora):\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nThey get out with her.\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nYes.   Judge:\nNow you have a counter claim against her for $2,000 for pain and suffering and defamation of character. Tell me what that's about.\n\nDefendant (Elora Wilson):\nMan, ever since this has happened, this girl keeps her windows all the way up in her house from the time I walk right to do that. That's right, that's it's nothing. But do you have the right to holler at me from my door all the way down the driveway? Bye, going to work, bye, watch out, the goons is going to get you, and all this screaming, harassing.\n\nJudge:\nDo you guys like living like this? Leave each other alone. Stop it. I don't grow up.\n\nJudge:\nStop it. Do not talk to each other. Do not yell at each other. Do not say anything to each other. Grow the heck up.\n\nJudge:\nI don't find that you've proven that this was a false arrest in the sense that you are able to prove that it didn’t happen. Now the pain and suffering and defamation of character that you're talking about, somebody yelling at you and saying things to you every time you walk into your house, doesn't cut that, and that doesn't entitle you to $2,000 on your lawsuit against her. Zero on your counterclaim against her also. Zero.\n\nJudge:\nWell, we have a tie in the People's Court and nobody wins anything. I don't know if this is going to settle the dispute between you two. What do you think?\n\nPlaintiff (Anita):\nI'm not going to say nothing to her. She's still a crackhead and I'm still going to live my life, and I'm still going to be there. And if she say anything or do anything, she’s just going to get beat up again.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, you might be back in court again, who knows?", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": "Evasion & Deflection,Guilt-Tripping,Playing the Victim,Gaslighting"}

He spent over 600 bucks on the thing, and the plaintiff had no right getting him arrested for theft. And if anyone’s owed money today, it's not the plaintiff. He’s accused of joyriding right into court.\n\n**Judge:** The defendant has filed a counterclaim for $600 for upgrades to the moped.

I called and reported it, and the same day, the police found him with it right in his own front yard.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, and what happened that day?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, the police interviewed him, and he basically lied and said somebody sold it to him, and they caught him in a lie. He admitted that he stole it.\n\n**Judge:** What happened then?\n\n**Defendant:** One day, I was, you know, drunk at nighttime, and I ended up taking the moped. I actually brought it back.\n\n**Judge:** How old are you right now?\n\n**Defendant:** I'm 20.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go on.\n\n**Defendant:** So, I ended up bringing it back, right? I was still messed up, and uh, I stopped all that stuff. It was wrong to take it in the first place.

Jordan doesn't own it; it's his.\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, he sold it to Jordan.\n\n**Judge:** No, I did not.\n\n**Judge:** So what happens is that night, you decide to go ahead and prosecute. So I guess at some point, the officer asked me what I want to do, and I said if he stole it, I want to press charges. That's what I told the officer.\n\n**Judge:** If he stole it—you know he stole it.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, yeah, I do, but—\n\n**Judge:** Why wasn’t he just arrested that night? I don’t understand. Did you change your mind about wanting to press charges?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, I never changed my mind.\n\n**Judge:** Because there's no other reason for why he's allowed to leave and then you say, \"I want to press charges.\"\n\n**Judge:** In any event, a warrant for your arrest—how much later do you get arrested?\n\n**Defendant:** Oh, like a month later. It was the 31st of October.\n\n**Judge:** So your testimony is that in that month, you bought it from your buddy Jordan?\n\n**Defendant:** Mhm.\n\n**Judge:** And did you see a bill of sale from this gentleman to Jordan?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I did. And the keys.\n\n**Judge:** And did you get a bill of sale from Jordan to you?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Where are both those documents?\n\n**Defendant:** They were in the moped.\n\n**Judge:** Well, that's unfortunate. He has them now.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have any proof of payment to Jordan?\n\n**Defendant:** I used to have text messages of it, but I don't have them anymore because I made a whole new account. He's in the hospital right now. He's very sick, so we can't talk to Jordan.\n\n**Judge:** You don't have a bill of sale, you don't have Jordan's bill of sale, you don't have an affidavit from Jordan. So you bought it for $700, and you're suing for $1,800. How do you figure?\n\n**Judge:** So the moped cost him 700 bucks, but he says to repair it, it's 1,800. Does he get the 1,800 bucks?\n\n**Audience Member:** No, he should get the $700 that he was out.\n\n**Judge:** But he says to fix it, it's 1,800.\n\n**Audience Member:** I think possibly he could get some extra damages for his inconveniences.\n\n**Judge:** Does he get the money beyond 700?\n\n**Audience Member:** No.\n\n**Judge:** The damages he did were more than the bike was worth. Did you have to pay for them to tow it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, I had to pay $100 for that.\n\n**Judge:** Do you have proof for that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, I sent it to you.\n\n**Judge:** I don’t see that. Do you have it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I have a plastic bag in my wheelchair if you can get—hold on one second.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, as best I can tell, going on the internet, the depreciated value is $500, and that's what I'm going to order the defendant to pay you, plus your court costs. And the $100 tow—$600 in total. Plaintiff wins.\n\n**Judge:** Good luck, folks.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "framing the narrative, deflection, minimization"}
{"id": "210", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, all parties please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket, the Plaintiff says her former boyfriend is stiffing her on furniture and other items she bought for him. To add insult to injury, he's using this stuff with his new girlfriend. But the Defendant says he still loves the Plaintiff. It's the case of No Love with a Love Seat.\n\nJudge: Hope Flanigan, you are suing your former boyfriend, Michael Pendergrass, for $496.29. You say he owes you for numerous things you bought for your apartment with him and that he has. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: We met in July of 2018.\n\nJudge: How did you meet?\n\nPlaintiff: On Facebook, through mutual friends.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh.\n\nPlaintiff: And it was love at first sight. And then we moved in in August of 2018.\n\nJudge: You moved in with a guy you'd known for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: A month.\n\nJudge: Seriously?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Do you do that often?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, how'd it work out for you?\n\nPlaintiff: We broke up in December.\n\nJudge: Oh, so not too well, right? And did you move from somewhere?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am. I moved from Georgia.\n\nJudge: You didn't just move in together. You moved from one state to another state to move in together, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: So you move in together.\n\nPlaintiff: And I acquired household furniture and items.\n\nJudge: But didn't you have stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: But where were you living before that?\n\nPlaintiff: With my parents.\n\nJudge: Okay, had you never moved out? You never had your own stuff, or you just didn't at this time?\n\nPlaintiff: I was married before.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it was a volatile situation.\n\nJudge: What was a volatile situation?\n\nPlaintiff: He had jealous rages.\n\nJudge: He does?\n\nPlaintiff: He does. Because of his previous marriage.\n\nJudge: Okay, so?\n\nPlaintiff: And he was going through my phone and causing problems.\n\nJudge: So how was he causing problems?\n\nPlaintiff: He was accusing me of cheating.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: When I wasn't cheating. And I found a friend that I was friends with in high school 25 years ago, and we were talking about our old high school friends. But there was no cheating involved whatsoever.\n\nJudge: But that friend crossed the line by saying some things he shouldn't have said?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, you mean he found some nasty texts or something?\n\nJudge: No?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, yes.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. So he gets mad, and then you guys break up. Tell me about the furniture. What happens? Do you move out of the apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: I did, yes, in the first week of December of 2018.\n\nJudge: Did you take everything with you?\n\nPlaintiff: My clothes. I didn't have anything to bring my furniture with.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say, \"Hey, I want the furniture?\"\n\nPlaintiff: I don't think so.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then how long did you live there after the breakup?\n\nDefendant: She moved out the first week of December. I stayed December, January. I just moved last week.\n\nJudge: Now, according to her, you bought everything on credit. You didn't have any cash to buy anything. And why didn't he buy stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: I do not know. Because we were in such a hurry to play house, right, that we had to set up a whole place. In fact, I bought a fireplace, like a portable fireplace.\n\nJudge: I did, yes. Right? Like one of those, you know.\n\nPlaintiff: He picked it out.\n\nJudge: Oh, that's lovely. But you put it on your credit card, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So you have like $5,000 in debt now?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And he has everything because you had nowhere to put it, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: All right, so where's the stuff?\n\nDefendant: In Leesburg, Florida, where I moved to.\n\nJudge: So you took it with you to the next place?\n\nDefendant: Yes, ma'am, I did.\n\nJudge: All right, so now tell me about your defense. Let's talk about the stuff.\n\nDefendant: When I lived in Georgia, I had my own apartment, had my own everything. She asked me, \"Why bring all that stuff? Just sell it, and we'll start fresh. I don't want something some other woman has had.\" So I sold everything and moved here.\n\nJudge: What did you do with the money?\n\nDefendant: We got the apartment with the money.\n\nJudge: Who was paying the rent?\n\nDefendant: I did.\n\nJudge: How much was the rent?\n\nDefendant: $1,200 a month.\n\nJudge: And why didn't she pay any rent?\n\nDefendant: Because she's a woman. It's not the woman's job to pay the rent. It was mine.\n\nJudge: Oh wow. God bless you. All right, so because of her gender, she doesn’t have to pay rent? You hear that? I want to make sure everybody heard it in case you suckers were paying rent in places that you were living.\n\nJudge: You didn't pay rent, so she wants you to pay off all of her balances because, according to her, you owe it. Why would he owe it?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he used everything.\n\nJudge: Okay, so let’s settle this. I'm going to order the Defendant to pay the $297 in the electric bill because he says that's his to pay. As for everything else, we will make arrangements with Officer McIntosh for the furniture to be picked up by the Plaintiff. You will pay for the pickup and transport. It’s your furniture, and you can keep paying for it.

{"id": "414", "dialogue": "**Judge:** Mr. Goldar, what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff (Seth Goldar):** Well, I brought my computer in, Judge, to have the keyboard replaced, and when I went back later that day, it was a non-functioning computer.\n\n**Judge:** Did you receive any phone calls from him in the meantime?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I did. He called to ask me if it was a working computer when I brought it in.\n\n**Judge:** And what did you say?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Why would I put a new keyboard on a non-working computer and not mention it? I imagine that was the long and short of it.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah. And then what does he say?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He was sympathetic. He tried going back through the computer to see what was wrong with it, and when he realized it wasn’t working at all, he offered to send it somewhere else to have it fixed on his dime.\n\n**Judge:** So he sends it somewhere else, and then what does he tell you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** About a month later—three weeks or so later—it came back with the diagnosis that it was completely fried. Several parts were beyond repair, and they were unable to get parts to replace them.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so how do you two leave it? What happens? What do you say to him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** It was kind of a circular conversation. I asked him how we could fix this, kind of alluding to the idea that he would help out in some way for damaging the computer. And he just kept running circles around me.\n\n**Judge:** And saying what?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He was flabbergasted and astonished at how something like this could happen. And he’s never had anything like this happen in his 25 years of business.\n\n**Judge:** And how did you guys leave it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I left the computer with him. I went back a few weeks later—a week or so later—and picked it up after I kind of cleared my head and decided what to do.\n\n**Judge:** And what was it you decided to do?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Sue him, ultimately. Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Right. All right, so now, Mr. Johnson, tell me your version of these things.\n\n**Defendant (Kent Johnson):** Oh, he brought in the computer. He said it was a keyboard trouble, and he brought in the keyboard with it. I replaced the keyboard. When I put it back together and hit the button to turn it on, it didn’t turn on.\n\n**Judge:** Uh-huh.\n\n**Defendant:** So I called him, and he said no, it was working when he brought it in. Well, I don’t know what I could have possibly done that did this. So I took it back apart, and I checked every connection. And I—I have no idea how it didn’t work. So I offered to send it out to someone who could figure it out. I figured it must be a fuse or something somewhere. Those fuses are microscopic. I can’t do them here.\n\n**Judge:** Uh-huh.\n\n**Defendant:** And they said no, the board was bad. And not only that, but the LCD was bad, which—I have no idea how that could have happened.\n\n**Judge:** Well, didn’t you—I mean, when someone brings in a computer, don’t you have them power it up? I know that’s what the—\n\n**Defendant:** Yeah, I didn’t do that.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, no, you didn’t do that.\n\n**Defendant:** That’s—I did not check it before I took out the battery. I just started the whole thing, started the process.\n\n**Judge:** Are you sure you took out the battery?\n\n**Defendant:** I’m sure I took out the battery, yeah.\n\n**Judge:** So you then end up sending it out because you feel bad, and you pay to have it sent out and investigated. And what—you know, when they tell you—\n\n**Defendant:** Not really.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so you didn’t pay?\n\n**Defendant:** I paid shipping.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And it gets investigated, they tell you what’s wrong with it, and then what’s the plan? ‘Cause if he brought you a working computer and then, in your care, the thing somehow shorts, what’s the game plan? Just tough for him?\n\n**Defendant:** No, I—I mean, that’s what I keep telling Seth. I’m not going to—I'm not going to, like, negotiate with myself.\n\n**Judge:** What do you want?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I want a new laptop.\n\n**Defendant:** Well, I’m not going to buy you a new laptop. I mean, I didn’t say this to him, but I’m not going to sit here and say, \"How about half a laptop?\" I mean, you know, that’s kind of what the negotiation is.\n\n**Judge:** Back to the People's Court. The question: Did the defendant burn out the computer’s motherboard, or is this just a case where the plaintiff is trying to get something for nothing? Let’s go back to the courtroom and find out.\n\n**Judge:** You’re suing, Mr. Goldar, for the cost that you paid for it, plus the cost of the keyboard, plus tax of $100—which I don’t know where you got that. Remember, it’s the value of the item at the time of the loss. And you are talking about a laptop that was by then—how old?\n\n**Plaintiff:** One year. It was about a year old.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah. Not that old, but it had a broken keyboard or whatever that you were having fixed. My job is to assess the value of this item—its depreciated value at the time of the loss, if it were functioning correctly. Mr. Goldar, you paid $1,600 for the computer a year ago. You paid $200 for the keyboard. I have to depreciate it. You know that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** You know, this isn’t a criminal case. I don’t have to absolutely know what happened. I just have to look at the facts. And in a civil case, the standard of proof is much less than in a criminal case. In a criminal case, it’s beyond a reasonable doubt. But in a civil case, it’s by a preponderance of the evidence. You and I both know there’s no way he brings that thing in for you to change a keyboard if the thing isn’t working. Because what would be the point? You’d have a keyboard on a computer that’s not working. He’d tell you, \"Hey, and it’s not working, tell me, find out what’s wrong with it, diagnose it.\" That’s what he would say. Also, kind of shame on you for not making him do what the Genius Bar always makes me do, which is turn on your computer.\n\n**Judge:** So, I am going to order the plaintiff to be recompensed for the loss of the computer—$1,400.

{"id": "346", "dialogue": "Judge: Solomon Waserman, you are suing Boro Nof for $1,630 in rent and a sofa you say he took from you, new locks, and leaving you to pack his belongings. You are counter-claiming against him all of the cable, phone, internet bills that you paid during the short time that you folks lived together. Tell me what happened here. How did you two know each other?\n\nPlaintiff: We were members of the same synagogue, Young Israel of Long Beach.\n\nPlaintiff: What happened here? Mr. Boro Nof became a member and he was coming over there, staying in front of me, next bench to me, that's how we got to meet each other. Later on, unfortunately, he had some problem with his wife and they went into the separation and further into divorce proceedings. And then Boro asked me, or I offered, out of a good heart, that he can stay with me because I have indeed a relatively substantial house. I have rooms which were not used, so I offered him.\n\nJudge: Who did you live with in that house when you had him at that time?\n\nPlaintiff: I was alone.\n\nJudge: Right now?\n\nPlaintiff: Now I'm already married.\n\nJudge: Okay, so when does he come into your home?\n\nPlaintiff: I don't remember exactly the months. Probably it's somewhere in April.\n\nDefendant: I remember when I moved in, around March.\n\nJudge: And you moved in because you separated from your wife?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you moved in in March. Did you agree to pay rent or no?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nPlaintiff: He said please do not pay me, it's all free, you could use storage. Even before I asked him to stay there myself. But he also, again, reminded me it's out of the goodness of my heart and I would appreciate your company.\n\nJudge: If you're renting a room, how is it the goodness of your heart? You're either renting it or you're not. I mean, what does goodness of heart mean?\n\nPlaintiff: You know, he owes you all this back rent. Indeed, in the beginning, it was a goodness of heart to help him store his stuff. Later on, when he started to live with me in the house, at one point I thought that $250 rent for boarding Boro to stay in my place would be a very reasonable place. That's fine.\n\nJudge: But did he agree to that? Because he was already living there and you weren't charging him rent.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he agreed.\n\nJudge: Okay, so now it's not that he was supposed to pay rent from the beginning. It's that in the middle you said to him, I want you to pay $250 a month rent. Did he ever pay $250 a month?\n\nPlaintiff: He suggested because his money were tied up in a lawsuit with his wife that it would be easier for him to use the credit card and pay some of my bills.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then he went, and then he proceeded in May, June, July, August, September, and October. He paid the Verizon bill. Do you have proof of what you paid?\n\nPlaintiff: These are the credit card receipts I have, the credit card receipts matching the Verizon bills.\n\nJudge: How much do you think he paid in the cable bill and all that?\n\nPlaintiff: Some of them were plus dollars. Then I bargained them to come to the cheaper plan, so it started at $88 but I don't remember the charges of $600. It's 21644, I see, I see the proof of that.\n\nDefendant: I dispute the $600, it seems to be outrageous.\n\nPlaintiff: The $600, is everything he paid in July. There's one payment that I'm seeing on his credit card for $540 and then another one for $88. That's how it comes up to $628.30.\n\nDefendant: So the amounts are correct, he did pay $1,264. Is it for my telephone account?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it's that account. There's not... he's not paying somebody else's bill. The Horizon account number matches.\n\nJudge: Okay, tell me about the chofar. Am I pronouncing it correctly?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, chofar. It's a horn from an animal which is used on Rosh Hashanah to blow.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so it was stored in my living room. Boro saw it. He goes on Saturday to his father in a community of retired people, and he asked me to borrow it. I gladly gave it to him because it was just collecting dust and he never returned it to me.\n\nJudge: Where is it?\n\nDefendant: I had asked him if I could actually purchase it since it wasn't in use, and he said, no, you can only borrow it.\n\nDefendant: So I borrowed it and returned it promptly the next day.\n\nPlaintiff: Who did you return it to?\n\nDefendant: I took it from his shelf in the living room and I put it right back onto the same exact shelf.\n\nJudge: Did you ever tell him, \"Here, I brought it back\"?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I said thank you very much.\n\nPlaintiff: Is it on the shelf?\n\nDefendant: Did anybody look on the shelf?\n\nPlaintiff: Is it on the shelf?\n\nDefendant: It's not on the shelf.\n\nPlaintiff: It's not on the shelf?\n\nDefendant: It's not on the shelf.\n\nPlaintiff: What shelf did you put it on?\n\nDefendant: The same shelf I took it from in the living room.\n\nJudge: Okay, so if it was there, you would see it.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Somebody's lying.\n\nJudge: Okay, when did you move out?\n\nDefendant: Beginning of January 2015, 2016.\n\nJudge: Why did you move out?\n\nDefendant: One Sunday morning I woke up and he says my wife doesn't like you, you have to leave.\n\nJudge: When did the wife come in?\n\nDefendant: He was living alone when you moved in.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: He suddenly met a wife and got married two weeks later and she said, wait, wait, he met, he met a woman, he got married two weeks later. So how long were you dating before?\n\nDefendant: How, like two months, three months, something like this.\n\nJudge: That's kind of fast.\n\nDefendant: That's what the Jewish people do. They see, listen, you know, we like each other. We come from the same...\n\nJudge: Is it working out?\n\nDefendant: It's a very heated family relationship but, yes, we're working.\n\nJudge: Why did you ask him to leave?\n\nPlaintiff: I was doing some work for my friend in Connecticut, and my wife told me that Boro brought a lady overnight. It was very inappropriate in our opinion because we are observant. We don't want this kind of thing.\n\nJudge: So that offended your wife, so your wife said he's got to go?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nPlaintiff: And then I asked him to leave.\n\nJudge: So where did you go when he asked you to leave?\n\nDefendant: I got a U-Haul that night and I picked up my stuff and I had nowhere to go.\n\nJudge: Where'd you go?\n\nDefendant: I went to a hostel.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you stayed there for how long?\n\nDefendant: No, just for a day or two until I got a room.\n\nPlaintiff: She had actually not let me be in the house on my own without Solomon being there because she did not allow me to be in the kitchen, use the fridge. The bathroom was not working.\n\nJudge: Did you ever agree to start paying rent once you were there?\n\nDefendant: I agreed to help with utilities because.\n\nJudge: Is that something you hadn't been doing until that point?\n\nDefendant: I wasn't in the beginning.\n\nJudge: Did you ever agree to pay him $250 a month?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nDefendant: When I moved in, he had begged me not to pay. I would keep him company.\n\nJudge: And did he ever change that and say, \"I think you should pay $250 a month\"?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: No.\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nPlaintiff: What are you suing for, the new lock?\n\nPlaintiff: What's that about?\n\nDefendant: Boro, you have in front of you the... did you take the keys and you didn't give him back the keys?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he changed the locks.

{"id": "308", "dialogue": "Judge: Adam Ortiz?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: And Alicia Eagle?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. You're suing Michael Gambali, your former landlord, for $4,887.96 for items that were stolen from your apartment and for rent and security that you want returned because there was never any electricity. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, just to give you a summary of what's going on, in October, we were in another apartment, which was a bogus apartment.\n\nJudge: A bogus apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, meaning it was illegal, like they couldn't have rented to us. As a matter of fact, the landlord, through text message, said we needed to vacate the premises by the end of October.\n\nJudge: So you had to leave. So you rented his place?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I found his place through an ad on Craigslist. Everything fit well at the time. I needed to get out, or else it was either that or being on the street.\n\nJudge: Not necessarily. There are other alternatives, but okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly. That led us to Mr. Gambali’s house.\n\nJudge: What was he renting out?\n\nPlaintiff: He was renting out a one-bedroom apartment downstairs in his basement.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: He told us that the previous tenant had damaged an electrical box, and it needed to be replaced. That’s why there was no electricity in the apartment.\n\nJudge: So how did you see the apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: Flashlights.\n\nJudge: You picked out an apartment based on flashlights?\n\nPlaintiff: Unfortunately, yes.\n\nJudge: When did you expect the electricity would be turned on?\n\nPlaintiff: He said within a couple of days.\n\nJudge: And that didn’t happen?\n\nPlaintiff: That did not happen.\n\nJudge: Alicia, let me ask you a question. Did you see the place with flashlights?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And were you a witness to him saying it would be resolved in a few days?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you guys move in?\n\nPlaintiff: We moved our stuff in.\n\nJudge: And where did you go?\n\nPlaintiff: We stayed at a friend’s house.\n\nJudge: All right. So then what happened? According to you, throughout November, you kept checking, and there was no electricity?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. First, he said he was waiting for the town to do an inspection. Then it changed to needing an underwritten inspection sent to the electric company.\n\nJudge: So your stuff gets stolen. What is the day you realize this, and how do you realize it?\n\nPlaintiff: We went back and forth to the apartment every other day to get clothes, shower, or whatever at a friend’s house. On the 17th, I texted Michael Gambali, saying if he didn’t get the electricity on within a week, I wanted my money back. He never responded. On the 20th, we went to the apartment, and all our stuff was gone.\n\nJudge: All of it or some of it?\n\nPlaintiff: My electronics, like TVs, cameras, video game systems.\n\nJudge: You were about to live on the street, but you had a lot of toys.\n\nPlaintiff: I work hard.\n\nJudge: Why would you end up on the street? You can’t have it both ways.\n\nPlaintiff: We were just trying to find a place quickly.\n\nJudge: Were these people stupid to rent a place with flashlights?\n\nDefendant: I think they should have waited and seen the apartment in the light.\n\nJudge: So basically, then that happened, and you called the police?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. There were no signs of forced entry. It was an inside job. Only two people had keys: myself and Mr. Gambali.\n\nJudge: Did the last tenant have keys?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but I asked him to change the locks.\n\nJudge: Did you tell them to change the locks?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you change the lock? Wouldn’t you want to ensure the last people and all their friends couldn’t come in?\n\nPlaintiff: I left it to the landlord.\n\nJudge: What kind of landlord are you? Is this place even legal for you to rent?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Prove it.\n\nDefendant: I don’t have that.\n\nJudge: How do you figure you can rent an apartment with no electricity?\n\nDefendant: I expected it to be fixed before they moved in.\n\nJudge: Did they pay you rent?\n\nDefendant: They gave me $200 upfront. Then they moved in November 1st but had not paid in full yet.\n\nJudge: So how much did they pay in total?\n\nDefendant: $2,100.\n\nJudge: And they claim it was $2,400. Prove it.\n\nPlaintiff: We have text messages.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t prove the amount. You must prove your entitlement. You are lucky that he admits to $2,100. Why did you leave valuable electronics in a place with no electricity and a broken window?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought it was safe.\n\nJudge: But you acknowledged the window was broken.

This is a request for a report. Where is the actual report?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s all they gave me.\n\nJudge: Without proof of theft, I cannot award you for stolen items.

{"id": "258", "dialogue": "Judge: Angela Gaston?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: You are suing Ray Miller and L&M Auto for $5,566.18, the amount that you have put into a car that you paid him for. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am. I purchased a car last year, July 3rd, which was the day before the 4th of July.\n\nJudge: So, the very same day—as it often is.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, but by the same token, it was closed the next day, so I couldn’t contact him. The car started leaking.\n\nJudge: The car started leaking? What—from where?\n\nPlaintiff: Could you tell it was power steering?\n\nJudge: You couldn’t call?\n\nPlaintiff: So, when I did catch up with him, he told me to go ahead and get it fixed, and he said he would pay for it.\n\nJudge: He did take care of that?\n\nPlaintiff: He did. Yes, he did.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So then, I said, “Wow, I still hear the same sound.”\n\nJudge: Well, you never told me about a sound. Where was the sound?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, you know when something is wrong, you feel it. When I shift, there's a little drag. So anyway, I called Ray. I said, “Ray, I still got a problem. I’m still hearing the same thing.”\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, “Bring it in.” When I got there, the mechanic was there. Then, a few days later, the next time I got there, he didn’t have the plug that you plug in to tell you exactly what it is.\n\nJudge: The computer diagnostic tool?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. So, he told me to come back. The next time, he still didn’t have it.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Anyway, maybe two or three weeks later, he went to Vegas. He came back. By then, the 45 days was over.\n\nJudge: What 45 days?\n\nPlaintiff: The 45 days he told me he would guarantee the transmission and the motor.\n\nJudge: Do you have that in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I don’t, but that’s what he does. Like, if you finance it, he says, “Don’t worry about it. I’m telling you this is what I do to all my cars.”\n\nDefendant's Statement\nJudge: Mr. Miller, did you tell her verbally that you would cover it for 45 days?\n\nDefendant: I did tell her that. But she never got in touch with me within those 45 days.\n\nJudge: She says she did but couldn’t catch you.\n\nDefendant: The reason she didn’t contact me within those 45 days, Your Honor, is because there was nothing wrong with the car. She contacted me after the 45 days. And I still honored the warranty—I even gave her half the money on the transmission.\n\nJudge: What happened next?\n\nDefendant: She told me the issue happened just before the 45 days was up, and she just couldn’t catch up with me. So I agreed to help her.\n\nJudge: What did you do?\n\nDefendant: The actual transmission repairs cost $550—I gave her $275.\n\nJudge: So what work was done?\n\nDefendant: The transmission was actually replaced.\n\nJudge: It was replaced?\n\nDefendant: Yes, that got done. And then, some electrical stuff was wrong with the vehicle.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: Then, she contacted me and told me I had to pay for that too. I said, “I’m not going to pay for that.”\n\nJudge Requests Evidence\nJudge: Can you prove to me what’s wrong with the car and why he should have to pay for it?\n\nPlaintiff: Let’s assume there is a 45-day warranty.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: We are well past that. We’re almost a year later.\n\nJudge: Where’s the car right now?\n\nPlaintiff: Would you believe the car is still in the shop with the same problem?\n\nJudge: What’s wrong with it?\n\nPlaintiff: The mechanic says to fix this properly, he has to drop the motor and seal the seal around the transmission.\n\nJudge: Was a new transmission put into your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but the guy did not fix it correctly.\n\nJudge: I need to see evidence. Do you have any proof from your mechanic that the prior repair wasn’t done correctly?\n\nPlaintiff: Is it possible I can get him on the phone?\n\nJudge: Let’s try that.\n\nMechanic Joins the Call\nJudge: Hi, Rick.\n\nMechanic (Rick): Hello.\n\nJudge: How long has the car been in the shop this time?\n\nMechanic (Rick): I think about five weeks.\n\nJudge: When did she bring it to you?\n\nMechanic (Rick): When they put the transmission in originally, the problem wasn’t actually the transmission—it was the alternator.\n\nJudge: So, what happened now?\n\nMechanic (Rick): We took the transmission out, put in a front seal—\n\nJudge: Because the transmission was pouring fluid out?\n\nMechanic (Rick): Yes.\n\nJudge: Did that have anything to do with the way the original transmission was installed?\n\nMechanic (Rick): They probably didn’t change the seal.\n\nJudge: Are they required to?\n\nMechanic (Rick): Well, that’s a gray area. Some shops do, some don’t.\n\nJudge: What percentage of mechanics would have changed the seal?\n\nMechanic (Rick): About 50%.\n\nJudge: So, not an industry standard?\n\nMechanic (Rick): No.\n\nJudge: How much did that job cost?\n\nMechanic (Rick): $678.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Rick.\n\nFinal Verdict\nJudge: So, according to Rick, the prior mechanics didn’t take the extra precaution of changing the seal. But only 50% of mechanics do, meaning it’s not an industry standard.\n\nYou don’t have a written warranty.\n\nThe defendant helped you after 45 days.\n\nThe transmission was replaced.\n\nThe issue now is a seal—not necessarily the defendant’s fault.\n\nJudge: My verdict in this case is for the defendant.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "exxageration,playing the victim,evasion"}

{"id": "807", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please hit your radiance. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff rented an apartment with all sorts of problems, including electrical, so she bailed. But the defendant says the plaintiff is such a hoarder, she couldn't even come in to see if there were problems. It's the case of \"Hoarder We Hardly Knew Her.\" Thank you, Douglas. Monica, you are suing Jennifer. Neither of you want your last names mentioned for $1,550 of a security deposit that you want returned to you because you feel that Jennifer is unfairly keeping it. You feel that she breached the contract, and therefore, you're entitled to talk to me first. Okay?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: When I plug my electrical appliances in, everything was chipping out.\r\n\r\nJudge: What was chipping out?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: If I'm in this room and I turn on the light in another room, this one would chip out.\r\n\r\nJudge: So what's \"chip out\"? You mean the electricity?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, go on.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: So because another apartment is downstairs, I think the electricity needed was to upgrade it to like a 220. My fan wasn't working. The refrigerator, if the microwave is turned on, it chips out the light in the other room.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, did you tell your landlord this, and did she tell you about this?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: She did tell me that there were some electrical issues.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, did you remedy them?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, however, the reason that there were problems is because she actually put a freezer in that was prohibited, which I told her from day one. She clandestinely actually put the freezer there because I specifically told her that she could not bring any other refrigerator besides the one that I provided, which was a brand-new refrigerator for her.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, so was there any electrical work done by an electrician after she told you?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, because she had electrical outlets in the kitchen overloading the system. The building is from 1927, and the 120-volt will not support it.\r\n\r\nJudge: Did the electrician do any electrical work, yes or no?\r\n\r\nDefendant: He did.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, so what did the landlord tell you?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: She said I'm overloading it by putting too much stuff. She said it's because I brought in a freezer inside there.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right, so she told you to get the freezer out, but what happened?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I had meat in the freezer, and she gave me a small refrigerator that couldn't fit my meat.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, I understand. When did the problems arise between you and your landlord besides the electricity? Was it in April?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Well, from my move-in...\r\n\r\nDefendant: She came to inspect the apartment in May. She said I have to have everything unpacked by that time.\r\n\r\nJudge: But okay, why? What do you care whether she unpacks or not?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Oh, that's incorrect. From the day that Monica moved in, I'd like to tell you that she violated the lease. The first thing was she changed the locks without my authorization.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, that's a violation of the lease. You also had... she was obviously a hoarder. She had clothes piled five feet high, and I have pictures and a video of it, which is another violation. She had a china closet blocking the window, which is another fire hazard. She had personal clothing in the common area of the building.\r\n\r\nJudge: Wait, okay, so that the kitchen... that is the kitchen, right? What's that white thing?\r\n\r\nDefendant: That is actually the refrigerator, brand new. That's your refrigerator?\r\n\r\nDefendant: That's right. So that's the before. This is the kitchen after she moved her stuff in, and you can see the china closet is covering the window, which is a clear fire hazard. So that's the after.\r\n\r\nJudge: Let me just ask you a question. If no one else lives there, what skin is it off your nose if someone decides to do something stupid in their own house that they're renting from you? Is that a violation that you get a chance to complain about?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, it is because, well, first of all, my father was FDNY, so I know very much about fire hazards.\r\n\r\nJudge: But who does it make unsafe for besides herself?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Herself, but it's also... but she can't sue you for it if she decided to put that there. You didn't do it.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, we live in a very litigious society, so who knows how people can come up with frivolous suits. Okay, I'm sorry, we're talking... why are you interrupting?\r\n\r\nDefendant: But also, you can see all the items that are there, which is the fire hazard as well. So that was just one facet of the fire hazard. If you go to the next page, that's the before room, and then you can look at the actual... no, you can't even walk in there. Good Lord.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, that's a fire hazard in the sense of what you have declared, and I realize you're the daughter of a New York firefighter, but you have declared that having all that stuff is a fire hazard, and I'm not sure... I'm not sure like she's not storing combustibles.\r\n\r\nDefendant: She just... that's what I'm trying to tell you. She had a propane gas tank in the apartment as well.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, get out of here.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, she did.\r\n\r\nJudge: Did you have that inside of the house?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Is being a hoarder a fire hazard?\r\n\r\nJudge: I think it can be with a propane gas tank in the apartment.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, I think it can be.\r\n\r\nJudge: What you say? Yes, I think so too. I don't think there's any question going inside the courtroom.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I moved with it, not to keep it there because I have an outdoor...\r\n\r\nJudge: So did you ever move it out?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yes, I took it into storage. No, I took it out because it was a fire hazard.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, when... okay, when the people moved me in, they just brought the thing, so I had to move...\r\n\r\nJudge: Who are the people? These weren't professional movers? These were like your friends and relatives?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: No, they were movers.\r\n\r\nJudge: So when they moved the things in, they did not... so what... how long did you tell her you got to go?\r\n\r\nDefendant: So after I tried to bring the exterminator to actually do the regular extermination, that's when I... the exterminator couldn't even move in there because the exterminator couldn't do anything. Nobody could... forget about it, as they say. You couldn't do anything in there because they say here... so then, after I discovered that, I said I needed to come and inspect. I gave her a certain amount of time to correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: And you told her, \"Unpack your stuff and live like a person,\" and then...\r\n\r\nDefendant: Well, I didn't say unpack. I'm just saying, listen, you have to make it so that you can walk in, or I can get anything done. It was just... and so after that, I kept sending her notes. Listen, I need to do the initial inspection.\r\n\r\nJudge: Who else lived in that building?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Another... I have a letter also from the other tenant in the building describing her bad behavior.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yes, did... why was it that you weren't unpacked? You can't live like that. Why... why was it you weren't... I'm just curious.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: This is when I moved in because I moved in the things in the car. She wasn't there during your move.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay, she came afterwards, and according to you, how long after? A month? May?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yes, May. After a month, moved in April 1st. She takes the pictures in May, you say.\r\n\r\nJudge: So what... so yes, then normal people are asking, why does it look like this after a month?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Those clothes were sitting on my bed. I was unpacking them to fold them to put in my... it's me alone. It's myself. They were on my bed.\r\n\r\nDefendant: According to the other tenant, she says that you would hang your loads of smelly personal clothing in the common area of the building, and that that tenant spoke to the landlord about moving it. That you cluttered the backyard with ladders, tires, garbage pails, dirt, and plants, and that you didn't dispose of your garbage properly, as there were Popeyes chicken bones and garbage thrown in the back, which resulted in maggots and an unsanitary situation right under her window. I have a picture of that too.\r\n\r\nJudge: We were very happy after she left. Let me see the picture of the maggots.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Okay, look at the maggots.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yes, this is while she was still living there?\r\n\r\nDefendant: Yes, he always took the garbage out, the first-floor tenant, but then he kept going back there, and there were chicken bones, Popeyes stuff...\r\n\r\nJudge: That when you're finished. Yeah, so anyway, the disposal... she wasn't following those rules either. Okay, go ahead. Let me give you a chance to respond.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: The downstairs where those clothes are... there's a closet downstairs as you walk in. Those clothes there, I just lifted my clothes out of the car, and I hung them there with the intention to bring them upstairs.\r\n\r\nJudge: I don't buy that because there was enough time for the tenant to get angry, for the tenant to bring it to her attention, for her to go over, and for her to take pictures, which we all know happened a month after you moved in. So that's not... you do... oh, I put them there for a second. That's not true, and that's the common area. Those bugs she showed you in the back, those bags in the back...\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Yeah, those bags in the back, I had a freezer when I moved there. I moved with a freezer. I told her before I moved that I have a refrigerator, stove...\r\n\r\nJudge: And she told you you couldn't bring appliances there?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: No, no, no, she said I could store them in her garage because it's empty. No one is using it, so I could store my things in there.\r\n\r\nJudge: So I put... that doesn't mean you can plug them in and create an electricity hazard.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Okay, what I am by the way is relevant because if you're creating an electricity hazard, now we've got something that's going to light up all those boxes and clothes.\r\n\r\nJudge: I did not create... okay, I didn't.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: There is the meat from the freezer. I had to take them. I put them... there's no reason why there should be maggots in... if you know you're putting away meat, then go dispose of it properly so the maggots don't come.\r\n\r\nJudge: I didn't see no maggots. I don't know what's that.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Those are maggots.\r\n\r\nJudge: I was there, and I didn't see them.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Those are maggots, and according to the neighbor, that was right under his window.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: It's not true. They are lying.\r\n\r\nJudge: Look, you know, when I was in law school, the place where myself and my four roommates lived... this fellow had the poor taste to rent out his place to five law students. He actually went around and wrote us a nasty letter about numerous things that he didn't want to happen again, including my underwear was on the floor. Okay, if I want my underwear on the floor of a place I am paying rent for, my underwear is going to live on the damn floor, and you are a dirty old man for writing me a letter discussing my underwear on an unannounced visit in my place. Okay, so you couldn't get a more sympathetic judge to the fact that you're renting the place and that you need to have privacy. However, this is not somebody walking in the day after you move in. This is somebody who told you, \"I'm going to come in and do an inspection.\" It's right in your lease that she's going to walk in and do an inspection. Okay, she has to worry about another family who's living there. You're putting in plugs in places where overloading the electrical circuitry, and then you've got a storage room going on there. And she doesn't say get out. She says you've got x amount of time to cure, and then you don't, and then she says you got to get out. You're in default, and then you leave, and then she keeps one month's security. There were two months' security on the table. She returned the other security, but she kept one month. Why? Because you signed a lease that specifically says she can do that if you default, and that's the reason why you have to leave. It's right in the lease. Right? Did you read the lease?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: I didn't. I didn't. I don't remember that that was there.\r\n\r\nJudge: I'm calling it. She has a right to keep one of the two security deposits. I find that you're the one who defaulted. My verdict in this case is for the defendant.

Paid at the DMV, then at the tow yard. When I got to my car, I saw scratches on the front left bumper.\n\nJudge: You have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. If you need to see a clearer image, I have my phone.\n\nJudge: Let’s see it.\n\n(Plaintiff shows images)\n\nJudge: That’s bad. Now, why had you had the insurance company do an inspection of your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I had just gotten the car. They require a photo inspection.\n\nJudge: So, coincidentally, they took pictures of it earlier that day?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: That’s bad for you, Defendant. Let’s hear your side.\n\nDefendant: We towed the vehicle. He was parked by cement blocks. We towed it from the back. We opened the vehicle, put it in neutral.\n\nJudge: Do you have video of this tow?\n\nDefendant: No, but we have video of a similar tow showing we don’t touch any areas.\n\nJudge: But he’s not saying your tow hook damaged the car. He’s saying your driver wasn’t careful pushing it away from the block, causing the damage. Do you have video proving otherwise?\n\nDefendant: No, we don’t have video of that tow.\n\nJudge: You were supposed to have a video, and it magically disappeared. There’s damage to the front bumper, which wasn’t there earlier that day. When do I rule against you and put you out of your misery?\n\nDefendant: (Silent)\n\nJudge: I like you, but it’s going to be $397.39 plus your court costs.

{"id": "819", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant’s 90 lb dog attacked her 9 lb Yorkie, Bella, and won’t pay the vet bills. But the defendant says the Yorkie was on her property, and the pooch stared her dog down. It’s the case of no Bella.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Ronda Marin, you are suing Galina Blatcher for $2,394.20 that you are out as a result of a dog bite when, according to you, her dog got loose and came out to bite your dog, correct? Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: So it was a Friday night, Memorial Day weekend. I was walking my dog like I normally do. We live in a community. As we were coming down her block past her house, my dog barks. Little dogs bark. All dogs bark at other dogs.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s what my—my husband—my husband wouldn’t let me get a small dog because he’s worried that they’ll yap.\n\nJudge: Your dog’s a yapper?\n\nPlaintiff: She—well, yes. Outside, yes. Even at cars. So she’s a yapper, and she was just barking. And the next thing I know, Galina’s dog came barreling out from the backyard. There was no fence. There were no sidewalks, and I have pictures to show you that there were no sidewalks.\n\nJudge: So you have to walk in the street because you can’t walk on anybody’s—where were you when the attack happened?\n\nPlaintiff: In the street.\n\nJudge: Where was your dog when the attack happened?\n\nPlaintiff: With me, on a leash.\n\nJudge: Where in the street did the scuffle happen?\n\nPlaintiff: The first bite happened on her back. Then, as I was trying to pull her away, the second bite happened here, in her left groin. At that point, by the time I finally got my dog, she came running out and was able to get her dog and brought her dog from the street into her garage at that point.\n\nJudge: So according to you, when she comes out, she comes to the street to get her dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Absolutely.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: Because I was in the street. My phone was in the street. My sneakers were in the street.\n\nJudge: Your sneakers flew off your feet?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, everything got crazy because my dog got bit. The sound of a dog getting bit is not a pleasant one. So I was a little disturbed at that point. I just said, \"I’m calling the police.\" And she said, \"You should not be walking your dog down this street.\"\n\nJudge: It’s—\n\nPlaintiff: We can walk our dogs wherever we want. Now, my dog has had a previous altercation with the same dog.\n\nJudge: With the same dog? How long ago?\n\nPlaintiff: Two years ago, on the 15th. And I have the vet report from that time. I did not report it at that time because I was with my other dog walking, and it was an honest mistake. She opened up her garage, she had a dog with her, and the dog just ran. I didn’t press charges because my dog got bruised, but there were no issues at that point. I presented her with a bill at that time, and she paid it.\n\nJudge: Is that accurate? Had your dog gotten out once before and attacked that dog?\n\nDefendant: Not exactly. It’s first time it happened. And she gave me bill written down by hand. I paid her money.\n\nJudge: How much was it?\n\nDefendant: Like, I don’t remember. Close to $300.\n\nJudge: Okay. But how did your big dog get out to bite her?\n\nDefendant: Me and my dog, we were behind the house in the backyard. But immediately, when my dog felt her dog, she felt free and ran.\n\nJudge: Wait, hold on one second. You and your dog were in the backyard?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Doing what?\n\nDefendant: Sitting. She was on a leash. But when she heard this one, nobody can stop in a second. I was behind her. I thought, \"Oh.\" And she already came down and waiting for me.\n\nJudge: Your dog?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Where was she sitting?\n\nDefendant: I have pictures.\n\nJudge: Okay. I’ll see them. Come on up.\n\nDefendant: Here. This is my property.\n\nJudge: All right. Did Animal Control come?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Were you issued a summons?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I paid $25.\n\nJudge: How much?\n\nDefendant: $25.\n\nJudge: Okay. The problem is, your dog got loose. You admitted paying a bill one time before. You’ve paid her twice now. Why do that if it’s not your fault?\n\nDefendant: Because I don’t want problems.\n\nJudge: That’s not how it works. Pay the lady.

Tell me what happens here.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, so I was throwing his fraternity brother, which happens to be my actual best friend in real life.\n\n**Judge:** In real life as opposed to fraternity life?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes, I'm not in his fraternity. Okay, um, I was throwing a birthday party, a surprise birthday party for him, and I was referred to DJ Dre through one of their line sisters. And I, you know, I reached out to him and tried to book him for the service or actually booked him for the service. I booked him for the 27th.\n\n**Judge:** 27th of?\n\n**Plaintiff:** March.\n\n**Judge:** And what day did you book him?\n\n**Plaintiff:** For the 27th of March, I believe I sent the deposit March 14th.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, go on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I went on to book him for the event. Due to finances, I had to cancel the event on the 22nd.\n\n**Judge:** Why?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Me and his fraternity brother's mom were the only ones paying for the event.\n\n**Judge:** Cuz were other people—well, why are you throwing a party you can't afford? What was the plan originally?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That everybody would contribute.\n\n**Judge:** Other people?\n\n**Plaintiff:** And then they didn't come through.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, this is so sad. Does he know that we have all this litigation over what should have been his birthday party? Does he? It's like he must feel terrible.\n\n**Plaintiff:** I tried. I tried to not tell him about it.\n\n**Judge:** Well, he's going to know now, pal, because you're on national television. As it turns out, you changed your mind about the party, and then you tell—because of what you just said—and then you tell Dre that you want the money back. And what does Dre tell you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He tells me no, he doesn't do refunds.\n\n**Judge:** Right. And then your answer to that is what?\n\n**Plaintiff:** That's not what was said in the contract.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And what was said in the contract?\n\n**Plaintiff:** So he sent me a note, and he sent me what I would be paying is for a deposit and the rest of the money and everything else that we cover, right? Um, under the deposit area, it doesn't say anything about non-refundable, refundable, none of that.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, and let me hear from you, Dre. Why won’t you return the guy’s money?\n\n**Defendant:** So, um, as I told him in the text messages, I don’t do refunds on deposits. Like, it’s kind of an industry standard for any industry that really does deposits.\n\n**Judge:** Why? What’s the purpose of a deposit, Dre?\n\n**Defendant:** So it's an insurance for us, honestly. Uh, we commit to whatever you want us to commit to, same with you committing to us. Then, um, yeah. So I’m turning down other gigs, any preparation work I got to do—\n\n**Judge:** I mean, what do you think, Mr. Willis? Is the premise of a deposit to book you for the date?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** So what makes you think that you can put down a deposit and then just turn around and say, okay, you’re reserving that date for me, to the detriment of all other people and your own business, but you know what? I want it to be for free. So I changed my mind. In other words, the fact that it doesn’t say non-refundable—the default position is that it’s non-refundable. That’s the point of a deposit. You’re taking something off the market, whether it’s a car or a house or his services for a certain date. He’s taking it off the market on your behalf. And so, you know, then you change your mind. Why would you not lose the deposit?\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to the People's Court. The plaintiff says the defendant's simply an unscrupulous businessman who stole his money. The defendant certainly doesn't see it that way. Let's go back into the courtroom and see who's right.\n\n**Judge:** On his claim against you, zero. And on your counterclaim against him, also zero. Good luck, gentlemen.\n\n**Judge:** So there are no winners in this case in the People's Court. Both the plaintiff and the defendant have lost their suits.\n\n**Judge:** That’s going to do it for us now, and we will see you in the next session of the People’s Court.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, deflection"}

But the defendant says he never even touched the engine, so the fact is, the car is a junker. It's the case of Hoop D No Can Do. Litigants have been sworn.\n\nJudge: Sounds like Shamika Hewitt, you are suing Robert D. Gregorris’s dealership. All right, we've agreed not to mention that you are a franchisee of a major manufacturer of cars. You don't want their name mentioned, and we'll respect that.

Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I purchased a vehicle February 1st from a private party.\n\nJudge: From a person?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, it was a dealer in Delaware.\n\nJudge: A dealer. Okay. And then you drove back to New York?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. Okay. Yeah. The steering wheel was shaking, so I took it to a mechanic.\n\nJudge: Had you test-driven it beforehand?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: It was not shaking when you test-drove it, right?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I had it for a couple of days.

But the steering wheel hadn't been shaking when you bought the car? That was something that happened on the drive down?\n\nPlaintiff: Right. Okay. Yeah. So then I took it to the mechanic when I got to New York.\n\nJudge: And?\n\nPlaintiff: He said I needed control arms and the wheel bearings. So I said okay. When he put it on a lift, he said the frame on the inside of the car was cracking. He looked something up and came back and said, \"Did you know that these trucks had a recall on it?\" I said no, I had only had it a couple of days. He said, \"Yeah, it was about two years ago. They had a recall on it.\" Before he did the work, he said to have them fix the frame first.\n\nJudge: So you called the dealer. You took it to them, and they fixed it. The recall was for what?\n\nPlaintiff: The recall was for some rusting on the strut towers, where the shocks go into.\n\nJudge: Okay, that's a recall. So he takes care of the repair. You take the car, and then what happens? Do you take it back to the first guy so that you can actually get the repair your car needed?\n\nPlaintiff: No. When I picked it up, the car was barely moving.\n\nJudge: What does barely moving mean?\n\nPlaintiff: It was in four-wheel drive. The oil light was on. There was a loud knocking noise when the man brought it out to me.\n\nJudge: And?\n\nPlaintiff: I said, \"What happened to the truck? It wasn’t like this when I brought it to you six days ago.\" He said, \"Oh, I don’t know, I didn’t touch it.\" So I called inside. He went inside to tell them I could barely move the truck. They said they would send somebody outside. A man came outside, drove the car back and forth to get it out of four-wheel drive.\n\nJudge: Why was it in four-wheel drive?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked him that. He said, \"I don’t know, I didn’t touch the car.\" So I said, \"Okay, could somebody find the guy who did touch the car?\"\n\nJudge: Defendant, what happened that day?\n\nDefendant: The vehicle was in four-wheel drive because there was a snowstorm that day. The body shop had to put the vehicle in four-wheel drive to move it.\n\nJudge: So they performed the repair, and then she picked it up?\n\nDefendant: Yes. She didn’t know how to return it to two-wheel drive.\n\nJudge: Did somebody take it out of four-wheel drive for you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what was wrong with it?\n\nPlaintiff: The oil light was on. The man who came out said I didn’t need oil, but the light kept flashing.\n\nJudge: Defendant, was the oil light on?\n\nDefendant: No, it was not.\n\nJudge: You take your car to a repair shop. They fix one thing, but it comes out with another problem.

She asked me to help return it.

This case is about whether the defendant illegally towed the plaintiff’s car and whether the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the tow fee and radiator damage. Let's begin. Mr. Uden, according to you, you were the unfortunate victim of a wrongful tow that damaged your car. Is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your Honor.\n\nJudge: Where was your car parked?\n\nPlaintiff: I park my car in the housing parking lot. My assigned number is 12.\n\nJudge: And were you legitimately parked there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I pay the rent every year.\n\nJudge: It’s not about paying the rent. Was the spot you parked in assigned to you?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, this is my parking space.\n\nJudge: Mr. O’Grady, you were asked to tow the car because it was what?\n\nDefendant: We were told it was illegally parked.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant: The reason was not given to us. The contractor called us to tow the car.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof that you were authorized to tow the car?\n\nDefendant: Yes, your Honor. Here is the receipt from the housing authority. They stamp it when the tow is requested.\n\nJudge: Is this a government housing project?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have been living there for 40 years.\n\nJudge: So, the housing people asked you to tow the car, and you feel that you were towed inappropriately because you were in your assigned space?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I was parked in my spot.\n\nJudge: Did you ever talk to them about it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but they denied responsibility. They said it was my responsibility to check the number. I had the sticker with my plate number and parking number 12.\n\nJudge: So, they are saying you weren’t in number 12?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I was in the right spot. They did not check the windshield sticker.\n\nJudge: Mr. O’Grady, do you know what space you towed him from?\n\nDefendant: That’s between him and the housing authority.\n\nJudge: Mr. Uden, what happened when you got your car back?\n\nPlaintiff: The radiator was leaking. I took it to a garage, and they replaced it.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipt for the radiator repair?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here it is.\n\nJudge: That’s what you’re suing for, correct? The $415 for the radiator and the tow fee?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Mr. O’Grady, if you damaged the radiator, you would be responsible for replacing it. How do you respond?\n\nDefendant: Towing does not normally damage a radiator. I provided a video showing how we tow vehicles properly.\n\nJudge: Mr. Uden, do you have evidence that the towing caused the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: The car was not leaking before. After the tow, it started leaking.\n\nJudge: But do you have documentation from the mechanic stating that the tow caused the damage?\n\nPlaintiff: No, they did not give me anything specific.\n\nJudge: Mr. O’Grady, how do you tow cars?\n\nDefendant: We use a standard wrecker with a front lift and install dollies on the back wheels.\n\nJudge: Where is the radiator in the car?\n\nDefendant: In the front.\n\nJudge: Do you have any additional evidence linking the tow to the radiator damage?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: What year is your car?\n\nPlaintiff: 1997 Toyota 4Runner.\n\nJudge: That’s an old car. I have to consider whether the radiator failure was due to age rather than towing. Also, you are suing the wrong person. Mr. O’Grady was following orders from the housing authority.

You're suing him as owner of the salon for $315, a replacement cost for eyeglasses that you say were stolen from the salon. Talk to me. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so I went there to have my haircut back on Thursday, March 24th, in the evening. And I sat down in the stylist's chair. Uh, there was no space to put my glasses on her personal shelf, so there was a Parson table to my left, and I reached out, and I took them off and placed them within arm’s reach on this table to my left. When the haircut was complete, I turned to my left to pick up the glasses. They were gone.\n\nJudge: How far away from your body were your glasses?\n\nPlaintiff: Maybe 3 feet. Arm’s reach.\n\nJudge: Right. So wouldn’t you see somebody if somebody had taken your glasses?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not. I guess my peripheral vision is not the best.\n\nJudge: So at that point?\n\nPlaintiff: I mentioned it to the stylist. She had some employees, I presume some hair washers as I recall, come and help me look. We looked in a variety of—\n\nJudge: How are you looking? Because if you have no glasses on, are you not very—there is nothing worse than when I lose my glasses. I need to enlist an army to help me because if—without—if I don’t have them, I can’t find them. So it’s just a self-fulfilling—\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, very difficult, to say the least. So we looked for quite a while, you know, probably over an hour. And as you just pointed out, I do need my glasses to see. My vision is actually 20 over 150 in one eye, 20 over 300 in the other.\n\nJudge: Right, but why are you suing the salon? What did the salon do? You lost your glasses. Why—why is it responsible for you losing your glasses?\n\nPlaintiff: Somebody removed them from where I had placed them.\n\nJudge: Why is the salon responsible? Let’s assume somebody did take them. Who’s the somebody? Why is the salon responsible?\n\nPlaintiff: Because I walked—I—it happened there. I walked in there. I placed it, you know, within—\n\nJudge: What did they do wrong? Normally, when somebody has to pay you for something, they have to have done something wrong. So what did they do wrong? Do you have a—do you have a camera in there?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did you at one point tell him that you had a camera?\n\nDefendant: It was a salon somebody else owned. I didn’t—\n\nJudge: Did you at one point tell him that you had a camera going?\n\nDefendant: I never said that, no.\n\nJudge: Okay. According to you, somebody told you that?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he has a business partner, and he told me that there was a camera. He was going to review it, and when he did, he calls me and tells me that the videotape showed I came in without glasses.\n\nJudge: Okay. And I asked—come on out. Who are the ladies who are there? Are they witnesses? ‘Cause one of them is chicken-necking, so I think she—\n\nDefendant: This is Nancy, who interacted the whole night with him.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you guys ever see a camera, like see the—see the tape? Was there a tape?\n\nDefendant: No, there was—\n\nJudge: Was he just saying that to him to get him off?\n\nDefendant: He was just saying it.\n\nJudge: But this is very interesting—kind of rude.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: Right. Because you're saying the glasses were stolen. If you’re saying you came in without them, then you’re calling him a liar.\n\nDefendant: I never said that to him.\n\nPlaintiff: His partner did.\n\nJudge: His partner did. But his partner's not the one who’s being sued.\n\nPlaintiff: Right, but his partner said it in the course of handling it for him.\n\nJudge: Okay, so why would his partner say that?\n\nPlaintiff: To deflect the situation.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you’re assuming that.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Do you have anything beyond that? Do you have a police report?\n\nPlaintiff: I did file a police report.\n\nJudge: Okay. And?\n\nPlaintiff: Nothing came of it.\n\nJudge: Right. Because what’s a police officer gonna do? Say, \"Hey, everybody in the salon, empty your pockets?\" That’s not how it works.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: Right.

I don’t want to know about his mechanic. I’m asking, did you, the one buying the car, have a mechanic check it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I looked at the car. I started it up. It needed gas. And then I said, \"Are you sure it’s okay?\" He said, \"Yes, nothing’s wrong with the car.\" He said, \"If anything’s wrong with it, I’ll fix it.\"\n\nJudge: Did he put that in writing, that warranty you just mentioned?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he didn’t.\n\nJudge: Because this is a 13-year-old car. So if somebody says, \"If anything’s wrong with it, I’ll fix it,\" that’s really important to be able to prove.\n\n(To Defendant) Did you tell her that if anything was wrong with the 2015 Accord, you would pay to fix it?\n\nDefendant: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Yeah, watch out. Because when you say something like that, you better be able to prove it, because that kind of amazing warranty on a used car doesn’t usually happen.\n\n(To Plaintiff) So, you took the car home. When did you start having problems?\n\nPlaintiff: To be honest with you, after I put gas in it. I drove it maybe 20 minutes. I told him, \"I really hope I didn’t just buy a messed-up car.\" He said, \"No, the car is fine.\" Then he asked, \"What kind of gas did you put in?\" I said, \"89.\"\n\nJudge: And what did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"That’s what made the check engine light come on.\"\n\nJudge: Where did you get the idea that putting in the wrong octane gas can cause a check engine light to come on?\n\nDefendant: From mechanics, ma’am. From having previous cars and putting bad gas in my own cars.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I called him, but we were both on the parkway, leaving from Queens back to Long Island, so he didn’t answer. When I got home, he called me back and said, \"It’s because you put 89 in it.\"\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nPlaintiff: He told me to \"drive it out.\" So I drove the gas out and put in 93, but the check engine light was still on.\n\nJudge: How many days later was this?\n\nPlaintiff: Maybe a day and a half.\n\nJudge: And then?\n\nPlaintiff: I called him and told him the check engine light didn’t go off.\n\nJudge: When did you finally take it to a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: Maybe that following Wednesday.\n\nJudge: How long after purchasing the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Three or four days.\n\nJudge: And what did the mechanic tell you?\n\nPlaintiff: He gave me a report and told me I shouldn’t have bought this car.\n\nJudge: Let me see what the mechanic gave you.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over documents.)\n\nJudge: And this bill of sale—when was it prepared?\n\nDefendant: More than a week after she got the vehicle. And actually, I just assisted her in acquiring a vehicle. I took her to A1 Auto Sales.\n\nJudge: That’s not you?\n\nDefendant: No, I’m an independent contractor under A1.\n\nJudge: How did you make money on the $1,400?\n\nDefendant: I didn’t make any money on her because I knew her.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you make money?\n\nDefendant: She bought a 13-year-old car, didn’t get it checked out, and now wants a refund.\n\nJudge: Why are you signing a bill of sale a week later if you had problems in the first three days?\n\nPlaintiff: Because he told me—\n\nJudge: No, no. Why?\n\nPlaintiff: He said—\n\nJudge: The default position is as-is for a used car.\n\nPlaintiff: But the mileage was wrong!\n\nJudge: Prove that.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over another document.)\n\nJudge: This doesn’t prove mileage fraud.

{"id": "933", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant spilled a drink on his laptop and ruined it. But the defendant says the laptop was hidden, so it’s his problem. It's the case of La Dancing.\n\nJudge: Brian O'Gorman, you are suing your former friend Casey for $755, the cost to repair a laptop that was damaged as a result of what you say is her negligence. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, for New Year's Eve, I organized a little get-together of our close friends. There were about 15 of us total. We got four hotel rooms, so no one had to drive. We arrived around 6:00 PM. My roommates and I dropped off our baggage and then brought food up to the girls’ room. We had all made food to eat.\n\nJudge: And she's one of your good friends who was renting another room?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How long have you two known each other?\n\nPlaintiff: About seven years.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: After eating, we had a couple of drinks, then went back downstairs to shower and get ready for the night. While I was downstairs, my friend Chris and I discussed where to put our belongings so they wouldn't be in anyone's way. We didn't want anyone going through our bags or anything. Then we discussed the laptop. I didn’t want anything to happen to it, so Chris suggested we put it up high, out of the way.\n\nJudge: Where exactly did you put it?\n\nPlaintiff: On top of the armoire.\n\nJudge: How tall is the armoire?\n\nPlaintiff: About 5'10\".\n\nJudge: Were you trying to hide it, or just keep it safe?\n\nPlaintiff: Just wanted it out of everyone’s way. I didn’t want anyone messing with it.\n\nJudge: Was it open or closed?\n\nPlaintiff: It was open because it was playing music.\n\nJudge: So it was open at a 90-degree angle?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Later, after we got ready, the girls came down. About 40 minutes later, Casey put her drink up there, and it spilled over onto my laptop. Another friend quickly grabbed the laptop, took it to the bathroom, and tried drying it with a towel and a blow dryer. Then we put the laptop away, and I told Casey, “It’s New Year’s Eve, let’s just enjoy the night.”\n\nJudge: What was her reaction?\n\nPlaintiff: She kept apologizing.\n\nJudge: Was she drunk?\n\nPlaintiff: None of us were drunk. It was still early in the night.\n\nDefendant: Like he said, there were about 15 of us. I had my first mixed drink in my hand, and people wanted to take pictures. I didn’t want alcohol in my pictures because they would probably go on Facebook, and I wanted to be professional.\n\nJudge: You’re 21?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Everyone in the room was 21?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Go on.\n\nDefendant: I was trying to do the responsible thing. I didn’t want alcohol in my pictures. So, I looked around for a place to put my drink and saw the dresser. I had no idea his laptop was up there.\n\nJudge: How tall was the dresser?\n\nDefendant: Probably about twice my size. I’m 5'1\".\n\nJudge: You’re saying you had to stand on your tiptoes?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I was in high heels.\n\nJudge: If you had to stretch to put your drink there, why choose that spot?\n\nDefendant: It seemed like the safest place where no one would knock it over.\n\nJudge: Did you see his open laptop?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn’t see it. I had no idea it was there.\n\nJudge: But it was playing music, and it was open at 90 degrees. Wouldn't you have noticed it if you looked?\n\nDefendant: I just didn’t see it.\n\nJudge: So, you admit you put your drink up there, and it spilled?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: You understand that’s negligence, right?\n\nDefendant: I mean, I don’t think I’m 100% responsible. He knew the risks of having an open laptop at a party where people are drinking.\n\nJudge: Did you offer to pay?\n\nDefendant: I offered to pay half. I said I could give him $500.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but then she changed her mind and took back the offer.\n\nDefendant: I don’t have a job, so I said I could pay when I got one in the summer.\n\nJudge: Do you have a picture of the armoire?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: [Looking at the photo] How could you not see the laptop? It’s clearly visible. It’s your fault, and I’m ordering you to pay the full $755 plus tax and court costs.\n\nJudge: That’s my verdict.

Thank you.\n\nJudge: Tian, you’ve asked us not to use your last name?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, please.\n\nJudge: Okay, Tian. You’re suing Francis Pedford Johnson, your former landlord, for $2,800 for not returning your security deposit from back when?\n\nPlaintiff: 2010.\n\nJudge: 2010. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I knew Francis for a couple of years, we worked together, and when I was looking to move into a new apartment, she told me she had a multi-family home. I moved into her apartment, I lived there five years. It was an easy agreement, month to month. I gave her two months' security deposit.\n\nJudge: How much did you give her?\n\nPlaintiff: $2,800.\n\nJudge: That was the security deposit? You gave her $2,800 plus the first month's rent?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And all she asked is that I live there at least a year and give her two months' notice when I was vacating. In August, I told her I was looking to relocate to Maryland, and I would know for sure and give her the two months that she asked for. In October, I gave her—\n\nJudge: So you were roommates, or it was a separate entrance?\n\nPlaintiff: She has a multi-family home. I was just renting one of her units.\n\nJudge: Got it.\n\nPlaintiff: I gave her my official notice in October that I would be moving in December. December came, and I moved out at the end of February.\n\nJudge: Did you pay rent in October, November, and December?\n\nPlaintiff: No. When I gave her my notice in October, she asked me if I was going to live out my deposit. I told her I had not planned to, but I would if she wanted.\n\nJudge: Good idea.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, I hadn’t planned on it. She brought it up, suggested it. I said I could do that. So, I didn’t pay rent in October.\n\nJudge: Then October 10th she called you and said?\n\nPlaintiff: She said, \"I didn’t get your rent check for the month.\" And I said, \"I’m living it out like you requested.\" And she’s like, \"Oh no, no, you know, you can’t do that. I need the money.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" I said, \"Well, I’ve already allocated the rent funds for October to my moving expenses.\"\n\nJudge: I don’t know what you’re saying. Did you pay October? Yes or no.\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not pay.\n\nJudge: Did you pay November?\n\nPlaintiff: No—I'm sorry, I did pay October.\n\nJudge: Did you?\n\nPlaintiff: I did not pay November.\n\nJudge: This isn’t hard. You had to know I was going to ask these questions.\n\nPlaintiff: Apologies. You did pay October, you didn’t pay November?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And did you pay December?\n\nPlaintiff: I gave her notice in October. I had already paid rent.\n\nJudge: You’re confusing me because you’re suing for the entire security deposit when you’re telling me point-blank that you didn’t pay November.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: So why aren’t you just suing for $1,300?\n\nPlaintiff: Because she flat-out just didn’t have it. She asked for more time, I gave it to her, and she took that as an opportunity to not pay me.\n\nJudge: Did she ever give you any inkling that she wasn’t going to pay you?\n\nPlaintiff: No, she just kept saying she couldn’t figure it out. First, she didn’t have it, then she asked for more time, then she said she wanted to figure it out.\n\nJudge: How long does it take? Two years to figure out?\n\nDefendant: The main reason is that Tian, when she left, she had her father, she had two other guys—well, she had about five people helping her move. And when she left, she left a huge air conditioner in the living room window, a small one in the bedroom window, and a huge—48 inches or 50 inches—television set on the bedroom floor.\n\nJudge: What reason did she give you for not taking them?\n\nDefendant: She said she told a couple of the young men they could have them and to contact me, but she never told me this. I had no idea.\n\nJudge: Did they contact you to try to pick it up?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Did anybody come pick up the ACs and the TV?\n\nDefendant: Finally.\n\nJudge: What’s \"finally\"?\n\nDefendant: February.\n\nJudge: And she moved out when?\n\nDefendant: The end of December.\n\nJudge: So, within 30-45 days, somebody had picked up the items?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you re-rent the place in January or February?\n\nDefendant: No, I couldn’t rent it with that stuff in there.\n\nJudge: You could have. You could have paid someone $50 to take the TV out. At some point, you have to hold on for a certain amount of days. Typically, judges require landlords to wait 30 days. And within 30 days, she removed it. So, why are you still holding onto $1,300?\n\nDefendant: There were other damages. She broke a window.\n\nJudge: Did you repair the window?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: What date?\n\nDefendant: It's recent.\n\nJudge: So, you waited two years to fix the window?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: How much did it cost?\n\nDefendant: $70.\n\nJudge: Are there any other reasons for keeping the $1,300?\n\nDefendant: She put holes in the walls.\n\nJudge: Did she patch them?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but the paint didn’t match.\n\nJudge: The paint you gave her?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Then you should’ve provided the right paint. You are not entitled to keep $1,300 for a $70 repair and a TV that was picked up in 30 days.

How?\n\nDefendant: Not considered my fault.\n\nJudge: What do you mean?\n\nDefendant: The insurance company didn’t consider it my fault because the lady was not considered believable.\n\nJudge: My point originally—I started off asking that to see if you understood how expensive bodywork is.

And it costs $1,405, which is what you’re suing for. Now, at some point, you guys had negotiated where you were going to pay how much?\n\nDefendant: He threw me the estimate of $1,800, so I was trying to figure out if I could maybe do something cheaper because I’m only 19 and—\n\nJudge: Because you’re only what?\n\nDefendant: I’m only 19 years old and I can only make so much money, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Okay, so he takes it there, and it’s $1,405 instead of—where did the figure $1,800 come from?\n\nDefendant: It was the original estimate.\n\nJudge: Which was from who?\n\nDefendant: The same body shop.\n\nJudge: And then they decided they were able to do it for $1,405?\n\nDefendant: Right. He was able to mix the paint in a cheap way.\n\nJudge: So then you tell him, \"Good news, it’s $1,405,\" and then he says what?\n\nPlaintiff: He said \"okay,\" basically, in a text.\n\nJudge: Okay.

Okay. You rented it to him for what?\n\nPlaintiff: For driving, like he was going to drive for Uber and all that stuff.\n\nJudge: Okay. And so you used the car, Mr. Zanada?

Then I said, \"Okay, for the first two weeks, I’ll give it to you for $300, but after that, you have to pay me $350.\" But in this time, within these two weeks, he had an accident. And when the two weeks passed, he never paid me $350.\n\nJudge: But you accepted $300?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, I accepted $300.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then the week after that, you also accepted $300.

You know, the car is a 2014 model. The average rent for this car from any car dealer is $300.\n\nJudge: When do you decide and why that you’re going to take the car back?\n\nPlaintiff: In July. What happened was, when I told him, he said he was going to raise the fee, but he only went up to $325. He said he was going to give me $350, but then he only gave me $325 a week. And that’s when I decided, no, I’m going to take my car back because I can’t do that.\n\nJudge: So then, on August 21st, you told him what?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him, \"You have one week.\"\n\nJudge: So on August 21st, you tell him he has until August 28th?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, and then he says, \"Okay, I’m going to give you the car back.\" But after two days, I noticed that he had a ticket pending. He didn’t pay that, and he didn’t even tell me. So the ticket came by mail, and I texted him that he had to pay it.\n\nJudge: Did you pay the ticket?\n\nDefendant: Your Honor, I was going to go for a hearing because it wasn’t my fault, and I wanted to contest it. But he put pressure on me to return the car. I said the deal wasn’t over, and he had to give me one week's notice.\n\nJudge: He did tell you one week in advance.\n\nDefendant: No, Your Honor, I have all the documents with me—texts, everything. I have proof of all my payments being $300. He never told me $350.\n\nJudge: Don’t worry about that. He’s not going to get $350 unless he has a contract that says $350 when he spent a year accepting $300. Now, you end up calling the police and telling them that he is not authorized to have your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you just call him and say, \"I told you to return the car\"?\n\nPlaintiff: I was calling him, but he kept telling me that he had another two tickets. He said if he returned my car, he wouldn’t pay those tickets. I have proof in the texts.\n\n[The judge reviews the texts and finds that the plaintiff repeatedly asked for the car back, while the defendant insisted on keeping it longer.]\n\nJudge: Did you pay for the week of August 28th?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: When did you get the car back?\n\nPlaintiff: On August 31st.\n\nJudge: How did you get the car back?\n\nPlaintiff: He left it five miles away from my home and left the key there.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you bring it back to him?\n\nDefendant: He was threatening me.

And you lived there for how long?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nThree years.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And during that time, did you get along just fine with him?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nOh yeah, he was good. But at the time, you know, when it was time for us to leave, he came up with everything that we had to fix.\n\nBut we didn’t mess it up.\n\nJudge:\nI got the pictures.\n\nSo, when you left, how much was your security deposit?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\n$1,050.\n\nJudge:\nIt was $1,050?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. He sent a check for how much?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\n$795.\n\nJudge:\nDid you cash it?\n\nPlaintiff (Kimberly Hamilton):\nNo, we didn’t accept it.\n\nJudge:\nSo what you’re saying is that he still owed you the excess of that, and he didn’t pay you that?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nWhich was how much?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nThe $255.25.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he said that there were those damages?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nCorrect.\n\nJudge:\nAnd were there?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nNo. Well, I will say—my son’s room and two kitchen knobs, I will pay for that.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened in your son’s room?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nMy son cut the screen.\n\nDiscussion of Alleged Damages\nJudge:\nOkay, so let’s go over originally what you were attempting to withhold.\n\nThe first thing on your list is two broken tiles in the bathroom.\n\nAnd it's $30?\n\nDefendant (Adam Wolak):\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a picture of the two broken tiles?\n\n[Defendant hands over a photo.]\n\nOkay, so there’s a crack in one, and a crack in another. Two tiles need to be replaced.\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nIf you walk in the bathroom, there’s a slope in front of the toilet. He knows that.\n\nBut he put the tile there, and after a while, you keep walking on it, it’s going to crack.\n\nJudge:\nHow did that crack?\n\nDefendant (Adam Wolak):\nSomething fell on that.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. What were you withholding for that?\n\nDefendant (Adam Wolak):\n$30.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nNext—damaged window sill. Do you have a better picture of that? The one up here is no good.\n\nDefendant (Adam Wolak):\nYes, I do.\n\n[Hands over photo.]\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you say happened to the window sill?\n\nDefendant (Adam Wolak):\nThat was their bedroom. They had an air conditioner in there, and the water leaked on the sill.\n\nYou can see the discoloration in the wood.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, that’s $25.\n\nNext—vanity mirror.\n\nPlaintiff, you admit that the mirror broke?\n\nPlaintiff (Nathaniel Hamilton):\nI asked him about it while we were still in the apartment. I said, “Adam, the mirror broke.”\n\nHe said, “Nate, don’t worry about the mirror. I have a piece of glass down at my other apartment, don’t worry about it, I’ll fix it.”\n\nJudge:\nSo why are you nickel and diming him about it now?\n\nFinal Judgment\nJudge:\nSo, what we’re left with then is $95 that you’re entitled to keep.\n\nYou are suing for double your security deposit because, according to you, he wrongfully withheld it.\n\nBut his requirement in your state is that he send you a letter and itemize things.\n\nI may find him to be wrong, but you want me to punish him as though he hadn’t sent you the letter.\n\nHe did send you the letter, and he did itemize it.\n\nSo your security deposit was $1,050.\n\nI am allowing him to deduct $95 for a little bit of this and a little bit of that.\n\nI am ordering him to return to you $955, plus, of course, your court costs.\n\nVerdict for the plaintiff.\n\n[Gavel bangs.]\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "exaggeration, gaslighting"}
{"id": "487", "dialogue": "Judge:\nPlaintiff, let us have the floor.\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nYes, Your Honor. I am suing 247 Pawn Shop, represented here by Shimle Kapor, for $5,000, the statutory max in our state because they have sold some items that I pawned for $250. Most of my lawsuit is for pain and suffering. I think it was around November 12th of 2011. I had a money problem, so I wanted to pawn a couple of things to get $200. I know what I pawned was worth more than $200, but I just needed the money at that time. I pawned three necklaces, two bangles, three bracelets, a ring, and a charm with a cross.\n\nJudge:\nHave you ever pawned anything before?\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nYes, Your Honor. It's usually the case that the loan is a lot less than the value of the item because they're not in the business of making a bad deal. But anyhow, I pawned it on November 12th, and I had until March 12th, 2012, to redeem my pawn.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have the paperwork from the pawn?\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nYes, Your Honor, here it is. On February 15, 2012, I called and spoke to this lady and told her I was coming in that Friday to pick up my pawn. She sounded kind of agitated, so I just said, \"Listen, I want to pick up my pawn by Friday, here's my ticket number.\" No problem. But I didn’t go that Friday because I got distracted. A week later, I called again to inform her I was coming, and that's when I found out the number was disconnected.\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nI immediately went to the location, and there was a new owner there. He said the previous owner didn’t leave anyone's property there. There were several people coming in to pick up their stuff. I went to the precinct to make a report, but they told me I couldn’t make a report; I had to go to small claims court. So, I filed with the Better Business Bureau and the Consumer Affairs office, hoping they could help me locate the people. I didn’t get any replies, so I just gave up.\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nLater, I received a certified letter on May 25th, informing me of the new location.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you guys move, ma'am?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nWe moved on November 28th, 2011.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t she get a letter until May?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nI personally gave her the letter and exchanged my phone number with her. I spoke to her. I told her if she wanted to extend the pawn, she would need to come to the new location. I told her about the new address, which was just down the street, and the phone number stayed the same.\n\nJudge:\nSo you personally spoke with her and gave her the new location?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am. I personally spoke to her.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you do that?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nIn January or February.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you do, call all your clients?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am. I personally went to their places and gave them the letters.\n\nJudge:\nSo you personally went to each and every customer’s home?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nReally?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nYou went to every single customer's home?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nI find that hard to believe.\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nNo, ma’am. I went to each and every customer’s home.\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying you personally went to the home of each and every customer?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nI find that hard to believe.\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nShe never called me.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have phone records that you called her?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nVerizon doesn’t provide phone records, Your Honor. I asked for the unlimited call details, but they don’t show phone numbers.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have proof of when you sent the certified letter?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, I sent the certified letter in May.\n\nJudge:\nSo you’re saying you personally went to everyone’s home, but you still sent the certified letter in May?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nI want to see proof that you sent the letter and when it was sent.\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nI sent it in May, and I personally visited each and every customer.\n\nJudge:\nWhy did you wait until May to send the letter?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nBecause the pawn expired on different dates. We were waiting for more time before sending the letter.\n\nJudge:\nBut you moved in November. Why are you sending the letter six months later?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nI was waiting for customers to pick up their pawns.\n\nJudge:\nSo you sent the letter in May, but you moved in November. Why did you wait until May to notify customers?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nWe were waiting for them to pick up the pawn.\n\nJudge:\nSo you’re going to notify her about the move after her pawn expires?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nYes, ma’am. She called me, and I gave her all the information.\n\nJudge:\nAnd now where is the stuff?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nIt has been melted.\n\nJudge:\nYou mailed the letter in May, but the letter says her pawn expired in March. That’s two months late. How do you explain that?\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nWe were waiting to send the letters.\n\nJudge:\nYou can't possibly think you abided by the law and your contract when you mailed the notice two months late.\n\nDefendant (Shimle Kapor):\nI was waiting for the customers to pick up their stuff.\n\nJudge:\nI'm going to award you $400, the value of the pawn, and an additional $500 in punitive damages for your fraudulent business practices.\n\nPlaintiff (Vette Holloway):\nI should have gotten more for my jewelry.\n\nJudge:\nI’m awarding you $900 plus court costs.\n\nJudge:\nThe defendant loses the case and has been ordered to pay the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "Defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Minimization, Deflection, Evasion"}

{"id": "757", "dialogue": "Judge: Niasia Myers, you are suing Scott Geller and GDT Automotive. You're the owner of GDT Automotive?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: For $2,726 that you want refunded to you—$1,500 of that a deposit that you put on a car that, according to you, he sold out from under you, plus $1,226 in car insurance.\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Talk to me.\nPlaintiff: So, um, originally I had looked on Craigslist because I was looking for cars and I wanted to find something cheap that I didn't have to make payments for. So I had talked to Scott. I reached out to him on Craigslist and he sounded like a nice guy, and he said that he was willing to help me with a down payment on a car because I didn't have it in full, but he was willing to take it in payments.\nJudge: All right, the deal you struck with him is that you would provide dribs and drabs until you got to $1,500, and you wouldn't be entitled to a car until you did, right?\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: Right. Okay. Bad idea, but anyway, go ahead.\nPlaintiff: So that's what you do, and you do get to the $1,500?\nJudge: Yes.\nPlaintiff: Okay, so, um, I had met up with his assistant, because that's who I was actually meeting up with. Like, although I talked to him, he was really not involved because I was talking to his assistant Dana. So she was the one that I was going through, so that's who I have the text messages with and all my emails.\nPlaintiff: So then the following two weeks, which was January 28th, I had met with her in the Barnes & Noble parking lot, which is usually where we meet. Like, we'll meet local because it was hard for me to get to him because he was such a distance.\nJudge: Okay, but don't keep digressing. So when did you have the $1,500 paid up?\nPlaintiff: January 28th.\nJudge: Okay. And then when do you go to pick out your new car?\nPlaintiff: Well, I looked for a new car before that date because I knew the date was coming.\nJudge: Yes.\nPlaintiff: Okay. So I already had my car picked out.\nJudge: Yes.\nPlaintiff: And I test drove the car, and that was actually with Scott, and we both discussed that this was the car that I planned on getting. And then the next two weeks, which was the 28th, I had planned that with Dana, and I gave her the rest of the money. So that was the $1,500.\nJudge: You know that there's $1,500 on your side, correct?\nDefendant: Your Honor, we don't know—I don't know sitting here today whether she came up with $1,350. I know I waited months and worked with her, holding cars to work.\nJudge: I have a simple question. What is the total amount she paid?\nDefendant: I do not know, your honor.\nJudge: You serious? Don't know?\nDefendant: That's right. She dealt with Dana. We were working with her for months.\nJudge: You talked to Dana before coming to court?\nDefendant: Months. I don’t think it doesn’t matter—\nJudge: You don’t have a method of keeping control of the money your place accepts?\nJudge: So, let’s focus. What happened with the Mazda? You have her money. She paid $1,500. She says she chose the Mazda, test drove it, and told you she wanted it.\nPlaintiff: Yes.\nJudge: What happened to the Mazda?\nDefendant: She didn’t close the deal fast enough. After holding the car for months, I had to sell it.\nPlaintiff: He never told me it was sold. I found out later through a text message.\nJudge: Did you sell the Mazda without informing her?\nDefendant: Yes, but I offered her to pick another car. I don’t offer refunds, only store credit.\nJudge: Store credit? She paid for a specific car. When were you going to tell her the car was sold?\nDefendant: I figured she’d choose another one. That’s how we work.\nJudge: You should have informed her right away when you sold the Mazda. It’s not about your policy—it’s about clarity and fairness.\nPlaintiff: I just want my deposit back. I don’t want another car from him.\nJudge: Understood. You handled this poorly, Mr. Geller. You owed her a heads-up and should have refunded the deposit when the car she paid for was sold.

Out of hospitality, I just, you know, I try to explain to them that it really takes me out of my way but, okay, I got to do it.\n\nJudge: All right, so you do it. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): So what happens is we’re going to the bus stop. The bus stop apparently—the bus leaves and I see the bus leaving, so we go to the next bus stop, which happens all the time, more or less. And I park three feet from the curb next to the—it’s a testing station for the water department. It’s actually like a fire hydrant, but a testing station. As he gets ready to get out of the vehicle, I see his foot going towards the door panel. As soon as I see the foot touch the door panel, I yelled at him, \"Watch my door!\"\n\nJudge: So he’s going to push the door open with his foot?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): So before I even finish the door sentence, it went bang.\n\nJudge: How open was the door when you heard \"bang\"?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): All the way. 'Cause if the hinge could’ve gone more, it would have. It went all the way, it just couldn’t go anymore, and apparently, that’s when it hit.\n\nJudge: Do you have a picture of the damage to the door?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Yes, I do, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Where is the damage on the door?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): In the middle of the door, in the tip of the edge.\n\nJudge: Where is it? Close to the edge by the hinge?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Okay, let me see.\n\nJudge: This is where the door opens?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. My confusion is—you're saying by the hinge, but if I’m sitting as a passenger in a car and I’m opening up the door, the open part is here. The hinge part is up front here. All right, and then it opens, opens, opens, opens, and then I walk out. Correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, where is the damage? Close to this part or close to the hinge? Those are two opposite parts.\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Close to that part where the door opens.\n\nJudge: So not close to the hinge, close to the opening part?\n\nPlaintiff (Leon): Okay.\n\nJudge: All right, what happened?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Your Honor, what he said so far, almost correctly, almost. But it happened on May 10th. It was on a Thursday. He pulled me up to the bus stop, as he says, we’re friends and whatnot. And I said goodbye to each other. Right when I went to open the door, I was like, \"Clank!\"\n\nJudge: What was that?\n\nDefendant (Robert): I looked down, and it was in front of door H. He parked actually three feet away from the fire hydrant. I’m like, \"What was that?\" Then he’s like cursing, whatever, blah blah blah. He—yeah, but why didn’t you see it? You’re the guy opening the door. Why weren’t you more careful?\n\nDefendant (Robert): He drives an SUV, and the fire hydrant was maybe about three feet up like this. I have a picture of the fire hydrant. Does anybody have a picture of the actual—?\n\nJudge: I appreciate that you took such a close-up for me to be able to see the detail of the damage. I would love to see it in perspective to the car if you have any more pictures. Don’t hide them now’s a really good time. I don’t know who you brought them for, if not me.\n\nDefendant (Robert): A repair door.\n\nJudge: Excellent. Oh, no, that’s fine. I don’t really care about the repaired door. This is a picture you’re showing, damage or no?\n\nDefendant (Robert): That’s the repaired door. There’s no damage on it.\n\nJudge: Okay, on all of these, it’s repaired.\n\nDefendant (Robert): Got it.\n\nJudge: Is this the thing that was hit, or is this the thing that was hit?\n\nDefendant (Robert): One is a little sort of like a pipe coming up that I guess is used. That’s where it hit. It’s the shorter of the two that it hit.\n\nJudge: Wait, what?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Here’s what I don’t understand. There’s that thing. There’s this thing, which is practically smacking you in the face. How do you not see it when you open the door?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Ma’am, I’m sorry.\n\nJudge: I mean, you’re the—let me ask you a question. When he came up to you and he said to you, \"I want you to pay for this damage,\" your answer was this: \"It’s not my fault. You’re the guy who pulled up here because your theory is you have eyeballs and you pulled up, so it’s your fault. Do you think it’s at all your fault?\"\n\nDefendant (Robert): That’s a tough one, but I’d say probably the driver for parking too close. Parking too close. Anybody think the passenger is responsible?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Yes, the passenger needs to watch where they’re opening the door.\n\nJudge: You think the passenger is responsible?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Yes, ditto.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Same thing he said. Responsible, you know. You have to be responsible for your own action. Fair enough.\n\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom, I take partial. I do take partial of it.\n\nDefendant (Robert): Well, you didn’t at the beginning.\n\nJudge: No, I did, ma’am.\n\nDefendant (Robert): No, you didn’t.\n\nJudge: At the beginning, you’re telling him, \"No, no, this is your fault.\" And then as a good—I'm going to quote you from your answer to the complaint: \"Because I’m a good Christian, I decided to offer him half.\" So you weren’t doing it because you felt you were culpable. You were doing it because you’re so incredibly magnanimous. That’s how your complaint, your answer to the complaint read. Am I wrong? Did you from the beginning say, \"Oh, I feel so bad, but you know, you pulled up, but I opened the door, maybe we should split it\"?\n\nDefendant (Robert): Yes. That’s what I said. I said to him, \"I’m sorry.\" That’s the first thing I said to him. First off, when that happened, he peeled off cursing. I didn’t—and this happened on Thursday. Friday I called out sick.\n\nJudge: Did you ever come out of the car and see the damage?\n\nDefendant (Robert): I was already hurt. I didn’t want to see no more hurt. So this is my—I’m sorry. So, um, um, I’m sorry. This happened on Thursday, right? I don’t see the gentleman until Monday. Now Monday morning, I see him. His exact words—word for word, he says: \"I said, I told him again, ‘Leon, I’m sorry for—you know, don’t worry about it, forget about it at the garage, because we pull out our trucks from the garage.’\"\n\nDefendant (Robert): So I said, \"I’m sorry, don’t worry about it.\" Now I get in my truck to start my truck up. He pulls—he comes over, walks over to my driver’s side. And, you know, we start talking. He’s like, \"Show me your license.\" We start laughing for what, three, four times? \"Show me your license.\" I’m not thinking, I gave him my wallet to show him my license. What he does, he pulls out his cell phone—clank! He takes a picture of my license.\n\nDefendant (Robert): Then he comes up, he goes, \"I said, first off, what’s that for?\" He goes, \"Uh, we have two choices: you could pay me $300 or we could go to court.\" Then that’s when I said, \"Your Honor, I’m not paying you nothing. Your fault. You should not pull up in front of the fire hydrant, three feet like that. Open the door, bang! What’s wrong with you?\" Then, Your Honor, during the day, I said, you know what, in my mind as I’m driving, yes, it’s his fault. But, like, and like you said, Your Honor, I should’ve looked when I got out.\n\nDefendant (Robert): So I took that into mind. At the end of the day, when I met him, I said, \"Leon, listen, I’ll give you $150.\" I never saw the bill. I never saw the damage. Let me see the bill. He peeled off. I never saw the damage of the bill. Monday morning comes, his car was already taken care of over the weekend. It was done, so I didn’t see nothing.\n\nJudge: Isn’t there something inside you that says, man, the guy was doing me a favor? The guy was dropping me off at the bus stop so I wouldn’t have to walk, but—and then not only that, that bus took off, so now he’s taking me to the next bus stop. Geez, like, regardless of what your legal obligation is, like why isn’t there like a little Christian thing inside you that said, that the guy was doing you the favor?\n\nDefendant (Robert): I don’t know. Just—I'm just pondering.\n\nJudge: Can I say something? So here’s a real question, okay? It’s a very simple case. What it’s about is whose fault is this? Is it—you say, well, it’s entirely his fault because he opened the door. And there’s a certain beauty to that theory. That’s your opinion. It’s okay. Yeah, it’s my fault, but it’s his fault too, Judge. So we need to split it. Why? 'Cause he’s the guy who pulled up to it. And there’s a certain beauty to that theory too.\n\nJudge: However, when I look at this and I look at the pictures of the damage and where the damage is at the door, you could have not hit that item for a long way. You know, there’s many, many ways to open the door. One of them is your hands still on the door and then you get out. I realize you’re a big guy, but that way wouldn’t have hit.\n\nJudge: He didn’t pull up an inch from the thing. He pulled up in a way that a human being could get out. It’s just not the way that human being got out. So I am going to find you totally liable for the full amount, not half and half, and order you to pay the plaintiff the $364.71.

{"id": "898", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says he booked a recording session at the defendant's studio, but he broke his leg, and the defendant won't let him reschedule. The defendant says that the plaintiff was a no-show for his session. He never called to reschedule, and he sat there wasting time when he could have been using his studio for another client. It's the case of a leg up. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nBailiff: You're welcome.\n\nJudge: All right, Mr. Francis, you are suing Mr. Irvin's company because you want a deposit that you gave them refunded to you. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, my best friend Quasa passed away, and she was a very big supporter of my music. So I wanted to go in and do something for her. So I called Mr. Irvin, and I booked—well, first, I inquired how much two hours would be. He told me $50. So I immediately sent a Cash App payment of $40 just to show that I was serious and I was, you know, trying to do this.\n\nJudge: Did he ask you for a deposit?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he just informed me of what his prices would be.\n\nJudge: Did you schedule a date?\n\nPlaintiff: No, at no point in time was a date actually scheduled. That was an issue. He did ask me to schedule a date, but I have the text where I stated that I didn't necessarily want to book a time at the moment because I had some engagements.\n\nJudge: So why are you just price-checking and then giving him money? What's the point of giving him money if you're not trying to reserve a date?\n\nPlaintiff: For me to be financially responsible, I needed to put a deposit down when I had it, because I'm not the most financially responsible person.\n\nJudge: You need to get better at that. It's kind of silly to put a deposit down if you don’t even have a date. You just have to have better willpower than that. Put it in a drawer and close the drawer. Just get better. Be better at adulting.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: All right, so you give the $40, and then what happens on March 39th?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, there's no March 39th.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: I mean March 29th. Sorry.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, because I sent the deposit on March 29th, and on March 31st, we did set a tentative date for April 1st. But when I contacted him on April 1st, I was told that he left his phone at a friend’s house and that he wouldn’t have it for five days.\n\nJudge: What does his phone have to do with anything?\n\nPlaintiff: Because that’s how I was contacting him. I was texting him.\n\nJudge: When you say you set a tentative date for April 1st, why didn’t you just show up?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, we didn’t necessarily set a time.\n\nJudge: So you didn’t show up on April 1st?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t, because we never set a time.\n\nJudge: Did you set another date then?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I called him on April 1st, but he told me that his phone would be incapacitated for five days. So it was going to be hard to reach him for that time.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: After that, he contacted me on April 2nd. I didn’t have the $10 balance, and I told him it would be about a week until I could have it. That was agreed upon. On April 7th, I got hit by a car. My leg was fractured. I was in the hospital for 24 hours. When I got out the next day, April 8th, I contacted him because I knew at that point I would not be able to book the time. I sent him a text about my situation.\n\nJudge: Is there any paperwork between the two of you, or was everything verbal?\n\nPlaintiff: Everything was verbal.\n\nJudge: What would give you the impression that a deposit you put down would be refundable?\n\nPlaintiff: Just because there was no contract and there was nothing told to me that if anything was to happen, I wouldn’t be able to get it back. These situations were out of my control. It wasn’t like I planned on getting hit by a car.\n\nJudge: Let me hear from you, Mr. Irvin.\n\nDefendant: What he’s saying is not true at all. It started on March 28th. He initially came to my home, not a phone call. He was in my home, and I was recording a song myself. He heard it and said he’d been trying to book studio time with me for years, but every time he tried, he no-showed, just like now.\n\nJudge: Okay, I see a text from March 29th where he says, \"I'm thinking I'll need time to prep, so 3 PM Thursday evening, right?\" Then he says, \"I got hit by a car last week, so won’t be able to record for a minute, sadly. Want to discuss deposit. Would you be able to refund it? Let me know.\" You responded that deposits are non-refundable.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: But your policy states you keep 50%. That means he should get $15 back. Why wouldn’t you return the extra $15?\n\nDefendant: I was talking to my partner about it.\n\nJudge: What did your partner say?\n\nDefendant: My partner said to give him back the $15.\n\nJudge: So why am I here, Mr. Irvin? Why didn’t you just send him the $15?\n\nDefendant: He served me with paperwork before I could.\n\nJudge: You could’ve just sent him the money and avoided this. I am ordering you to pay him the $15. Case closed.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Good luck to both of you.\n\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting , Deflection "}

{"id": "795", "dialogue": "Plaintiff: I rented some commercial space to the defendant, who opened a hair salon. Almost immediately, the cops were called due to marijuana odors emanating from the place. I filed for an eviction, and the defendant trashed the place before vacating. I'm suing for $3,220.74 for damages, rent, and attorney’s fees.\n\nNarrator: This is the defendant, Ashley Packard. She says everything was fine for the first year, but a new tenant moved in upstairs, and that’s when the problems started. She says the plaintiff started harassing her workers and clients, so she moved out, left the sinks and chairs because they belonged to the place, put her trash on the street, and is now being sued.\n\nJudge: All parties, please raise your right hand.\n\nNarrator: Welcome back to The People's Court. The plaintiff rented commercial space to the defendant, who opened a hair salon. The plaintiff says the defendant was heavy into weed and trashed the place, but the defendant claims the problems were caused by another tenant. It’s the case of the salon that gave everyone a buzz.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. A68 LLC, represented by Ms. Drab, you’re the owner?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You’re suing Ashley Packard for $3,220.74 in rent and utilities because, according to you, she violated a stipulation the two of you had entered into in landlord-tenant court. You own a piece of property that is a salon?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And when did you start renting it?\n\nPlaintiff: In December.\n\nJudge: How long was she there in total?\n\nPlaintiff: A year and a half.\n\nJudge: And what went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason we're here is that she did not meet the stipulations of the agreement.\n\nJudge: How did you end up in landlord-tenant court? What was the first thing that went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: The rent was not paid for July and August.\n\nJudge: July and August of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2018.\n\nJudge: Did you pay July and August?\n\nDefendant: No, because I received a notice to quit.\n\nJudge: Were you in the middle of a lease?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So she stops paying rent. Why did you give her a notice to quit? Had you received complaints?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason was that she was constantly late with rent. Also, the electricity had to be paid, and sometimes she would pay it late. There were also other reasons—I spoke to her about bringing in people to do acrylic nails, and the fumes were offensive. The lady upstairs complained, and I spoke with her about installing a ventilation system, which never happened.\n\nJudge: What was the deal with the nail technicians?\n\nDefendant: My girls, who worked with me, could be a little mouthy, but they stood their ground.\n\nJudge: What were they standing their ground about?\n\nDefendant: Gina tried to get a hold of me one day, but I was at a class. My workers told me she came in, screaming at them to stop what they were doing, demanded to call me, threw her purse down, and started going through my drawers and the salon.\n\nJudge: Did they record her?\n\nDefendant: No, they were in the middle of doing nails.\n\nJudge: In this day and age where everyone records everything, there's no video?\n\nDefendant: No, but they told me what happened.\n\nJudge: So, there was no rent paid in July or August. You file for eviction and end up in landlord-tenant court. There was a stipulation that the defendant agreed to pay $1,665.28 by September 5th. Did you make that payment?\n\nDefendant: Yes, and I have proof.\n\nJudge: How did you make the payment?\n\nDefendant: By check.\n\nJudge: Did you mail it or deliver it?\n\nDefendant: I drove to her house and put it in her mailbox.\n\nJudge: Is this your mailbox?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: That picture is dated September 5th at 10:00 PM. Technically, she complied, even if you didn't see it until the 6th.\n\nPlaintiff: But she didn't remove all her belongings or leave the premises broom-clean.\n\nJudge: What did she leave behind?\n\nPlaintiff: There was trash everywhere. She left a chair outside, garbage in the sinks, alcohol bottles, clutter, nail polish, and stuff in the back room and stair landing. The city wouldn't pick up the garbage, and I had to make private arrangements.\n\nJudge: Did you notify her?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but she never responded.\n\nJudge: Why did you leave all the trash behind?\n\nDefendant: That’s where we always put trash.\n\nJudge: That’s where you put one bag of trash on trash day, not an entire pile. She could get fined.\n\nDefendant: I had no one to help me move.\n\nJudge: That’s a you problem, not a her problem. If the deal was two months of free rent only if you left the place clean, and you didn’t, she can sue you for that rent.\n\nDefendant: I understand.\n\nJudge: What’s this black thing in the picture?\n\nPlaintiff: It's a pile of garbage.\n\nJudge: You know you’re under scrutiny in court. Why not just take the trash to the dump? Instead, you left it there and created this issue. Now she’s suing you for July and August rent because she says you violated the stipulation.\n\nJudge: You had a good deal—you didn’t have to pay July or August rent, just leave the place clean. Instead, you left it a mess. If I were you, I’d make sure the place was spotless to avoid being sued.\n\nDefendant: I understand.\n\nJudge: Do you think the landlord has the right to sue for two months' rent?\n\nAudience Member: Yes, because the defendant didn’t fulfill her part of the agreement.\n\nJudge: Agreed. Going back inside the courtroom.\n\nJudge: There’s alcohol left behind? What kind?\n\nPlaintiff: A bottle of wine.\n\nJudge: Clutter in the back room, nail polish in a small room, and leftover pedicure supplies. She didn’t clean up.\n\nJudge: Ms. Packard, you were given a deal, and you didn’t hold up your end. I find in favor of the plaintiff for $3,220.74.\n\nJudge: Judgment for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "Gaslighting,Deflection,playing the victim"}
{"id": "471", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties ready?\n\nJudge: Mark, you’ve asked to be referred to only by your first name?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You are suing Rob. Okay, let’s get this straight—you own a company that does what?\n\nPlaintiff: I own a dueling pianos company. We provide rock-and-roll live entertainment for bars and restaurants all throughout the country.\n\nJudge: Do you actually play?\n\nPlaintiff: I am not just the president, I’m also a performer.\n\nJudge: And then there’s another—so you bring in two pianos?\n\nPlaintiff: We bring in two keyboards or pianos, two of our roster of over 30 different performers. We do a three-hour non-stop show that’s all-request—from Billy Joel to Bon Jovi, Britney Spears, Bruno Mars, Snoop Dogg, AC/DC. People sing, they drink, they dance—it’s three hours straight every night.\n\nJudge: Oh, God, I love it. All right. Now, you—what is your job?\n\nDefendant: I’m the general manager of the Park Tap Grill.\n\nJudge: Okay, now, you have done business with him many, many times at different venues, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, probably four or five different venues over eight years.\n\nJudge: Okay, and so you hire him to do work at this venue?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you enter into a written contract? Does anybody have a copy of that written contract?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and that written contract covers three months of performances? Was it one time a week?\n\nPlaintiff: One time a month.\n\nDefendant: Four months, one time per month.\n\nJudge: Okay, is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, four times, once a month. And how was it going when he would come in?\n\nDefendant: Not great.\n\nJudge: Not great. And do you think that was their fault?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Because you keep hiring them. Do you think it just wasn’t working out, wasn’t what that audience wanted?\n\nDefendant: Yeah, and in this line, you have to give it a few times to build momentum. You know, you never hit a home run right out of the park the first time.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: But, you know, you build that repetition, always building it up, building it up. And then—it just wasn’t building.\n\nJudge: Okay, so what happens is you perform in the four months of the contract, which are January through April. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: At the end of the four-month term, we checked back with Rob to see if he wanted to do another date. He had told us verbally he wanted to add a show for May. We emailed him as per paragraph 7 in the contract, requesting written confirmation, which I also have, and he confirmed.\n\nJudge: Let me see that, please.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, he wanted us to come in May—he wanted to do one more Thursday in May. So we had that written confirmation, which then comports that date to the rest of the contract.\n\nJudge: What happened in May?\n\nPlaintiff: The day of the show, we got a message that morning that said, and I’m quoting, “We won’t have anyone there to justify having the show,” and he canceled the show because it was raining. He said, “The weather is supposed to be bad all day. I don’t see the point of the show tonight.” And then he went on to say, “Cancel the show, and you can bill me.”\n\nJudge: Let me see that, highlighted in blue.\n\nPlaintiff: And again, as the defendant stated, we’ve done business together for many years, in many different venues. He was well acquainted with our practices and our policies.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant: Like I said, the show wasn’t going well, and the weather was horrible that week. We had been checking the weather back and forth, not just that day, but prior to that as well. I pulled a report from the weather at Lyen Airport, which is about 20 miles away. We had a half-inch of rain coming down the night of the show.\n\nJudge: The question is—do you have to pay them? That’s the question.\n\nDefendant: If we ended up paying him, and I had made him come down, drive an hour, set up, and sit in the corner playing for three hours by himself—\n\nJudge: Right. But we do know when you guys had a written contract for those prior months, it specifically said all performance dates are guaranteed to occur and cannot be canceled by the purchaser for any reason.\n\nJudge: Furthermore, it says all future performance dates—once confirmed in writing, which it was because you sent an email confirming it—are guaranteed to occur and cannot be canceled. The terms of this agreement are clear: if you want to cancel, you have to pay.\n\nJudge: Why shouldn’t they have to pay him?\n\nDefendant: Well, it was mutual—\n\nJudge: Mutual? He’s already hired two people, he’s planning to go, and you’re making him lose $800. How is that mutual?\n\nDefendant: Well, at the same time, I’d rather not lose the money if he came down, spent money, and played for no one.\n\nJudge: But you had a contract. An oral contract is still a contract. And you breached it.\n\nJudge: You said “Bill me.” Where I come from, “Bill me” means “Bill me.” It doesn’t mean, “Oh, I saved you a trip, so you’re going to eat this.”\n\nJudge: I’m ordering them to pay you the $800, plus prejudgment interest since May 17th.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Court is adjourned.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, deflection, gaslighting"}

Next case on the docket, the plaintiff went to a steakhouse, valeted her car, and then, when she walked out and left, realized her computer was missing. But the defendant says she's such a scammer she said 35 softball uniforms were stolen, changed to an iPod, and on and on. It's the case of 'I have beef with a valet.'\n\nJudge: Thank you. Jessica Wolf, yes? You are suing the valet company represented here by Andres Bazan. Are you the owner, the manager?\n\nDefendant: I'm supervising Westchester County accounts of the company.\n\nJudge: Okay.

You are suing for $3,880 in items that you say the company stole from you when they valeted your car. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: I went to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on Saturday, November 26th. Earlier that day, I was at the library studying.\n\nJudge: What library?\n\nPlaintiff: The Orangeburg Library in Rockland County.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I had my laptop, a calculator, and study books and materials in a black tote bag. So I studied, got into the car, and put the laptop down. Later that night—\n\nJudge: Where did you put the laptop?\n\nPlaintiff: On the passenger seat of the car.\n\nJudge: Where did you put the rest of the stuff you described?\n\nPlaintiff: It was in the bag. Everything was in the bag, and I put it on the passenger seat.\n\nPlaintiff: Later that night, we decided to go to Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse for dinner. We had reservations around 8 or 8:30.\n\nJudge: Who is “we”?\n\nPlaintiff: Me and my family.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I picked up my brother, who got into the car. The bag was on the passenger seat. He moved the bag to the back seat of the car.\n\nJudge: Okay. What about the computer?\n\nPlaintiff: Everything was in the bag. It was a black tote bag, and it had everything in it. He moved it to the back seat of the car.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: We got to the restaurant. I was a little hesitant. I saw the valet. I really didn’t want to valet my car—not because I was thinking about stolen items, but because of scratches and things like that.\n\nJudge: What kind of car do you drive?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s a BMW 3 Series.\n\nJudge: What year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2011.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you pulled up, not realizing that you had the laptop in the back of the car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. My brother had just moved it when he got in the car.\n\nJudge: Okay, but your memory didn’t last from then?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I handed the valet my keys, and he gave me the ticket. We went into the restaurant. Everything was fine. We came back out. I handed the valet my ticket. He ran and got the car.\n\nPlaintiff: My brother noticed that the car was parked way in the back, in a secluded area near the woods. It was a little strange.\n\nJudge: How did you notice that it was parked in a secluded area far away?\n\nPlaintiff: There were no other cars around the vicinity.\n\nJudge: Did you stay late? Maybe that’s why there were no other cars.\n\nPlaintiff: No, there were still many people left in the restaurant.\n\nJudge: Okay. But their cars weren’t there?\n\nPlaintiff: No. The car was parked in the last row of the parking lot where the valet parks the cars. There were dozens of open spots closer to the restaurant.\n\nJudge: Did that strike you as strange at the time?\n\nPlaintiff: Not immediately. But when we found out what was missing, I put two and two together.\n\nJudge: So you got your car and didn’t check your stuff?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: You didn’t notice anything missing until the next day?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I didn’t even think someone would steal my laptop. The car interior is black, the bag is black, and it was late at night. It just didn’t occur to me.\n\nJudge: You’re claiming $4,000 worth of stuff was missing, but you didn’t check before leaving the lot?\n\nPlaintiff: No. I parked my car in the driveway, and it automatically locks. The next morning, when I went to study, I noticed the bag was missing. That’s when I called the restaurant and reported the theft.\n\nDefendant: Her father actually called, not her. We checked with our employees, and they said they didn’t touch anything. We’ve had no prior complaints about them.\n\nJudge: Do you ever do polygraphs?\n\nDefendant: Sometimes, but not in this case. The claim seemed odd—44 items missing. The ticket also clearly states we are not responsible for valuables left in the car.\n\nJudge: Ms. Wolf, you have no direct proof the valet stole your items, and you didn’t check your belongings before leaving.

{"id": "728", "dialogue": "Judge: Armand Beaudette, you are suing Emily Abel for $935 for October and November rent plus a late fee. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: A year ago, I entered into a verbal agreement with my granddaughter, who is Emily's girlfriend, and Emily. We agreed on a $900 a month rent, each paying $450. I would pay for the heat and hot water. The rent was reduced by $300 from previous leases to help my granddaughter pay her student loans and help Emily save some money. The apartment was across the street from our home, providing a safe environment for both of them.\n\nJudge: Did you know Emily before this?\n\nPlaintiff: I knew her through my granddaughter. They were close friends.\n\nJudge: So she wasn't a stranger to you.\n\nPlaintiff: No, not at all.\n\nJudge: When did they move in?\n\nPlaintiff: January 2016.\n\nJudge: And how was the rent payment situation?\n\nPlaintiff: Emily would sometimes pay in installments or be late, but we let it go because it helped both of them. On August 31st, the defendant failed to pay for the month of August and disappeared. I tried contacting her, texting and calling, but she wouldn't answer.\n\nJudge: When did she pay for August?\n\nPlaintiff: Early September. She showed up and paid.\n\nJudge: Emily, where were you in August?\n\nDefendant: I was staying with my boyfriend.\n\nJudge: So you paid for August. What about September?\n\nPlaintiff: She paid for August and through the end of September. Then we reached October.\n\nJudge: Emily, did you tell anyone you were moving out?\n\nDefendant: I told Kayla, the plaintiff's granddaughter, that I was planning to move out to give her time to find another roommate.\n\nJudge: But did you inform the landlord?\n\nDefendant: I thought telling Kayla was enough.\n\nJudge: That's not how it works. You have to formally notify the landlord.\n\nDefendant: I understand.\n\nJudge: So what is your defense for not paying October rent?\n\nDefendant: I planned to pay October's rent, but when I went to get my things, the locks were changed.\n\nJudge: When did you go get your things?\n\nDefendant: The last day of October.\n\nJudge: How does that indicate you were going to pay rent?\n\nDefendant: I wasn't trying to ruin my relationship with my friend.\n\nJudge: Did it get ruined?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: If you didn't notify the landlord and didn't pay October rent, whose fault is it that the friendship went south?\n\nDefendant: I understand it's my fault.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, who changed the locks?\n\nPlaintiff: I did. My granddaughter felt unsafe because Emily disappeared. We changed the locks, but I texted Emily.\n\nJudge: That's illegal. You can't change the locks.\n\nPlaintiff: I understand.\n\nJudge: Emily, how did you get your things?\n\nDefendant: I argued with Kayla, and she unlocked the door for me.\n\nJudge: So you got your things and suffered no damages. But you feel you shouldn't pay October rent because the locks were changed at the end of the month?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: The law doesn't work that way. But I agree you don't owe November rent since the lockout happened. Now, where is the $35 late fee from?\n\nPlaintiff: I charged it to encourage timely payments. I have a receipt showing it.\n\nJudge: Did Emily ever pay a late fee before?\n\nDefendant: Not that I recall.\n\nPlaintiff: Here's a receipt showing a $20 late fee paid in February.\n\nJudge: Emily, do you remember paying this?\n\nDefendant: I guess so.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff, did you charge a late fee in September?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I let it slide.\n\nJudge: I will order Emily to pay $450 for October rent plus a $20 late fee, totaling $470.

He said if I fronted the money, he would pay me back when he got the job.\nJudge: And did he get hired?\nPlaintiff (Norberto Valz): No, because my boss didn't hire him. He said he needed to pay child support, and that turned my boss off.\nJudge: Why?\nPlaintiff (Norberto Valz): Because he was behind on child support.\nJudge: How far behind?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): Not behind, I wasn’t on child support yet.\nJudge: So why did you mention it?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): I said it because I was about to be put on it.\nJudge: But you're paying money to your baby mom, right?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): Yes.\nJudge: But you're not paying child support.\nDefendant (Mark Quana): No.\nJudge: Why don’t you have a driver’s license?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): I have a bad driving record.\nJudge: How bad?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): I had 18 points in less than three months.\nJudge: You must have ignored the summons or didn’t pay the tickets.\nDefendant (Mark Quana): Yes, that's about right.\nJudge: How do you get 18 points?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): By being irresponsible.\nJudge: You’re still working, though.\nDefendant (Mark Quana): Yes, for a pool company my family owns.\nJudge: Do you drive?\nDefendant (Mark Quana): No, I get picked up.\nJudge: So, you didn't get hired.\nPlaintiff (Norberto Valz): He didn’t get hired, and he didn’t pay me back.\nJudge: But then you continue to loan him more money.\nPlaintiff (Norberto Valz): Yes, because he promised to pay me back once he started working.\nJudge: But he didn’t pay you back the last time.

{"id": "961", "dialogue": "**Full Courtroom Transcript:**\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** These are the plaintiffs, Tony and Kathy. Tony says he was walking Kathy's dog, and when he passed by the defendant's house, her rather large Alaskan Malamute charged towards them and attacked Kathy's dog, Pepper. Kathy's dog needed nine stitches to repair the damage the defendant's dog caused. She's a terrible person who never had the decency to even respond to their request for vet payment, and they’re suing her here and now for the $1,364.44 they most definitely owe.\n\n**Defendant (Deborah Pelts):** This is the defendant, Deborah Pelts. She says it was the plaintiff’s dog that snapped at her dog first, and that caused the fight to ensue. Her dog, Diesel, reacted as dogs will—he defended himself. And she owes nothing because dogs will be dogs.\n\nShe’s accused of failing to control her big old dog.\n\n**Judge:** All parties please rise. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff's dog passed the defendant's house, and the defendant’s Alaskan Malamute viciously attacked. But the defendant says the plaintiff's dog snapped first. It’s the case of \"Your Malamute is Muy Mal.\"\n\nThank you, Douglas.\n\nOkay, Kathy and Tony, you've asked to be referred to only by your first names. You are suing Deborah Pelts for $1,364.44 in damages that you say you incurred as a result of a dog bite.\n\nTell me, your dog was on a leash, I presume?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Just bring your dog out so I can see your dog. If you’re going to bring the dog, I might as well see the dog.\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Hi. All right.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Mix?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** All right.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so what happened?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** It was after dinner, I was taking the dog for a walk. Kathy had been away, I was watching her for a few days.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And is it technically Kathy’s dog?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Yeah, it's Kathy’s dog.\n\n**Judge:** Do you both live together?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** No.\n\n**Judge:** No. So the dog you were...\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Yeah, I was watching the dog for a few days. She was up visiting her new grandson.\n\nAnyway, I walked down Ryerson, which is near my apartment where I lived at the time, and when I approached Park Street, which is where the defendant lives, I turned the corner and there was a car parked on the side of the road. I was walking—I was going to go around it—but there was a car coming down the street. So I waited behind that car, and as the car went by, behind the street, I could see the defendants talking to each other. She was on the porch, and he was on the lawn.\n\nThe next thing I know, their dog came out of the back door, which was next to her.\n\n**Judge:** What kind of dog was that? What kind of dog is your dog?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Malamute-Shepherd mix.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Big dog?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Big dog. And anyway, the dog just walked slowly across the street. I’m standing there with Pepper. As it got closer, I was trying to move her away, and then as soon as they got close, that Malamute started biting her. That’s when I tried to push it away with my leg.\n\nThen Pepper—because she was so much smaller—had to get up to defend herself. When she did, the Malamute put her paws up, and then bit her in the stomach.\n\nWhen they really started to bite each other, I pulled Pepper, and she came off her collar. She ran about 10 feet away, and then the defendant got control of her dog.\n\nThe whole time she’s saying, \"No, my dog never gets loose. It never gets off the leash,\" and so forth. But in the meantime, this confrontation was occurring, and they had time to grab it, but they didn’t until after.\n\n**Judge:** What were they doing while you were struggling with the dog? What were the two of them doing?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** I think they were astonished at what was happening. More or less, they were astonished at how the dog got out.\n\n**Judge:** So there’s no fenced-in yard?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** No, it’s just open.\n\n**Judge:** So the dog comes out—\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** The door must have been ajar.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. And the dog came out and just walked across the street and attacked Pepper?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Yes. I was yelling, \"Get control of your dog!\"\n\n**Judge:** When you said you kicked the dog, did you actually kick the dog? Did you lift your leg? What did you do?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** I was holding Pepper with the leash, and as the dog was starting to bite her, I kicked her with my leg.\n\n**Judge:** Did she or he say anything?\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** After I got Pepper—after she came off the collar and I was walking away—I said, \"I guess dogs will just be dogs,\" because it didn’t seem like anybody was hurt.\n\nAnd he said, \"If you ever kick my dog again, I’ll kick your—\"\n\nIf he hadn’t said that, I probably would have knocked on their door the next day to tell them that there was an injury caused.\n\nBut when I went to file the next day at the police department, I described where I was and who was involved, and the cop said, \"They know him, and he runs hot.\"\n\n**Defendant (Deborah Pelts):** That’s not what happened at all. My dog never gets out. Diesel is always on a leash, and I was right there on the porch. The dog was inside. I think Tony’s dog actually provoked Diesel. He’s protective, but he doesn’t just attack.\n\n**Judge:** Did you see the fight start?\n\n**Defendant (Deborah Pelts):** No, I was on the porch, but by the time I looked up, they were already tangled. I ran down immediately.\n\n**Judge:** Who got your dog under control?\n\n**Defendant (Deborah Pelts):** My partner grabbed him, but it was only a few seconds. This was not a vicious attack.\n\n**Judge:** I have the vet bills here, and the wounds on Pepper indicate deep punctures. That suggests a bite force beyond just a scuffle.\n\n**Plaintiff (Tony):** Exactly. That’s why we’re here. The vet said it was a serious bite.\n\n**Judge:** Based on the evidence, I find in favor of the plaintiffs for the full amount of $1,364.44. The defendant’s dog was not properly restrained, and the responsibility falls on her.\n\n**Defendant (Deborah Pelts):** That’s not fair.\n\n**Judge:** That’s my ruling.

Okay, and you are suing Manuel Bermudez for $5,000 that you say he owes you in legal fees, lost wages, and more. Lost wages? Okay, talk to me. What's going on here?\n\nPlaintiff: This is my ex-boyfriend. Okay? And, um, I had sued him in small claims court, and I had—\n\nJudge: How long did you two date?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, for three years.\n\nJudge: Okay, and were you living together?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, and why did you folks break up?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, basically, he cheated.\n\nJudge: How did you find out?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, sorry, I didn't really want to have to go into all this stuff, but basically, he told me.\n\nJudge: Oh, he came clean? Or did you catch him and then he came clean?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, a hurricane came, um, and we were getting ready to leave, you know, to evacuate as it was required. And I asked him if he was going to come with me, and he said no. And then that's when he revealed that he was going to be evacuating with some girl that he'd been cheating on me with.\n\nJudge: Wow. Okay, wait a minute. So you were living together, and then you're like, \"All right, so come on,\" and he's like, \"Nah, pass, I'm going to go with somebody else.\" That's how you found out? In the middle of a hurricane, no less?\n\nPlaintiff: No, at that moment, we were not living together, but we were still somewhat of a couple. And anyway, yeah, so that happened.\n\nJudge: Okay. So I take it that was painful?\n\nPlaintiff: Mhm.\n\nJudge: Tell me about your lawsuit, then. What is it you're trying to collect legal fees for?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so I had sued him in small claims court for $5,000.\n\nJudge: For what, though? For what?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, um, for half of our pet expenses.\n\nJudge: Pet expenses? Okay. How many pets did you guys have?\n\nPlaintiff: I have four cats now.\n\nJudge: \"We have four cats.\" Okay, we don't have anything, because you guys broke up five months ago. But did you actually have a trial on that case, or did you fail to appear?\n\nPlaintiff: No, we had a trial.\n\nJudge: And was he there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you won?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. And a judge gave you a judgment?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And did the judgment include attorney's fees?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you ask for attorney's fees?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, basically what she had said is the lawyer had to represent me on that case for her to include them.\n\nJudge: So then what makes you think the result would be different now?\n\nPlaintiff: I have no idea what I'm doing.\n\nJudge: That's fine, that's fine. You're not a lawyer, I get it. So what attorney's fees did you incur that you are suing for here today?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, in order to get the money back that I had won, I had to hire attorneys to try to figure out how to get the money in post-judgment collections. Um, I don't know if you're familiar—\n\nJudge: And may I see the receipt for those lawyers? Did you end up getting any money in post-judgment collections?\n\nPlaintiff: I haven't gotten a cent yet.\n\nJudge: Okay. And let me also—does that have the judgment also?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, the judgment? Yeah, I'll be needing the judgment.\n\nJudge: You're on a monthly legal plan?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I am.\n\nJudge: When did you decide to go on a monthly legal plan?\n\nPlaintiff: When I figured out he wasn't going to pay me the money back.\n\n[Full transcript continues, including statements from Defendant, further questioning by the Judge, and courtroom analysis.]\n\n...\n\nJudge: What I'm going to do as to these legal fees is I'm going to dismiss this part of your lawsuit without prejudice to you raising it again if and when you win the restraining order case. All right?\n\nJudge: As for the lost wages for civil suits—tell me how on Earth you lost wages. You're a teacher. You're working every day. You're not taking time off to do this, are you?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought this was a sport on your off time.\n\nJudge: No, um, of course, they have to take the day off to go to court because the court date and time is during a school day.\n\nJudge: Okay. How are you going to prove that you have $2,000 of lost wages?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. Do you want to see the receipts?\n\n...\n\nJudge: I'm ruling against you on lost wages. Now, let's talk about the legal fees. I'm finding in her favor in the amount of the legal fees that it took to take the money that you had in the account but weren't paying her, and that's in the amount of $645.\n\n...\n\nJudge: Good luck to both of you.

{"id": "142", "dialogue": "Judge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case in the docket: the plaintiff bought a car, turns out the defendant, he says, didn’t disclose the car was in a bad accident and had airbag problems. But the defendant says the plaintiff went in with eyes wide open. It’s the case of a crash course in buying cars.\n\nJudge: Okay, John, you are suing Alexander and Mark, and your mom—your wife—who not only doesn’t want her last name mentioned, she doesn’t want to be here and gave you power of attorney. All right, you're suing that side for $3,472.38 that you say you are due from them for repairs for a car they sold you that apparently had more problems than you bargained for. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Correct. I located the ad on eBay. I liked the car. I contacted the seller.\n\nJudge: Who was the seller?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, Alex.\n\nJudge: Okay. Alex is the son?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and was your name the only name on the car? Were all three names on the car?\n\nDefendant (Alex): It was my dad’s name on the car.\n\nJudge: Just the dad’s name on the car. Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: We discussed the purchase of the car. We discussed the lien amount on the car, and if I liked the car, I'd come down with the check to satisfy the lien and I would drive it home the same day.\n\nJudge: Okay. How much is the lien?\n\nPlaintiff: Fifteen thousand and change.\n\nJudge: Okay, so you sold the car to him for fifteen thousand?\n\nDefendant (Mark): Sixteen five, I believe it was.\n\nJudge: That sound right?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s about right.\n\nJudge: Okay, so go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I immediately noticed some things that weren’t mentioned in the eBay ad. Bald tires in the back, the shifter was worn out.\n\nJudge: This is before you bought it?\n\nPlaintiff: Right, before I bought it. So I noticed a couple of things when I looked at the car, test drove it for a short test drive, and I liked the car. So we negotiated a price and we settled on a price.\n\nJudge: Okay, and you buy?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, did you have it seen by a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I looked at it myself.\n\nJudge: Okay. Are you a mechanic?\n\nPlaintiff: I’ve been working on cars for a long time.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right, so then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, well, during the course of my looking at the car, Alex did tell me that the car was in an accident. It was in the front passenger side. And so I paid specific attention to that and looked, checked it over. The car looked like it was in pretty good shape.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And so I settled and bought the car. Drove it home.\n\nJudge: So why are you suing them?\nPlaintiff: Lots of problems. On the drive home, the check engine light came on. That was the first thing. Well, actually, when I looked at the car, the airbag light was on. I asked Alex what was going on with the airbag light. He told me that he brought it to a shop and they couldn’t tell what was wrong with it. I had to take it to the dealer. And since the car had an extended warranty, I assumed that the car—whatever damage to the airbag system or malfunctioning—would be covered under warranty.\n\nJudge: Did you check that before you bought the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I didn’t.\n\nJudge: Okay.\nJudge: I have reviewed all the facts of this case, and based on the evidence presented, I find in favor of the defendants. This was an as-is sale, and there is no proof of deliberate deception. The plaintiff assumed certain things about the vehicle and did not conduct a full inspection before purchase. That is not on the defendants.\n\nPlaintiff: But Your Honor, I believe the insurance company should have caught this issue. I tried to reach out to Alex to contact Geico, but I never got a response.\n\nJudge: That may be an issue with your insurance company, but it does not place liability on the defendants. They did not conceal information, and they disclosed the previous accident. You even saw the airbag light on before you bought the car.

And you broke up when?\n\nPlaintiff:\nLast year, in September.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And after the breakup, he gives you a car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe gave me the car before, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And when did he give you the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe gave me the car in 2016. I’ve had the car since then.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you’ve been driving it all that time?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. When you broke up, did you leave with the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nHad the car been in his name the whole time?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you left with the car, what did he tell you?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me to pay the insurance for the car and to register the car. I did not because I had been shopping around for insurance. The agreement the defendant and I made was that until July of 2018, the car would stay in his name.\n\nJudge:\nUntil July of 2018, it would stay in his name?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nDid he sign the title over to you?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, but after we broke up.\n\nJudge:\nWhen?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOctober of 2017.\n\nJudge:\nNow, your version of this is very different. You told her to take your plates off, return your plates, and register the car?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd she didn’t?\n\nDefendant:\nOf course not.\n\nJudge:\nWho was paying for the insurance on the car?\n\nDefendant:\nI was, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nSo you had insurance on the car, but she never registered it in her name?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, I did not, because I finally got insurance—\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you get insurance?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI got insurance in August. I was quoted $227.\n\nJudge:\nWait, did you have the insurance, or did he have the insurance?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe had the insurance on this car.\n\nJudge:\nSo he had the insurance in his name?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo you were shopping around but never bought insurance?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nThen what were you saying about $227 and getting insurance in August? You didn’t get insurance.\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, because the deal Mr. Samuel and I had was for me to pay the insurance until the end of July. By the end of July, I would then give him the plates for the car, and I would take over the insurance, have the car registered, and have everything in my name.\n\nJudge:\nAnd according to you, Mr. Samuel, what was the agreement?\n\nDefendant:\nThe agreement was that she was supposed to take the title, go to the DMV, get the car in her name so I could get it off of me. Because we were no longer in a relationship, I didn’t want that car in my name.\n\nJudge:\nWhy are you giving your ex-girlfriend a car anyway?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause she had been using the car while we were together, and we had a business together. She needed the car to move from her new home to the business, so I gave it to her for that purpose.\n\nJudge:\nWhat was the business you two had together?\n\nDefendant:\nWe had an Airbnb business.\n\nJudge:\nWhere?\n\nDefendant:\nAt my house.\n\nJudge:\nSo, according to you, you gave her the car as a gift but on the condition that she registered it in her own name. She didn’t do that, and now there’s an accident?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhen was the accident?\n\nPlaintiff:\nFather’s Day of this year.\n\nJudge:\nSo, months after he gave you the car. And when was the car struck?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAt 4:30 in the morning.\n\nJudge:\nWhat were you doing out at 4:30 in the morning?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt was parked in front of my residence.\n\nJudge:\nWas it a hit-and-run, or do you know who hit it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe person stayed. They claimed they fell asleep and struck the car. They also totaled my neighbor’s car in front.\n\nJudge:\nShe was paying $188 a month for insurance, right?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but that wasn’t the full amount. I was still putting in money to make up the rest.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause she didn’t want to pay the full amount. She told me it was too much money.\n\nJudge:\nBut at no point do you take the car back from her?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhy not?\n\nDefendant:\nI didn’t want to go down that road. Honestly, I didn’t want to.\n\nJudge:\nSo you knew she hadn’t registered the car?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then she gets into an accident. The insurance company declares it a total loss. She wants the insurance check because it’s her car, and you want to keep it because it’s in your name. Is that correct?\n\nDefendant:\nPartially.\n\nJudge:\nWhat am I missing?\n\nDefendant:\nAbout a week before the accident, she called the police on me.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause we had an argument, and she hit me in the face with a washcloth. I went to hit her back but didn’t. She called the cops and said I hit her, but the police found out it wasn’t true. After that, I shut the business down.\n\nJudge:\nHow much was the insurance check?\n\nDefendant:\n$1,800.\n\nJudge:\nAnd why should you get it when you never registered the car in your name?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI took care of the car and spent $2,554 maintaining it.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, on your lawsuit against him for the $1,800—\n\nJudge:\nI rule in your favor. You were paying the insurance. I don’t like that you didn’t register it, but it wasn’t a secret to him. I order him to pay you that money.\n\nOn the $2,554 for maintenance? No.\n\nFor stress and aggravation? No.\n\nVerdict for the plaintiff for $1,828.01.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": ", playing the victim, gaslighting, minimization, deflection"}

{"id": "959", "dialogue": "Judge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff rented commercial space to the defendant, who opened a hair salon. The plaintiff says the defendant was heavy into weed and trashed the place, but the defendant says the problems were from another tenant. It's the case of the salon that gave everyone a buzz. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: A68 LLC, represented by Ms. Drab. You're the owner?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, you're suing Ashley Packard for $3,227 in rent and utilities because, according to you, she violated a stipulation that the two of you had entered into in landlord-tenant court. All right, you own a piece of property that is a salon?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And when did you start renting it?\n\nPlaintiff: In December.\n\nJudge: So how long were you there in total?\n\nDefendant: A year and a half.\n\nJudge: Okay. And what went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason we're here is because she did not meet the stipulations.\n\nJudge: Right. How did you end up in landlord-tenant court? What was the first thing that went wrong in this tenancy?\n\nPlaintiff: The rent was not paid for July and August.\n\nJudge: Okay, so July and August of what year?\n\nPlaintiff: 2018.\n\nJudge: Did you pay July and August?\n\nDefendant: No, that's because I received a notice to quit.\n\nJudge: Okay. Were you in the middle of a lease?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: All right, so she stops paying rent, and why did you give her a notice to quit? Had you received any complaints or anything?\n\nPlaintiff: The reason was that she was constantly late with rent. Also, the electricity had to be paid at that time. Sometimes she would pay it at the same time, sometimes later. But there were other reasons. I spoke to her because she brought in people to do acrylic nails. The acrylic nails were producing a very bad offensive odor, which traveled. The lady upstairs had commented on it, and I spoke with her. She said that the ones that were doing the nails were going to be bringing in a ventilation system. That stuff never works.\n\nJudge: All right. Anyway, so what was the deal with the people who you hired to do nails?\n\nDefendant: Let me quote you: they were Spanish and sometimes could be a bit mouthy. But the plaintiff was the one who was being disruptive to our business. You know, those Spanish people, they are quite mouthy. You know, those Latinos, they can be a bit mouthy. So yes, my girls who were working for me or with me—I should say because they rented their spots—they could be a little… They just stood their ground with what they knew was right.\n\nJudge: Okay. But what was it that they were standing their ground about? Would she come in person and complain, or was it the tenant upstairs coming down?\n\nDefendant: Gina was trying to get a hold of me. One day, I was in the middle of an updo class at another salon. When I got out of class, I heard all these voice messages from my co-workers telling me that she came in, she was screaming at them to stop doing what they were doing, to call me. And when they told her that I was at an updo class, they said that she threw down her purse on the floor, started snooping through my drawers in my station, and started going through the salon. And they said—\n\nJudge: Did they video her?\n\nDefendant: They didn't video her, but this is what happened.\n\nJudge: In this day and age, where basically everybody videos everybody all the time, there would be a video.\n\nDefendant: They were in the middle of doing nails. They had clients sitting in their chairs. It was just overall very unprofessional.\n\nJudge: All right. So there's no rent paid in July. There's no rent paid in August. You file a notice of eviction. You end up in landlord-tenant court. So there is a stipulation entered into that the defendant—that would be you—agrees to pay $1,665.28 no later than September 5th. Did you make that payment on September 5th?\n\nDefendant: I did, and I have the proof.\n\nJudge: How did you make the payment on September 5th?\n\nDefendant: Check.\n\nJudge: Did you mail it, or what did you do?\n\nDefendant: I actually drove to her house and put the check in her mailbox.\n\nJudge: So, the picture you have is you putting the check in her mailbox?\n\nDefendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. Is that your mailbox?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: And the picture is dated September 5th at 10:00 at night. Technically, she complied. So you don't see it until September 6th, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you deposited it on September 6th. So that was one of the things you said she didn’t comply with, but you cannot prove that she didn’t comply with it.\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So, the next thing she was supposed to do: the defendant agrees to remove all belongings, leave the premises broom clean, and return any and all keys to the plaintiff upon vacating. Any items left behind will be deemed abandoned. According to you, she didn’t do that?\n\nPlaintiff: She left it a mess.\n\nJudge: Tell me about it.\n\nPlaintiff: There was a station left, a chair left outside, garbage left, alcohol, clutter, nail polish, a sink on the landing…\n\nJudge: It was so simple. So, so simple. All you had to do was not leave garbage behind. Verdict for the plaintiff: $3,220.74.

Come to order, please. Litigants have been sworn in. Thank you, Douglas. Welcome in. Okay, everyone's asked not to mention company names or last names. Ron, you're suing Sierra for $5,000 that you say is owed to you because she extended a car rental and damaged the car?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes ma'am, and put me in a position where I couldn't make money off the car.\n\nJudge:\nYou are counterclaiming against him $1,500 for harassment and wrongful arrest. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI rented to her previously, some months earlier, and she...\n\nJudge:\nWhat did you do for a living?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI rent cars. I rent cars and I have a party bus as well.\n\nJudge:\nAre they cars that you own?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes ma'am.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a business doing this?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes ma'am.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have an office where you do it out of? Do you advertise, or do you just go word of mouth?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nWord of mouth, um, business cards, and I have...\n\nJudge:\nHow many cars do you own?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nRight now it's just two.\n\nJudge:\nWhat about when this happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nWhen that happened, it was three.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. She is someone who had rented from you before?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes ma'am.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how long were you renting to her for?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nThe original date was for one day and she told me she was going to come back and pay me some more for... um... I think she said she wanted to keep it a little longer. I think a week maybe.\n\nJudge:\nAnd after the day passed, what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nOkay, now hold on. What was it you rented to her?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nA 2013 BMW 535.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how much were you charging her?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\n$80 a day.\n\nJudge:\nHow much?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\n$80 a day.\n\nJudge:\nIs that competitive? Is that a good rate, or is it high or low?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nIt was a desperate situation. I needed a vehicle at the moment.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you couldn't go to like Enterprise and rent a cheap car?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nNo, because my name is actually messed up with Enterprise due to a situation with my sister not returning a vehicle. So, until I paid them, I exhausted all the other rental car places.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you went to the gentleman who does it in the alley, is that it? Like, how does this work?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nKind of, sort of. You could say it like that because actual Enterprise... I'm on the do-not-rent list until I pay them.\n\nJudge:\nDo not rent list?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nWhat about Hertz or Avis or National or Thrifty?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nNo, because the credit card that I use with Enterprise is affiliated with that, so I have to clear up the money on the credit card, and they don’t accept... so he doesn’t take credit cards.\n\nJudge:\nNo?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nIt’s just cash.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you just give him cash?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nHow much?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI gave him $250 as a deposit.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So, she gave you $250 plus $80?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and then what happens?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI actually met him at a gas station, which is where he conducts his business.\n\nJudge:\nRight on in Queens, and I met him at the bail bonds office, which is how I got his business card. So, that's where he goes around giving people stuff so that they can rent vehicles.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nSo, he’s providing a service, right?\n\nJudge:\nYes.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nThere you go. He can make the money, and he's providing a service that apparently you can't get elsewhere, so what the heck.\n\nJudge:\nExactly, which is why I chose to use him. So, July 31st, now I called him. He said that he did have a vehicle, which was the 2013 BMW. I said, okay, I need it for one day, and I let him know when I got to the gas station with my then boyfriend. I let him know that the rental... I wanted to keep it for longer, but as of right now, I’m paying for one day and tomorrow when I return with the vehicle, which would have been August 1st, I’m going to have the rest of the money to compensate whether it be two days, three days, or four the week.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nNo, what happened? It didn’t happen like that. Instead of like that, I’m going to tell you right now...\n\nJudge:\nMonday, when I came back with the car, I called him and told him that I was running late with the vehicle. I would bring it to him Tuesday morning. He okayed it and said you just have to pay for Tuesday and everything was in communication. Everything was fine.\n\nJudge:\nTuesday now, when I called him to return the vehicle, I didn’t get a response.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nNow, being that I have to drop it to him back at the gas station, if I would have left the vehicle there, that would have been an issue. So now, when he didn’t answer his phone on Tuesday, it’s like now I have no choice but to still have the car, and I’m still going to have to pay for it because I have the car.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what happened on Wednesday?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nWednesday, I spoke to him again, and I told him that I was going to extend the car. He said for how long, and I told him like three days tops.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nWednesday I was at the bank. I spoke to him while I was in the bank, and I said, I’m at the bank right now, and I’m going to call you and bring you the money. He said okay, no problem. That was at about 11:15ish. So after that took place, my sister called me in an emergency and said she needed me to drive her home.\n\nJudge:\nWhere?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nTexas.\n\nJudge:\nWhat? You need a ride to Texas?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhy would you... you think that was okay?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nNo, not with his vehicle. Not in his vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nNo?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nShe had her own car.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t say all of a sudden, I have to go to Texas?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nNo, she knew about the vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nAnd I also called him on Wednesday and left a message. I let him know, and I told him that because my boyfriend went with me to pick up the vehicle, he saw how he looked, and I felt that it would be okay for him to return it because I had to leave in an emergency.\n\nJudge:\nSo you left the car in your boyfriend’s care?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nTo be returned the next day?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat did your boyfriend do? Did he return the car?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nAbsolutely not, which is why we’re here.\n\nJudge:\nSo, how do you feel about this?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nThe whole thing feels like harassment. And, you know, I was put in a position where I was under emergency circumstances.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you got arrested after this?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhen?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nIt was a few days after the incident where I left the car to be returned. I received a call and said the car was stolen, so I got arrested.\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nIt wasn’t stolen. It was just sitting there for a while, and I was trying to get in touch with her.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you want for all of this?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI want the harassment to stop and to be compensated for wrongful arrest.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, we'll look at the evidence.    Judge:\nAlright, so here's the deal. You’re saying you were wrongfully arrested and harassed?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nYes, I believe I was. He called the police, said the car was stolen, and I got arrested in the middle of doing my hair at the salon. It was embarrassing, and completely unnecessary.\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nShe never returned the car, and when I tried to reach her, she wouldn't answer. I had no choice but to call the cops to report it. It was a stolen vehicle at that point because I couldn't get in touch with her.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you're saying she rented the car and then just stopped communicating with you?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes, exactly. I had been trying to get in touch with her for days and nothing. She wasn’t picking up the phone, and I didn't know where the car was.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nThat’s not true. I told him I needed more time, and I was planning to return it. I just needed more time, and I let him know. It was never meant to be some big issue. I was going through things, and it wasn’t like I was just ignoring him.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. So it’s your claim that there was a lack of communication that led to this situation?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes. And also, the car was damaged when I got it back, which is why I'm asking for compensation.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI didn't damage the car. That's an exaggeration. It wasn't perfect when I got it, but it wasn’t damaged to the extent that he’s claiming.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let's talk about the damage. Ron, what kind of damage are you talking about?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nThe bumper was scratched up, and there were dents. It wasn’t in the condition I rented it out to her. And on top of that, I lost income because I couldn’t rent it out to anyone else while it was with her.\n\nJudge:\nSierra, how do you respond to that?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI didn't damage the car. I took care of it. If anything happened to it, it happened when it was sitting there for days while I was trying to get in touch with him. And I wasn't driving it around the way he's saying.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any proof of this damage, Ron?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI have photos. I took pictures when I got the car back.\n\nJudge:\nCan you provide those photos, please?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes, Your Honor. Here they are.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nThat doesn’t show the real condition of the car when I got it. I don’t believe those photos are accurate.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, I’ll review the photos. We’ll also need to look at the terms of your rental agreement to see if there are any clauses about damages or the responsibilities of renters in this situation.\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nYes, of course.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI also want to point out that I did call him before I was arrested. I left messages explaining what was going on.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, we'll look at the phone records. Do you have any of those phone records to show communication, Sierra?\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI don’t have them with me, but I did call him and left messages. I have a witness who was with me when I was making the calls.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any proof of these calls, Ron?\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI don’t have any proof of those calls, but I was trying to reach her and couldn’t. That’s why I took action.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, it seems there’s a lot of back and forth here. I’m going to need time to review all the evidence.\n\nDefendant (Sierra):\nI just don’t think I should be held responsible for the damage or the arrest. I was under a lot of stress and had an emergency.\n\nPlaintiff (Ron):\nI understand that, but she didn’t handle the situation professionally, and that’s why I’m suing her. I had to cover my losses.\n\nJudge:\nUnderstood. I'll make a decision once I have all the facts.

Oh my gosh, you're like sisters. You're suing Johnny's Hollywood Limousine Incorporated and Social Lights Limousine represented here by John Hayes. Yes? Okay. For $5,000, $250 of it a deposit that they refused to return and the rest of it for pain and suffering. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Well, it started on March 2nd, we called and hired him for a 10-passenger limo for prom night for June 21st of the same year. On June 14th, one week before the prom, I called him to give him the specifics and get everything ready, and he told me that a 10-passenger limo is not really for 10 passengers because the driver counts. So, I was, I was, it's a prom, so I was thinking, somebody was going dateless. Yes, so I was forced to upgrade to a limo that would hold the 10 kids. Fine, there was one week left, I had no choice. The price was very good, I have no problem with the price, so we upgraded. And then he...\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): And you had to pay extra?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes, I did. But whatever. So then he informed me it worked out for him anyway because he had another job for the limo, the original limo in Smithtown. So it worked out for him and...\n\nJudge: Wait, because he was farming this out?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes, he subcontracted it out.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): So, all is well and fine. Prom night comes, she puts on her gown, all her friends meet at the pickup place at 6:00 p.m. She got excited, they were supposed to pick up at 6:15. She called the driver to make sure that he was coming on time and the driver said, \"Didn't John call you?\" And I said, \"No, John gave me your number,\" and he said, \"My transmission blew at 4:30. John was supposed to make other arrangements.\" And I never got a call from John. At that point, I started crying hysterically and he hung up.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): And my mom attempted to call John from five or six different numbers. He wouldn't answer the phone. Finally, he answered, got in touch with her, found out that it was her, and hung up on her.\n\nJudge: He hung up on you?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): He hung up on her.\n\nJudge: And you called him repeatedly from different numbers?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes, I called him repeatedly.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): He said, \"I'll call you back in two minutes,\" but he didn't call back. I mean, it was a nightmare. So we put the kids in a minivan and sent them to the prom.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): The prom started at 7:00, so you got into the...\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): At 7:50. And then I had to go through security and all 10 of us had to check in. We went in a minivan.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): You all packed in the minivan?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes, we had no other choice.\n\nJudge: Several people didn't have seat belts.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Right.\n\nJudge: Okay, and in all fairness, then I spoke with John again, but the kids were already on the road and he said, \"Well, I'll send the stretch limo.\" First of all, they're already there, they're gone, and then it was only for eight kids. What do you expect me to do with the last two kids?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): So it just, it was impossible. And then on the 23rd, I spoke with him. I said, \"So I want my deposit back and I want these kids to have a free night out. That's what I want.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): He said, \"I can only do eight kids.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Well, how am I supposed to choose which two kids it's okay for and which eight get to go?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): It's okay for mine to go, but who are the other ones going to be? So it wasn't an option. Then we went away on vacation. When I returned, I still never heard from John, never got my deposit back, nothing. I emailed him, he never responded.\n\nJudge: His partnership, his partner office, which is Social Lights Limo, which is also on your invoice, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Yes.\n\nJudge: Which is also on my invoice.\n\nJudge: Who owns Social Lights Limo?\n\nDefendant (John): It's my wife.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Oh, that's your wife?\n\nDefendant (John): Yes.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): That's the wife who's sending the emails.\n\nDefendant (John): Oh, your wife is sick of you? Okay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Let me see those emails from Social Lights.\n\nJudge: Is your wife here with you?\n\nDefendant (John): She was supposed to come, no, she just couldn't make it. It was just a nightmare and it was one thing after another. They didn't return the deposit. They knew this was, when he booked it in March, he knew this was going to happen.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): This is the email from Social Lights Limousine: \"I just got this email from the junk folder and found out about the problem with the prom. I apologize for causing and ruining your daughter's prom. There is no excuse for how John handled that day and not informing me about it. I'm very sorry it even happened. Please email back or call John to arrange a refund or to set up a time to meet John to give you your deposit back. I am sorry for all the inconvenience and the bad moment you and yours had to endure on such a special day.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): What happened? I got a TLC driver from Queens with shoulder pictures.\n\nJudge: What TLC?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): The company, Taxi Limousine Commission.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): That had to be the right car for that prom because it was in Nassau County and could fit 12 people.\n\nDefendant (John): Okay, she had 10. She said fine for a little bit more. I said that driver wants a deposit. This is the type of car that's the exact car.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Supposedly the exact.\n\nDefendant (John): No, we never saw the car.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): How did you get these pictures?\n\nDefendant (John): I have his... I have his in my computer.\n\nDefendant (John): You were subbing this to another because we didn't have any cars. It was all sold out that night. It sold out for months. The driver was on his way. He had transmission problems, he overheated, he called the limo builder, gave, you know, one of the mechanics.\n\nJudge: What time did this vehicle break down?\n\nDefendant (John): It broke down around, her pickup was going to be around six-ish, so he left early, I guess around four-ish.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant (John): I was also working. Why, in two hours, had you not alerted them that there was a problem?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): The plaintiff hired the defendant's limo for the prom and the dude was a no-show and the girl missed part of the prom. The guy had a mechanical problem but made it her problem.\n\nJudge: Let's listen.\n\nDefendant (John): I don't know if he called them first or me, I was also doing a prom myself.

She agreed with me. She thought I was going to win this case.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but you didn't.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): All right, head right down this way.\n\nJudge: So, what are you entitled to? How much was a prom ticket?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): $105.\n\nJudge: I'm going to order you to pay back the $250, which you had zero right to keep. I'm going to order you to pay her the price of the ticket for the prom that she paid, $105. And I'm also going to order you to pay another $200 for her troubles, for having to come to court and sue you when you have a defenseless claim. Absolutely defenseless to having returned the $250. That's my verdict. The total judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $555.\n\nJudge: Well, first out of the court was the limo guy. Come on over here. The defendant losing this case and not looking too good in the process.\n\nDefendant (John): Well, like I said, we offered a replacement one, and that says that in the contract she signed it.

I think he knowingly did it and that's...\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): You think you'll be popular again when you get back and your friends all find out you won the case on the People’s Court?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): Maybe a little bit, but it was still a once in a lifetime thing.\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): You going to welcome them back or you going to get new friends?\n\nPlaintiff (Christine): I'll take her advice. Not welcome them back.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, life throws you lemons, and it’s your job to make them into lemonade. You've got a great story associated with your prom. You ended up on People’s Court, you're going to end up winning. But if I... lucky for you I don’t believe that, that it was true that you're... Oh my life is... I really would think that your mother needs to send you to therapy, not college.\n\nJudge: Okie dokie, but what are you entitled to?

{"id": "97", "dialogue": "Douglas (Court Clerk):\nOkay, Ediberto Palasio, you are suing Aaron. You've asked us just to call you by the name Aaron?\n\nAaron:\nYes.\n\nDouglas:\nFor $5,000. According to you, you're out actually more than that, but that's the statutory limit in New York for damages to your vehicle that was in her care. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nWell, Your Honor, I never, I would say it wasn't damages. I never received the vehicle back, so it's no damages. I didn't get it. Okay, so the loss, that you and you say that's her fault, the vehicle and the property within was all lost. It was never returned to me.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nWell, Your Honor, I was going to Georgia to work and for approximately 30 days, she asked if she could borrow...how you know her?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nI know her. We met while I was... I'm a general contractor, and one of her former employers was my client. We became friends, and she asked to borrow the car, and I let her borrow it while I was gone for a month.\n\nJudge:\nFriends, or just regular friends?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nFriends. Friends.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, and so, go on. Why don't I have any friends like that? Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nWhat were the terms of her using it?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nNothing. You're just being nice. She has a boyfriend that lives up by Canada, about 300 miles away, and I didn't want her to go there, and I didn't want anything to happen with the vehicle. I didn't want her to be in any jeopardy or the vehicle to be in any jeopardy. So you wanted it nice and safe in New York City?\n\nJudge:\nRight, okay, gotcha. Alright, so what happens? You now have the car, and what goes wrong?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nI had the car, um, I drove around with him all day. I dropped him off. He left in the U-Haul truck to go to Georgia. I drove the car home to the Bronx. Saturday, I drove to a birthday party of my, um, little baby cousin. I have my daughter in the car with me. Um, we were coming home like about 11:30. The car is smoking, like, on the FDR.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nOkay, come on up.\n\nJudge:\nSo you had the car one day?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nWell, I had it from Thursday. So I went to the party on Saturday. I didn't drive it on Friday. Just on Saturday. I was in the house.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nOkay, so, um, the car is smoking. I'm freaking out. I'm calling him. He didn't pick up the phone. I'm calling my best friend, and I'm like, this car is smoking. I don't know what to do. So I pulled over to the shoulder, and, um, when I called her, she's like, well, where are you?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nHer and her fiancé were driving to Long Island, and they just came out there. Where was it that you were that you had pulled over?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nRight on the shoulder of the FDR by the Water Club over there.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you got there, what did you see?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nWhen I got there, the hood was up, there was smoke. Apparently, it looked like, I'm not a mechanic, but I know a little bit about cars, the cap on the antifreeze, while she was driving, the water elevated and it flew off, and that's what caused smoke to the car, the radiator. There was lack of antifreeze.\n\nJudge:\nGo ahead.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nSo, you know, they came. They put the antifreeze in there, and we're like, okay. She's like, \"We'll follow you home.\" They followed me all the way to the Bronx. Everything was good. You know, they left. The next day, I drove down to Canal Street. Then when I was going to go on the West Side Highway, I got to the Holland Tunnel entrance, and the car again, it's like overheating, and I was calling him, because then it started making like this loud grinding noise.\n\nJudge:\nAt this point, you are where now?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nOn Greenwich Street. Okay, so I'm talking to him, and I'm asking him, you know, what could be wrong with the car or whatever. He said he didn't put oil in it for the past 2 years. Um, he said that he's not for sure. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to wait till somebody moves out of this parking... you know, and then I'll turn it back on and I'll park in there, which I did. So then I took a cab to a gas station, I got three quarts of gas, of oil, and I poured them in there. I sat there like 10 minutes, so, you know, to see if it would get in there, the oil. So then I started it, and it's still making the grinding noise.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nAnd I told him, I don't know what to do, and he's like, \"Well, try to drive it.\" I said, \"Okay, I'm going to try to drive it up to 24th Street where I got the oil initially.\"\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn't you drive it to where he was at? You were asking her to drive it to a friend's lot on 137?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nYes. How far away is 137?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nIt's in Harlem, and I was all the way downtown, like 20 minutes, but that car wouldn't have made it now. Are you telling him this from the beginning?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nThe car is there, and that's where I'm leaving it. Tough things, no. I told him I was going to take it there. He said, \"Okay, take it there. See what they tell you is wrong with it.\" I said, \"Okay.\" But I'm leaving it because I can't do anything else with it. I got to go get my daughter from school. He goes, \"Okay, okay.\"\n\nJudge:\nSo then they tell you that it needs... what?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nThe place that she said she left it at was not a general mechanic. They were not open to the public. The guy said that she parked it outside on the street.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nWell, did it get towed?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nI believe so. Why didn't you check?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nI called the marshals, and all the marshals were telling me they didn't have it, that they didn't tow it.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nRight. I don't know what happened to the car. When you left the car at the place you say you left the car, did you have any paperwork from them?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nThey gave me a card. That's it. And I have the address of it right here. I sent them an email with the address of it, you know.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nYou know who you left it with?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nNow, I don't know his... remember his name.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Show me the email.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nIt's an email she sends on June 4th:\n\"Eddie, as per your request, I dropped off your Dodge and trip it at the mechanic at West 25th Street for it to be evaluated. I will check on it for you since you're out of town in Atlanta to let you know how much they will charge you.\"\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nThen you answer her the next day:\n\"I never requested you drop off my vehicle anywhere except for my friend's lot on 137th Street. You agreed to be responsible for the vehicle when I asked you to hold it. I'm not asking you to get it fixed. I'm asking you to take it to 137th, where it'll be safe.\"\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nThen you answer her:\n\"Contact your peoples in 137th, and wow, this is worse than my teenager. Let me know when they are available for it to be dropped off.\" Harassing a single mother, but it's all good. God will take care of you.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nThe heck does that mean?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nBecause he was... you knew when nobody's ever supposed to do anything that bothers you, because you're a single mother. What the deal was with your car and you trying to pin it on me? And please just let me know when they are available. Don't continue to harass me or threaten me.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nBecause he said legal action.\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nNo, see, I had a problem with my other... the phone. So I don't have a lot of the text messages that he sent me.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nOkay, or I will be forced to take out an order of protection. I know you're past it, and I have a child to think about. I can read between the lines. I do not want to be hurt by you.\n\nJudge:\nWhy are you even saying that? He didn't say anything about hurting you. He talked about... he didn't say it in the emails, and he said it verbally.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nThen you answer her:\nHe is expecting you any time after 9:00 AM. Please call first. Did you ever do that?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nI found out it was $130 to go, but I couldn't do it, so it was a $130 problem. Now it becomes a $5,000 problem because the car is missing.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever go back to the place and say, \"Hey, where the heck's the car?\"\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nAfter he started harassing me.\n\nJudge:\nDid you park it on the street or did you park it inside?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nInside.\n\nJudge:\nBecause that's not what they're telling you. Right?\n\nPlaintiff (Ediberto):\nThe guy said that it was towed. It was parked illegally. That's who... the guy who she said she left it with. She says they never accepted any vehicle because they don't do it. He said that she left it on the street.\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so they know she exists, they know there is a car, they know this is their business, and they took a key. He said that she came and being that he said that they don't do work on private vehicles, they said that they have contact...\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nHow did you pick them?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\nBecause the car was overheating. The gas station told me there was a mechanic right on 25th street. I went, I spoke to him. I parked it on the side with the hazards on. I went inside. I spoke to the man. He said to give the keys and my name and number to the lady that's sitting down. After that, they called me. They told me that it was a busted water pump, and the timing belt was broken, and it was $600 for a Dodge Dodge Ram.\n\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, what year?\n\nDefendant (Aaron):\n99.\n\nJudge:\nShe saved all of this information between me and her going back and forth, and I notified her that this would become a legal issue if she dropped my vehicle off at this place that she says, which I honestly don't believe exists. If she did, and she left something, she should be able to produce some type of documentation.

{"id": "498", "dialogue": "[Judge]: Katherine Pavnick, you are suing Christopher Aras for $1,168.32 in cell phone bills that he incurred in your name and has refused to pay. Oh, $250 of that is for time and aggravation and $290 of it is the early termination fee. What happened?\nPlaintiff: In about January of 2012 he was on a prepaid account with Verizon and he asked me if he can come onto my account with Verizon.\n[Judge]: How come?\nPlaintiff: He was sick of his prepaid, he said he wanted...\n[Judge]: What kind of people go on a prepaid who are grown? How old are you?\n[Judge]: Grown men go on a prepaid... you can't think of any answers to that?\n[Judge]: Think harder. If you have to be on a prepaid, what does that mean?\nPlaintiff: He can't afford it.\n[Judge]: Right, either he can't afford it or he won't afford it. He's got bad credit. How do you get bad credit?\nPlaintiff: By not paying your bills.\n[Judge]: And so what did you immediately go out and do?\nPlaintiff: I added him to my plan.\n[Judge]: Why are you adding this guy to your plan?\nPlaintiff: We were kind of seeing each other at the time.\n[Judge]: Kind of seeing each other, what does that mean?\nPlaintiff: We were together but there was no title. He told me...\n[Judge]: Together but no title. He told you... and then you get a cell phone in his name for him?\n[Judge]: Why did you let her put a cell phone in her name for you?\nDefendant: Um, you know it was something nice she did, yes. Um, she basically is accusing me of not paying bills when I did.\n[Judge]: She's accusing you of not paying any bills since January of 2012. How were you paying it?\nDefendant: I was paying um, some mostly cash at the store.\n[Judge]: At what store?\nDefendant: Verizon Wireless.\n[Judge]: You were physically going to the store?\n[Judge]: So if you paid then you'd have a receipt to show that you paid?\nDefendant: I don't have them.\n[Judge]: Well then you guess you didn't pay if the phone bills show that you didn't pay, right?\nDefendant: No, I guess it doesn't show.\n[Judge]: Well then if you paid wouldn't it show? Of course yes. So then if the phone bills show me the phone bills say that nothing has been paid on that phone number since January, what would that mean?\nDefendant: Well I have a copy here of the last statement that I received...\n[Judge]: And where were the bills going to? A guy tells you that he's not going to make you his girlfriend so you're basically a booty call, alright, and then you put a phone in your name for him? Why would you do that? Why do you have such a poor self-image? How old are you?\nPlaintiff: I'm 24 now.\n[Judge]: Okay, so why would you have such a poor self-image that you would do that? You're a perfectly lovely young lady, why would you do that?\nPlaintiff: I'll be honest, I was stupid.\n[Judge]: Was he that charming?\nPlaintiff: Yeah, at the time you really liked them.\n[Judge]: Do you understand that when a woman who likes you more than you like her gets a phone in your name it's to track you?\nDefendant: No seriously, I'm very... I'm a lot more technical than that. I don't get tracked.\n[Judge]: You don't get tracked?\n[Judge]: You found out he was sleeping with other women?\nPlaintiff: Mhm, yeah.\n[Judge]: How'd you find that out?\nPlaintiff: I stumbled across a second Facebook of his.\n[Judge]: Oh no, she's not a tracker at all. So how did you stumble upon... he's... she's a tracker and you're a two-timer with experience because he has... you give one of them one Facebook and then... Oh tell me how you do it, inquiring minds all around America want to know. How many Facebooks do you have?\nDefendant: Depends on how many girls you have... one.\n[Judge]: One Facebook? Okay, but you say you stumbled upon a second one?\n[Judge]: And so tell me about the second one.\nPlaintiff: It had his information and it had a girl you know posting him back and forth with the other girl \"Happy Valentine's Day I love you.\"\n[Judge]: Well I don't know to sort of... the fact that he wouldn't call you his girlfriend or spends you know all of his time with you was pretty much evidence that you didn't have a claim to him. I don't know that he lied to you in any regard. I think it's kind of you being a chump, don't you think?\n[Judge]: Going inside the courtroom, there is no question that you were supposed to pay this because you say \"oh I did.\" That's your defense, not \"oh she was... that was a gift\" but \"oh I did pay some of those\" and then when I ask you \"okay prove that you paid some of those\" you're unable to prove it.\n[Defendant]: Well I look at it as I like... say I go food shopping, um I get a receipt from the store. Who really keeps those?\n[Judge]: I do.\n[Defendant]: I don't.\n[Judge]: Okay, I don't keep them for food shopping but I keep them if I'm going to owe somebody money.\n[Defendant]: I didn't think it was going to be a problem here.\n[Judge]: Okay, well then just prove that you paid them some other way. All you have to do is bring me proof that you paid something.\n[Defendant]: Well it's kind of hard to prove when you pay cash.\n[Judge]: No it's not, it's just hard for you because you didn't. And I don't find you that charming so I'm not gonna say \"oh that's okay\" like she did. That's not what's gonna happen. You have some video you want to show me? Because that's usually happens when somebody has video. Or you do?\n[Judge]: Who has... you do have video and what is the video of?\nPlaintiff: The video is him verbally agreeing to pay me back the money.\n[Judge]: What did you... when did you guys stop seeing each other?\nPlaintiff: In February of 2012.\n[Judge]: Okay. The video happened about mid-February. My question is why is there still a March bill and an April bill and a May bill and a June bill and a July bill? Like why would there still be bills with Verizon?\n[Judge]: Why would you not have canceled the phone the day after you stopped seeing each other?\nPlaintiff: I didn't have the money.\n[Judge]: Money to... you didn't have the $290?\n[Judge]: So instead... yeah but you figured out how to sue for... I mean seriously you couldn't buy... who's that friend? She couldn't loan her $290 to stop the bleeding? Who are you? Come on up, who are you?\n[Witness]: I'm just a witness that saw the tape.\n[Judge]: Oh let's see the tape.\n[Video Audio]: You need to... you owe my friend a lot of money for helping you out. My uncle's a cop. I will get you arrested if you don't pay her back for what she done for you. I'm telling me that it's mutual... mutual agreement right?\n[Voice on Video]: Proof right here, mutual agreement Chris?\n[Defendant on Video]: Yes, mutual agreement.\n[Voice on Video]: You will pay my friend back everything?\n[Judge]: Okay, you can go inside now. They can stop your video after that.\n[Unknown Voice]: I love you!\n[Judge]: Oh that wasn't me.\n[Unknown Voice]: Oh who did that?\n[Judge]: I love whoever did that. That's a friend. Where were you when that got taped?\nPlaintiff: In front of my house.\n[Judge]: So why are you such a jerk? Why don't you pay her?\n[Defendant]: Well I was... I'd be willing to pay her what I owe her what I gave you the copy of...\n[Judge]: What do you mean you gave me the copy?\n[Defendant]: Of this is one page of a four page...\n[Judge]: Where's the rest of it?\n[Defendant]: It was just in detail of...\n[Judge]: Yeah I want to see the in detail. Give me the four pages.\n[Defendant]: But this is what you... let me try to correlate to what she has and see if...\n[Judge]: Okay the very last bill that you get says that the amount is $866.74 right? So why are you suing for $1,168.32?\nPlaintiff: Um, part of that was the early termination fee...\n[Judge]: No but that... the very last bill that you get has the early termination fee on it doesn't it? Or no?\nPlaintiff: Yes it does.\n[Judge]: So if the very last bill you got is $866.74, why are you suing for $1,168.32?\nPlaintiff: Time and aggravation, stress.\n[Judge]: You know what? Sometimes life lessons are a little bit expensive. You should have learned a long time ago to value yourself a little bit more than you were valuing yourself here. You did that for one of two reasons - one is pathetic and the other one is kind of slimy. Either you just want to buy his love which never works, or you want to keep track on him which is kind of impressive but still slimy. Those are the only two reasons why women get men phones and it always astounds me that men don't understand that. They think they're pulling one over on you and on half those women they're not just pulling one over - the women are smarter than you think. Okay? But and they come and cry to me later. Alright? You are one of the criers.\n[Judge continues]: I would... what I would like to do is have a bright line new rule if I was Queen that if you are so... if it was... if you were my child I'd say suck it up so that it never happens again but I cannot do that because my hands are tied. I've got to sit here and right the wrong that... to me you'd learn more if I just let it go and if you were my daughter that's what I'd do. I'd want to see you working overtime to pay that bill because I want to know that never again in your life will you be a py... unfortunately I'm the judge on your case and not your mother so when you're the judge on the case you got to actually figure out what's owed and what's owed even considering all the adjustments which were most of what were paid in the year that you had that... almost a year that you had that phone uh leaves us with a balance of $866.74 that you owe what you're going to pay is every penny that she's out which is $866.74 plus your filing fee that is my judgment.

So, when did she chop down some trees?\n\nPlaintiff: It was July of last year.\n\nJudge: Okay. Were those trees on your property or her property? Or how are we going to figure this out?\n\nPlaintiff: At the time, we didn't know. I called her, I saw her, I called her, I spoke to her about the trees. I have pictures that I sent in. There are long pine trees going up. Some of the trees were rotten. When the wind blew near the back of my yard, where my door is, where my kids play, the trees were sitting right there. I voiced my concern to her. I said, \"You know, I'm afraid that the trees might fall on my house and kill someone.\"\n\nDefendant: She said to me that, \"Okay, it's no problem if you cut the trees down.\"\n\nJudge: If she gave you permission to cut them, why would you go to the town to check?\n\nDefendant: I wanted to be on the safe side.\n\nJudge: What safe side? If she gave you permission?\n\nDefendant: Well, exactly. The fact that I went to the town makes me nervous.\n\nJudge: Did you give her permission?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Then why did you go to the town?\n\nDefendant: I just felt like I needed to go to the town to make sure. Because both of us didn't know. She didn't even know that the land in question that she's saying I damaged was hers. The people from the church told her that the land was hers.\n\nJudge: Why would she not know what land is hers?\n\nDefendant: I don't know. She was the one who told me. The morning I spoke to her, both of us met up at the town.\n\nJudge: Why were you both at the town then?\n\nPlaintiff: I went to go look at my plot plan to see the boundary.\n\nJudge: When did things start to become a problem between you two?\n\nPlaintiff: It was in August, about a month after the trees were cut down and left on the property. I asked her when she was going to clean them up, and she replied, and I quote, \"I'm not going to clean them up. I'm going to let them stay there and rot.\"\n\nJudge: Had you previously given her permission to cut them?\n\nPlaintiff: I expressed to her that I did not want to see the trees go. The trees were healthy. I think the main reason why she wanted to cut them down was because she wanted more sunlight in her backyard, maybe because of her solar panels.\n\nJudge: Did the city get involved?\n\nPlaintiff: They said we could hire a surveyor to determine the property line.\n\nJudge: Did you hire one?\n\nPlaintiff: After the trees were cut down, yes.\n\nJudge: So, you now know they were her trees?\n\nDefendant: I guess so.\n\n(Judge reviews evidence.)\n\nJudge: I'm going to award you what you're asking for the pine trees, in total $829.53. I'm also going to award you $750 for cleanup. Defendant is ordered to pay Plaintiff $1,579.53.

{"id": "269", "dialogue": "Judge:\nOkay, Miss Stoval, good morning. So you had an earring that had sentimental value to you, and you wanted to have it... uh, you lost one of them?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo you went to his store in order to have a replica made, correct?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you went there, did he give you a price on having that replica made?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’d he say?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$275.\n\nJudge:\nAlright, and did he say he would be able to do it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what happens? You left? You put down how much?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI gave him $50 as a down payment.\n\nJudge:\nAnd did you receive something in writing saying what your balance was and what you’d paid?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nMay I see what you received?\n\n(PLAINTIFF HANDS DOCUMENT TO THE JUDGE)\n\nJudge:\nOkay. This is a second... okay, so how long did he tell you it would take?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe didn’t tell me how long it was going to take.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So all it says is \"14 karat, $275, $50,\" and then it's subtracted. Then it says \"$225,\" yes?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you go home, and then you get a phone call. And what does the phone call say?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me that he had my earrings ready, that I should come look at them.\n\nJudge:\nSo you come by, and you look at the earrings, and what—what do you...?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey weren’t my earring. He showed me two pairs of earrings, and neither of them were mine.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Did he tell you he was going to be showing you two pairs of earrings?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, he didn’t.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. And they were different than what—\n\nPlaintiff:\nThey were completely different earrings.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. Um... When you called her, what were you calling her for? To have her come in to do what?\n\nDefendant:\nTo see the similar earrings.\n\nJudge:\nSimilar earrings. But did you call her and tell her, \"Lady, they don't make your earring anymore, so I can’t buy it, so I’m going to have you come in and show you two other types of earrings\"? Did you tell her that? Or did you just say, \"Your earrings are ready\"?\n\nDefendant:\nI said, \"The factory sent me two samples similar to yours. You come here, look at it.\"\n\nJudge:\nI—she came. I don’t think you did. I think you said, \"Your earrings ready.\"\n\nDefendant:\nI—yeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, let’s say the earring is ready. You have—yeah. Let’s play the voicemail of what he said. That’s important because it’s indicative of a lack of respect for someone else’s time and of what someone else told you they wanted.\n\nPlaintiff:\n(PLAYS VOICEMAIL)\n\nVoicemail Recording (Defendant):\n\"How are you? I have your earring ready. Nice. Please come look at it. Thank you very much.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Um... Alright. So you tell her her earrings are ready, but what you planned to do is see if she’ll just buy these other earrings from you, correct?\n\nDefendant:\nWhat she asked—\n\nJudge:\nShe asked you to make a replica. Why didn’t you just do what she asked and paid for?\n\nDefendant:\nShe asked me to make a replica of that earring.\n\nJudge:\nSo, can a jeweler make an absolute replica of one earring? Is that possible?\n\nAudience Member:\nI think you can get as close as you can to it. My mom’s had it done before. But exact is really hard, just to kind of get that matching pair.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nAudience Member:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you say?\n\nAudience Member 2:\nI don’t think you can, ‘cause you didn’t have the blueprint to make it.\n\nJudge:\nWell, the blueprint is the earring, right?\n\nAudience Member 2:\nWell, I guess so, but the exact replication...\n\nJudge:\nBut the earring is better than a blueprint, isn’t it?\n\nAudience Member 2:\nI just say you’re wrong.\n\nJudge:\nI’m—I’m wrong?\n\nAudience Member 2:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Going inside the C-room.\n\nDefendant:\nI sent a sample to the factory. The factory called me. They said, \"This is discontinued to make. We have similar to that to show it to the customer. If she like it, that’s fine. If not, bring it back.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay. That’s kind of different than what I’m asking. She came to you to see if you can make a replica, not find another one. It sounds like what you were planning to do was find another one, and then when you couldn’t, you tried to bait and switch her and say, \"Take these.\"\n\nDefendant:\nYou didn’t want them, that scene didn’t go very well.\n\nJudge:\nYou started crying.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nUm... You mentioned your deceased father. What was that about?\n\nPlaintiff:\nWell, he kept talking to me in a loud, disrespectful manner as though he was my dad. That’s the only person that will talk to you in that manner. And I said, \"My father is dead. Stop talking to me like that.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYou know, and I kept asking myself, I said, \"I want my earring back. I want to—\"\n\nJudge:\nAnd what did he say to you about the earring?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me that he couldn’t give it back to me because it was melted down.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, but that didn’t happen, right? You didn’t melt the earring?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, no.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have the earring on you?\n\nDefendant:\nYes. I have everything.\n\nJudge:\nCan I see them?\n\n(DEFENDANT HANDS EARRINGS TO THE JUDGE) Judge:\n(Examining the earrings) Okay. So, you didn’t actually melt down her earring, correct?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nThen why did you tell her that you did?\n\nDefendant:\nI didn’t tell her that.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, you did!\n\nJudge:\n(Skeptical) Okay… so why does she think you told her that?\n\nDefendant:\nI don’t know. Maybe she misunderstood me.\n\nJudge:\n(Shaking head) That’s a pretty big misunderstanding. Telling someone their sentimental jewelry has been destroyed when it actually hasn’t? That’s not a small detail to get wrong.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me he melted it down and that there was nothing he could do. I was devastated.\n\nJudge:\nAlright. So, you still have her original earring. And then you also have these two samples that you tried to offer her instead.\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So now she just wants her original earring back and her money back. What’s the problem?\n\nDefendant:\nWell, I had already started the process of making the replica. I put in the effort to match it. I sent the sample to the factory, and I invested time and resources into it.\n\nJudge:\nRight. But the deal wasn’t, “Take my $50 and do whatever you feel is best.” The deal was, “Make a replica.” And when you realized you couldn’t, you should have told her the truth instead of trying to pivot to something else.\n\nDefendant:\nI was just trying to help.\n\nJudge:\nNo, you weren’t. You were trying to salvage a sale. That’s different from helping.\n\nDefendant:\n(Silent)\n\nJudge:\nAlright. So, Miss Stoval, you’re suing for the $50 deposit, plus additional damages. What are the extra damages for?\n\nPlaintiff:\nEmotional distress. This earring was very special to me. I thought it was gone forever because of what he said.\n\nJudge:\n(Skeptical) Emotional distress?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes. I was crying. I couldn’t believe it. It was a piece of my past, my memories, and he made me think it was lost forever.\n\nJudge:\nHmm. I understand that was upsetting. But this is a small claims court. Emotional distress cases are generally not awarded in situations like this unless there was extreme negligence or intentional harm.\n\nPlaintiff:\nBut he lied to me.\n\nJudge:\nHe did, and that’s why I’m inclined to award you the $50 back. But I can’t award damages for emotional distress in this kind of case.\n\nPlaintiff:\n(Sighs) Okay.\n\nJudge:\nMr. X, do you have any reason why she shouldn’t get her money back?\n\nDefendant:\nI still put in work on this. I shouldn’t have to lose out completely.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re not losing out completely. You’re returning money that was given to you for a service you didn’t provide.\n\nDefendant:\nBut I—\n\nJudge:\nI’ve heard enough. Here’s my ruling.\n\nJudge’s Verdict:\nThe defendant must return the $50 deposit to the plaintiff.\nNo additional damages for emotional distress will be awarded.\nThe original earring must be returned to the plaintiff.\nJudge:\nThis could have been avoided with clear communication. Instead of telling her, \"Your earrings are ready,\" you should have told her exactly what happened. This wasn’t a minor misunderstanding—it was misleading.\n\nJudge:\nJudgment for the plaintiff. $50 and her earring back.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "gaslighting, emotional appeal, persuasion, deflection"}
{"id": "1024", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Douglas. Michael Miller and Brandy Miller are represented here by Michael Miller. You are suing Kenny Harris and Lake Hamilton Realty Incorporated, represented here by Kenny Harris, for $1,635, comprising the security deposit you believe you're entitled to, plus unused rent, and lost wages in having to come and sue for your security deposit back. Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, originally, we had moved to Hot Springs in July 2017, and we had a lease. Since I’m a teacher and had some possibilities of going back into coaching, I needed to be able to get out of the lease in the summer months in July. Okay, and so there are two clauses for termination of the lease. One of them is the tenant reserves the right to give 30-day notice to vacate the home before this lease is expired if we can rent the home immediately, no smoking in the home. And then the other way someone can terminate the lease is for the sale of the property, and this clause says, in the event the property is sold during the period of this residential lease, the tenant hereby agrees to vacate within 30 days' notice by the owner.\n\nJudge: Alright, so what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: So, in June, my wife contacted Heather about—\n\nJudge: Your wife?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, contacted Heather, who was the actual agent, and said that we had found a place we were looking into, to get out and—\n\nJudge: Listen to me, I’ve read the text. It’s way better for you than that. Hand me the text, please. Do you have it in your phone? I like to see text in a phone. What happens is, she starts communicating with you, yes?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And she says, “Hey, how are you? Would it be possible if we could get out of our lease if we found something a little bigger? Was just wondering. I know we have like five months left.” You say, “Let me ask them.” They say, “We absolutely love the house. We just want a little bit more room. If not, we will stay until our lease is up. We’re just curious.” You say, “Okay, I think they’re going to try to sell or rent it since you are wanting to find something bigger. Sounds like an okay for them to get out of their lease.” I mean, it sounds to the lay person like that we’re supposed to go look at a house Monday. I hope they’re not upset because your wife is so nice and she says they aren’t. I’ll come by around one Tuesday if that’ll work for you.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am, that’ll be fine. Thank you for understanding. You’re welcome. You guys have been so nice to us. Thank you for... I don’t know why I keep reading it in a Southern accent. Where are you guys from?\n\nDefendant: Arkansas.\n\nJudge: That must be it. Thank you. I hope we find something. How long do we have to be out? You answer, “They haven’t said you can stay for the remainder of your lease if you choose to do so. Just let me know when you find something. We will work out the time frame with you.” That, if what you meant to say, was, “You may lose your deposit. It depends on how fast we can rent it or something.” That would be a really good time to say that, rather than making it sound like you’re giving them permission.\n\nPlaintiff: Now, you ended up selling the house, right?\n\nDefendant: Yes, another agent.\n\nJudge: So the house gets sold, and I take it the owner was happy about that because they wanted to sell the house.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the closing date on that house is when?\n\nDefendant: It was August 18th, I think.\n\nJudge: Yes? Okay. But you’re wanting to keep his deposit for August rent when you couldn’t even give him August to live in for those two weeks?\n\nDefendant: There was nothing said that he had to move because the people were purchasing the home.\n\nJudge: No, I understand that. Okay, according to you, you think your lease gives you a right to do what?\n\nDefendant: Once they notified me of the sale, I had 30 days to move out according to the lease.\n\nJudge: You guys feel that he’s not entitled to it back because what?\n\nDefendant: He did not give written notice terminating the lease.\n\nJudge: So according to you, he can’t call his 30 days because he didn’t do it in writing?\n\nDefendant: I know written notice is written notice to your address, right?\n\nJudge: But now what about these texts that I’ve read out loud?\n\nDefendant: I’ve all been through. Thank you so much. Yes, that’ll be fine, and all that stuff because it’s not like they said, “Hey, we’re leaving,” and you go, “Okay.” I never call that acquiescence.\n\nJudge: Okay, is an alternative to shooting someone in the head. Like, what are you supposed to do to show your objection to them leaving? I get that, but this is different. This is permission to leave from her.\n\nPlaintiff: What do we do with that?\n\nJudge: Why are you looking at her? She’s just nice. So the landlord kind of says formally, “Yeah, of course you’re going to move out early.” Does that cancel out the lease, saying that you have to give 30 days' notice if the lease required written notice?\n\nDefendant: He says it.\n\nJudge: Then he—the lease is the lease, and is the lease the lease, or does what the landlord says control the lease?\n\nDefendant: It’s the lease.\n\nJudge: The landlord can change his mind. It’s only your word against his.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, if he agrees, he said it. That’s the question going inside the courtroom. You end up finding a place and letting them know that you found a place when? Around June 26?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we just got approved for the house they called you about. We really like that one too. You can advertise it today if you want, but I just had a call from the realtor that showed the other day, and she’s sending me an offer. We may be able to work out a deal with someone to buy it.\n\nJudge: Okay, it’s a nice house. I knew it wouldn’t take long for someone to buy or rent it. So now, June 28th. Mike, that’s you, is going to pay the rent, so it’ll be paid for next month.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, thank you.\n\nJudge: On June 29th, you say, “Hey, they accepted the offer. Yeah, we were going to give 30-day notice, but as far as I... this wasn’t terminated by me, it’s terminated by the owners when they sold it.”\n\nPlaintiff: So I think it was terminated by you too. I mean, when you tell them in June, we got approved for the house, but the house sold, so you know, hey, everybody wins. It’s all good. You know?\n\nDefendant: Oh, goodness, do we have to pay August rent?\n\nPlaintiff: No, the owner said that you won’t have to pay August rent, but the deposit will be forfeited because of early termination on the lease.\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, okay. Your wife says, “I thought as long as someone was in before it was time for us to pay rent again, and the house was like it was before, then we would get our deposit back. I know the lease was broken, but it worked out perfect for them. They were able to sell it. I’ll talk to them about it. I’m ready to end anything further.”\n\nJudge: Anything further from you?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Alright, you know, I think it’s a tad close, but I don’t feel any doubt about what I’m deciding, and I’m deciding that the security deposit goes back to him. I think that the tenor of the conversations between everybody is that, you know, what, go ahead and look for another place, because we’re going to sell it, which implies that we don’t need you here anymore. If we’re going to sell it, even if that turned out to not be the case, the language between the two parties was not “put your notice in writing like the thing requires in order to kick off the 30 days.” She asked before she even starts looking, “Am I going to be able to break the lease?” It doesn’t sound like “Yeah, but there’ll be penalties.” It sounds like “Yeah, no worries.” So I’m not going to give them a worry. You don’t get the portion of your unused rent just because you moved out early in July. You don’t get lost wages, but you do get that $1,200 and your court costs in order to get those $1,200.

We’ve been best friends, inseparable for a long time. About 2008-2009, we were both unemployed, going through financial issues. Hers were a bit more dire than mine because she had her apartment and her car. Me, I was taken care of by my daughter’s father, so I didn’t really want for anything. I had an account with Wachovia years ago when I was working downtown, and they closed my account due to an overdraw fee that they said I owed. But they waited a month and a half to cash a check that I had given them a while ago for rent. They waited until multiple things hit the account, so the account would go over. I disputed it, I paid it, but it took like a year and a half for the bank to recognize that I paid the red flag fee before they said I could open my own account.\n\nAre you trying to explain to me why you take money and put it in her account?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nYes, okay, you didn’t have creditors chasing you or a judgment against you or the tax man looking for you?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nNo, it was just the bank issue.

She ran into some complications where she wasn’t able to pay all of her rent and, I think, a car note. She had a notice on her door letting her know that she had to pay the rent by a certain date. She called me, and we usually spoke on the phone every day. She let me know the issue, and I told her, “Well, there’s money in your account. I’m not using it right now. It’s not a dire need for me to have it right now. It’s not anything for me to loan it to you right now. Do whatever you need to do with it.

That was to pay off whatever she needed to pay— I don’t know if it was for just rent or for both rent and car. I’m not sure.\n\nJudge:\nAt some point, you guys get into a rocky patch and you end up parting ways. Why was that?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nWe went to South Beach with a group of girls. We all went to South Beach. That summer, me and her had a falling out over an ordeal with her and her sister that I didn’t primarily agree with, and she thought that I should be on her side and be mad at her sister as well. But I’m not a person of that nature.\n\nJudge:\nBut you’d been friends since third grade, and a disagreement on vacation in South Beach one time—it was just other events leading up to that?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nYes, it was other events leading up to that, and that was probably the breaking point, I should say. South Beach was the kicker in, I guess, both of our lives for us to part ways.\n\nJudge:\nYou’re also suing her for a jacket and some shoes. What’s that about?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe jacket was trivial, but the shoes as well. There was a principle behind it. I had stuff at her house. Me and her go shopping at Mandy’s every now and again. We had stuff at her house. I had stuff that I wanted to take back, but I didn’t have the opportunity to take it back at that point in time. During that time, we had a really big flood. It rained really badly, and it flooded in front of her building.\n\nJudge:\nWait a second. When was this in relation to when you stopped talking to each other?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThis was prior to us stopping speaking. The jacket was probably about 6 months.\n\nJudge:\nAnd what about the shoes?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe shoes were $9 shoes.\n\nJudge:\nAre they whole shoes?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, okay, it was a shoe that I got. The shoes were left at her house because they were too big for me. I was going to go to the store and get store credit. I got them on sale, and she wore them. She said they fit her size.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t need them?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThey were only $9, but it’s the principle behind it. If you leave something at my house…\n\nJudge:\nBut you stayed friends after that?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, we didn’t stay friends after that.\n\nJudge:\nYou didn’t stop being friends over the $9 pair of shoes?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, we didn’t stop being friends over the $9 shoes. It was well after the $9 shoes. It was in the midst of us—it's just now that you’re suing, you’re going to bring up every little thing that happened between you?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nNo, it’s not every little thing. This is in the context of the lawsuit.\n\nJudge:\nTell me about the parking ticket.\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThe parking ticket was for her school. We went to her school, and we were both upstairs while she was talking to her advisor. I went downstairs, and the guy had already issued the ticket. He said he couldn’t give it back.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did that happen?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nThat happened in the summer.\n\nJudge:\nWhat summer?\n\nPlaintiff (Latoya Frasier):\nSummer of 2008.\n\nJudge:\nYou’ve known each other since third grade, and now you’re locked in the most trivial legal battle. The plaintiff is suing over a $9 pair of shoes in addition to other stuff. There’s got to be more to this. Let’s listen to what’s going on.\n\nJudge:\nShe says that you had money in your account, you knew it was her money, you used it, and then you never repaid it. What’s going on?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nThe plaintiff has never told me that I had to pay her money back. I never used what she’s claiming. It went from $550 to $700 now, which I have a text message to prove it. At the time, it wasn’t about my apartment or my car note. It was strictly about school and a cable bill. I told her, “My cable is going to be cut off.” I didn’t ask her for the money. I was telling her the situation, and she offered.\n\nJudge:\nShe said, “Don’t worry about it, you’re my best friend, I’ll give you the money.” Was this a loan or a gift?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nShe said, “Do not worry about it, I’m making $45,000 a year now, I don’t need the money back.” So I said, “Fine.”\n\nJudge:\nHow much was it?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nIt was $238 that I used for my cable bill.\n\nJudge:\nSo you have a statement from your uncle?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nYes. He gave me $310 for tuition.\n\nJudge:\nIs there a text between you two from back then that sheds some light on whether it was $550 or $238?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nI have a text message from her in March of this year.\n\nJudge:\nWhat does it say?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nIt doesn’t say how much money, but she said we could work out a payment plan for the $250.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you were asking for more money?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nYes, she texted back saying, “It’s funny how now you’re saying $300 when you owe me $550, but she’s suing me for $700 now.”\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any evidence of the parking ticket being paid?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nEverything was taken out of that account for her.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any emails or texts from back then?\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nI have a text message.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see it.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\n[Shows text message.]\n\nJudge:\nThese are not helpful.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nI have one more message.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see it.\n\nDefendant (Canel Alberino):\nI said, “I’ll send you monthly payments for the money you loaned me.”\n\nJudge:\nAlright, I see.\n\nJudge:\nThe question before me is: Is this a loan or a gift, and how much is it?\n\nJudge:\nThe defendant is a woman of integrity. I’ll rule against her.\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, framing the narrative, minimization"}
{"id": "517", "dialogue": "Judge: Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket, the plaintiff bought a Dodge Dakota from the defendant, and the guy never gave him the title. But the defendant says he was open and honest about the title problems. It's the case of \"Every Lawsuit Has a Title.\"\n\nJudge: Anthony Plone, you are suing Shan Barbery for $1,450 that you want returned to you—$1,200 for what you paid for a 2006 Dodge Dakota you can't title and $250 for towing. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: I bought the truck from him. I live in Massachusetts, so when I went to register it in the state of Massachusetts, you need the seller's name on a title and then my name as the buyer on the title.\n\nJudge: Of course, that's everywhere.\n\nPlaintiff: He had his aunt's name on it as the seller and him as the buyer.\n\nJudge: Oh, he jumped title. That means the aunt gave you the title to the car, but you never registered it and paid the sales tax.\n\nDefendant: Yes, but I am willing to do all of that, and that's okay.\n\nJudge: But what do you mean by willing? Because we've been at this for quite some time. You've had the truck for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: August, July or August.\n\nJudge: And you've been unable to register it?\n\nPlaintiff: I can't register it.\n\nJudge: But why did you buy it if that's how the title looked?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t find that out until afterwards.\n\nJudge: Not until you went to register it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Wait. You hadn't looked at the title for the car that you bought?\n\nPlaintiff: No, I looked at the title, and it had his name.\n\nJudge: Well, you didn't look at it and notice that it was filled?\n\nPlaintiff: I did notice it, and then when I went to my insurance company, they said, \"No, his name has to be the seller.\"\n\nJudge: Yes, honey, I know. I'm wondering why you, a grown man, didn't look at the title and say, \"Wait…\" You didn't have an inkling that there was something wrong with it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Until you went to register it. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: They tell me, \"What are you talking about? I can't do it.\"\n\nJudge: Right. So then you call him. And what does he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"Oh, I'll try and get the title for you.\"\n\nPlaintiff: And it's taken, I don't know, six to eight months, and he hasn't got it. I got a text saying, \"Oh, the title will be in any day now.\" Nothing.\n\nPlaintiff: So he said, \"Well, bring the car out.\"\n\nJudge: That’s a $250 tow, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So tell me about that. At one point, he says, \"For me to get you a clean title to a car I sold you months ago, you need to get the car over to—\"\n\nPlaintiff: I brought it to a dealership to have them give it an inspection so he could get a title for it. That’s what he told me.\n\nJudge: Okay. And why did it have to be towed?\n\nPlaintiff: You can't register uninsured.\n\nJudge: Wow, you’re a careful person. I'm not sure what I would have done. I might have just driven it. So you tow it?\n\nPlaintiff: I tow it there. They gave it the inspection. I brought it back home, waiting on him.\n\nPlaintiff: After the 60 days, he called me again and said, \"Well, we gotta bring it back there and do it again.\"\n\nJudge: Why? What do you mean, after the 60 days?\n\nPlaintiff: There was actually a lot more than 60 days in between that time frame.\n\nJudge: That’s not good for you.\n\nJudge: Why are you selling cars that you do not have title to?\n\nDefendant: All right. So I got this truck through an estate when my grandfather passed away. I was given the truck by my aunt, and it's been a complete nightmare. I wish I never even took the truck.\n\nDefendant: And basically, I got the title from my aunt, and it was originally in my brother’s name. My aunt had put my brother there.\n\nJudge: Why? Did she mean to give it to your brother?\n\nDefendant: No, and that’s why I have a letter stating that she did not mean to give it to my brother. She just got confused.\n\nJudge: But what I don’t understand is, you're selling the car, so you're looking at the title a little more carefully than he is. You know that you got a car that you didn’t register, and you know that there's a consequence of that because when you register it, you're supposed to pay taxes. And so you didn’t pay the taxes, and then you sold the car that way.\n\nJudge: How did you figure he was going to register that car?\n\nDefendant: I am exempt from paying taxes on that vehicle. I have a gift form from—\n\nJudge: Except for you didn’t execute any of this, did you? You didn’t take care of all that before selling the car, did you?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: You didn't. Just answer. We all know the answer before you say it. You didn’t take care of it before selling the car, right?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Right. That’s kind of when you’re supposed to.\n\nJudge: Okay, I am ordering you to return to the plaintiff the $1,200 he paid for the truck as well as the $250 that he had to pay just to get your problem solved.

{"id": "954", "dialogue": "Judge:\nGermaine Miller, you are suing Damian Gordon, your former friend, for $950 that you say he owes you for speakers, correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nYes, ma'am.\n\nJudge:\nAnd you are counterclaiming $2,659 for speaker stands and wires, as well as defamation of character?\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nYes, I am.\n\nJudge:\nWhat's going on?\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nI’m a promoter, and he’s a promoter as well. We both work for Club 504 in Brooklyn. Before I met Mr. Gordon, Mr. Gilmore, who is a DJ, told me that he and Mr. Gordon were friends and knew locations and stuff for parties. Mr. Gilmore asked me if I would work with Mr. Gordon. So when I moved in at the club, I had everything—speakers, liquor, and everything for the club because it was basically an empty spot, and you just bring your speakers, tripods, lights, and liquor.\n\nJudge:\nYou bring the liquor?\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nYes, they have a liquor license. It’s not just like bootlegging the liquor. He does parties there often, so I met the owner through Mr. Gordon.\n\nAt the time, I had three speakers, and I don’t know anything about music. The three speakers I had blew out. Mr. Gordon told me that he had some speakers on layaway, and I said okay. We decided not to fix the old speakers and just get new ones. He said we should get new speakers.\n\nJudge:\nWere you going to get the speakers, or was he?\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nHe told me that he made some down payments on the speakers, and I said okay. One day, Mr. Gordon, Mr. Gilmore, and I went to the store. Mr. Gordon went to the store owner and asked for his speakers. Before we got there, Mr. Gordon told us that I was going to spend a few bucks on two speakers. When we got to the store, we actually paid for three speakers, three tripods, two tripods, a mixer, and some wires.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nYes, we bought three speakers, not just two. And we paid for them.\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nWhen we were at the counter, Mr. Gordon told me that whenever the club made money, he would repay me for the speakers. I paid 450 in cash, and 141 on a credit card.\n\nJudge:\nDid you see the transaction?\n\nWitness (Mr. Gilmore):\nYes, I did. I saw him hand over cash, and I saw the rest paid on the credit card.\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nSo, after we left Club 504, Mr. Gordon and I took our stuff. Mr. Gordon took the liquor, and I took the speakers and tripods to my house. Later, in May 2023, Mr. Gordon and I went to a dance studio in Manhattan. The party was a failure, and we lost money. That night, we booked a cab, sent everything, including the speakers, to Mr. Evans’ house.\n\nJudge:\nWho’s Mr. Evans?\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nMr. Evans is a guy who works at the door of the club. He also is where I stay. One day, I told Mr. Gordon to go pick up his liquor from Mr. Evans' house. But Mr. Evans called me one day and told me that Mr. Gordon had taken the speakers, and Mr. Gordon said they were his speakers.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nThat’s because the liquor wasn’t being protected. I took the speakers for safekeeping.\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nBut the speakers didn’t belong to you!\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nI had the receipts for the speakers!\n\nJudge:\nDo you have proof that you paid?\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nYes, I do.\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nI didn’t see him pay, and when I asked him to pay, he didn’t.\n\nJudge:\nThe defendant is saying he took the speakers for safekeeping because of the missing liquor, but the plaintiff says the speakers are his.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nI wasn’t short of money. I had money that day. I wasn’t short.\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nI’m suing for $1,000—the amount owed for the speakers. Also, because of this, I had to rent speakers from someone else, costing me $300.\n\nJudge:\nThe counterclaim is for $2,659. That’s for the speaker stands, wires, and defamation of character. Why are you suing for defamation?\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nHe’s telling people that I stole his speakers, but they’re my speakers.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s not a defamation claim. The fact is, the defendant took the speakers, according to his own admission. He’s also trying to make it seem like he was doing the plaintiff a favor by taking them for safekeeping.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nI took the speakers for safekeeping because the liquor wasn’t being protected.\n\nJudge:\nBut you didn’t have the right to take the speakers. They were not your property to take.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nI should have waited until the plaintiff showed up, but I didn’t. I had to take the speakers for my own protection.\n\nJudge:\nI find in favor of the plaintiff for $511, and the counterclaim is dismissed.\n\nJudge:\nThe plaintiff has two credible witnesses, and the defendant’s testimony is inconsistent. The defendant is not credible, and that’s why the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nDefendant (Damian Gordon):\nIt’s all lies! Those are my speakers!\n\nPlaintiff (Germaine Miller):\nThey were always my speakers!\n\nJudge:\nThe case is over. Judgment is for the plaintiff for $511, and the counterclaim is dismissed.

What was the transaction between the two of you that went so sour?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nHe’s actually the middleman in this case. I first saw the car on Craigslist. I met with the young lady who owned the car and then found out she actually worked with her father, who’s a car dealer, and I met him the next day about the vehicle.\n\nJudge:\nWhat’s her father’s name?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nWick Berto.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you talked to him about the car. What car was it?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nIt was a 2003 Nissan 350Z, a little sports car.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how much was the price?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nWe settled on $5,500 for the car.\n\nJudge:\nSo what happened next?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nI didn’t have the full amount, so I wanted to finance the car.\n\nJudge:\nHow does Joe Massina get involved?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nThe mutual friend, Wick Berto, called Joe Massina and asked if he could help get a customer financed for the car. So, I went to him for help with the financing.\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nYes, that’s correct. I got a call from Wick Berto asking if I would help get the customer financed. I agreed and charged a $500 fee for that service.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so you get paid $500, and John Davis came to your office. What happened next?\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nJohn came in with the information. He had bad credit, so I submitted his application to a company that could handle subprime clients. He was approved for financing. Everything seemed okay. He handed me a $1,000 deposit.\n\nJudge:\nWas that deposit refundable?\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nThe deposit wasn’t refundable because we did everything required. He signed the contract. The car was processed, registered, and a GPS unit was installed as required by the lender.\n\nJudge:\nSo what happened after that?\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nA few days later, Wick Berto calls and tells me that John is returning the car. He couldn’t afford the insurance. I was told to cancel the contract. I contacted the lending company, and they agreed to cancel the loan.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nYeah, I returned the car because I realized I couldn’t afford the insurance on the vehicle. It was a sports car, and the rates were too high for me to manage.\n\nJudge:\nSo you’re telling me you want your deposit back, but the problem is, you never checked how much the insurance would cost before putting down the deposit.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nI didn’t realize it would be so expensive, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nSo why did you give a deposit in the first place?\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nI was excited about the car. I didn’t think about the insurance until after.\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nLook, I did my job. I got him the financing. We registered the car, installed the GPS, and did everything required. The deposit is non-refundable unless you have something in writing that says it is.\n\nJudge:\nSo, you handed over $1,000 to buy a car without realizing how much the insurance would cost. When you change your mind, you want the deposit back, but that’s not how deposits work. You are the one who made the decision to put down the money, and they did everything they were supposed to do. Unless there’s something in writing that says the deposit is refundable, it’s not.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nBut I didn’t know about the insurance, Your Honor!\n\nJudge:\nThat’s your responsibility to figure out beforehand. It’s not the defendant’s fault.

I take great pride in my reputation. This is damaging to my business, and I don’t appreciate being dragged into this.\n\nJudge:\nI’m dismissing your counterclaim as well. You’ve won, and that’s enough. Good luck, folks.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nIt wasn’t that easy for her.

Simple.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nIt was simple for her.\n\nDefendant (Joe):\nIt was simple.\n\nPlaintiff (John):\nI didn’t get a chance to speak.\n\nJudge:\nWell, the truth is, you made a bad decision, and now you’re trying to make someone else pay for your mistake.

{"id": "230", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, Ms. Janeski, you are suing Ms. Despo for $725, the cost that you paid for a home inspection on the sale of a home where she ended up backing out of it. Correct?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): What happened? Well, in early summer, I began looking for a home for my daughter.\n\nJudge: And you were going to buy it for her?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. She had just gone through a divorce.\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes. I wanted it in this specific complex, and I was taken to the defendant’s condominium that was for sale. I looked at it a couple of times. I made her an offer to purchase, a written offer to purchase. I paid the fee that goes with the binder.\n\nJudge: And that’s a deposit on the sale?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Correct.\n\nJudge: And you signed a binder?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): I signed a binder, which is essentially a contract agreeing to sign a contract later.\n\nJudge: Correct.\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Correct. And we negotiated back and forth for several weeks before we came up to a final price. She signed the binder back on October 4th. After that, I had the binder in hand. The only condition that I had was a home inspection and radon test. I retained a home inspector who did the home inspection.\n\nJudge: And that person charged you $725?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Correct.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipt for that?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): I do.\n\nJudge: Can I see that?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes, you may.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): I assume your daughter was all excited.\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes.\n\nJudge: Was she going to live there alone or with her two children?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Her two children. My grandchildren.\n\nJudge: And was it near you?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): It was very close to me.\n\nJudge: And several days later when I got the inspection back, I called my broker and I said, \"You know, I’m ready to move forward,\" and the inspection was alright.\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes.\n\nJudge: And around the 18th of October, I got a call from my broker that the seller was not going to sell the condo, and she wasn’t going through with the deal. And this is what, October of last year?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): Yes, 2011.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): What she said is true, Your Honor. I had the condo up for sale. I had to get out. I was a single parent. I had two teenagers living at home, so I wanted everybody out. I wanted them to become responsible, move on.\n\nJudge: When you say teenagers, I assume you mean over 18?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): Over 18, yes.\n\nJudge: Exactly. Get out! You 13-year-olds—how old are they?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): They needed to go. But they didn’t have their apartments. Nobody was ready to go at that point. My contingency was that the house sold as-is.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): Okay. And I asked my realtor, \"Look, do I still have time to back out because my kids aren’t set? I’m not set.\" I had some other issues I was dealing with. But why were you backing out? You had a realtor, you negotiated, you put it up for sale, somebody bit, you negotiated, and you signed a binder. Don’t you think?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): Yep.\n\nJudge: And then I got—I didn’t sign it.\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): The original offer was made in August, what happened between August and October? There was negotiations.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): On the price. Back and forth.\n\nJudge: Okay, what happened?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): Then at that time I wasn’t even going to go with it.\n\nJudge: Alright. Binders have always thrown me for a loop anyway because they’re not—it’s sort of the concept is sort of weird. However, let’s look at the binder in this case, and they are, you know, enforceable to some extent. Did you hand me the binder?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): All right.\n\nJudge: In the binder, it says there are three conditions: one is that the contract of sale are to be signed, and the balance of the deposit is to be made before September 4th. Two was scratched out, which is financing, and three was an inspection. But was there a date—did you have like 10 days to do an inspection? How did that work?\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): I believe it had to be done within seven days.\n\nJudge: Yeah, all right. In any event, in every binder, the intent of the parties is that there’s going to be another contract. That this isn’t all she wrote—that there’s going to be something else. However, that doesn’t mean, if the binder means nothing, then why sign it and why call it a binder? At a minimum, it always has to mean that you’re not going to sell it to somebody else while the binder is in effect. At a minimum, it’s going to mean that you have to hand over the money the binder talks about. Well, what else does it mean?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): I believe that in the circumstances of this case, at a minimum, it means that there’s going to be some good faith sitting at a table because you’ve agreed to agree. You pulled out completely for whatever reasons that you had, and that’s fine. What I don’t understand is why you wouldn’t attempt to recompense her for the money she totally wasted by you pulling out because you know that she had a bill. Did she ever send you the bill? Did anybody ever ask you to pay for the bill, or did you just get sued?\n\nDefendant (Barbara Despo): No. Once I backed out, my realtor called me and said, \"Barbara, they’re going to sue you.\" So I said, “Okay, they’re going to sue me.” So I was waiting for something to come, and then the lawsuit came. Yeah, and then nothing came until my house was just sold, now, like a month ago, and then I guess when they found out I sold the house, it rekindled old memories. So they figured, okay.\n\nPlaintiff (Janet Janeski): So then I finally got the thing in the mail. So I wasn’t—I was going to, you know, try to do the right thing, and yet you’re here.\n\nJudge: Okay. So I find in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of the $725 plus your court costs. Thank you.

Now she has a smashed car, no money, and is suing the defendant for the $800 she gave him.\n\nJudge: This is the defendant, Angel Suarez. He says the plaintiff, his sister-in-law, canceled the order for the repair work to be done after he'd already ordered the parts.

He's accused of not fixing it.\n\n[Music]\n\nJudge: Good. All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff was involved in a hit and run. The defendant promised to fix it but didn't. The defendant says the plaintiff, who is his sister-in-law, did some funny business with the parts. It's the case of \"I Hit That.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas. Okay, Shawn Dale Tatum, you are suing Angel Suarez for $800 that you say he owes you in parts that you'd ordered with him, but he never fixed your car. According to you, she tried to change her mind on the deal, and the parts have already been purchased. Let me hear from you first.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, um, my car was in an accident. I was hit on my front passenger side.\n\nJudge: Okay, and he fixed the car?\n\nPlaintiff: He came over—\n\nJudge: How do you know him?\n\nPlaintiff: He's my husband's brother.\n\nJudge: He's your husband's brother? Why were you calling him a friend in the—\n\nPlaintiff: Well, because he's my husband's friend, but they've known each other for a while, so they consider each other family.\n\nJudge: Okay. Are you brothers or are you not brothers?\n\nDefendant: They're not related. They're not actually brothers, just friends.\n\nJudge: You grew up together?\n\nDefendant: We said that we were brothers.\n\nJudge: In the same household?\n\nDefendant: No, in the same neighborhood.\n\nJudge: How big a neighborhood is this?\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so it’s a close friend of his.\n\nJudge: And then what? You—you know him?\n\nPlaintiff: I met him through my husband, yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, and now your husband ended up in jail?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What is he in jail for?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, drugs.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, was he in jail at the time that you hired him to fix the car?\n\nPlaintiff: No, he was out.\n\nJudge: Who does the hiring—him or you?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, I spoke with Angel, and we agreed that he would fix my car for me.\n\nJudge: All right. Do you give him any money?\n\nPlaintiff: Um, at that time, no. He just came over, he looked at the car, he told me what we were going to need to purchase for the car.\n\nJudge: Now, are you a repairman? Are you a bodyman? What are you?\n\nDefendant: No, a friend of mine owns a mechanic shop and a body shop. So she asked me to come and check out the car. I said, all right, no problem.\n\nJudge: Why? Just because you know a guy who knows what he's doing?\n\nDefendant: I—I—I do mechanic work.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant: But a friend of mine owns a body shop right next door to the shop that we had.\n\nJudge: Were you going to do the mechanic work and he was going to do the body work?\n\nDefendant: Yes, correct.\n\nJudge: And do you have a job, or you don't?\n\nDefendant: No, I do. I help my stepfather at the shop at the mechanic—\n\nJudge: Is this the shop we're talking about?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: That was—oh, that’s your—a friend of mine or your stepfather?\n\nDefendant: No, my step—no, no, no. The body shop is a friend. The mechanic shop is my stepfather's.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, you tell her, \"I can help you out and get you a good price.\"\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you folks agree on what?\n\nDefendant: I told her parts were going to run her $800.\n\nJudge: How much did she pay you for parts?\n\nDefendant: She gave me—first, she gave me $450. She, I think, Western Union money-granted it to me, and then she gave me another amount of $280.\n\nJudge: Does that sound right?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: How much do you say you gave?\n\nPlaintiff: I wired $450, right? And then $300 on another day.\n\nJudge: Okay. Does that sound familiar?\n\nDefendant: No. She—totally, she gave me $280.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, do you have a receipt?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Okay. Well, that's where we are on that one—without a receipt. All right, now let’s move on from that fact and let’s talk about what actually happens. This is the end of February. You take the car?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: So, you're waiting for the parts to come?\n\nDefendant: No, the parts were already there. Then she calls me. Before she gave me the money, I ordered the parts for her. She tells me she didn’t want to do it.\n\nJudge: How long after telling you did she say that?\n\nDefendant: I ordered the parts that same day. Me and her discussed it, I ordered the parts. She comes and tells me that she doesn't want to do the car the following day.\n\nJudge: Okay. So, it's back and forth—\"I want the car fixed, I don’t want the car fixed.\" We already had the parts in the shop. So, I tell the guy, \"Listen, she wants the money back.\" But he goes, \"You guys are playing games going back and forth with these parts. I can't get my money back.\"\n\nJudge: Okay. Now, I need you to prove exactly what you just said. Do you have the guy here to testify?\n\nDefendant: No, I don’t.\n\nJudge: Do you have the receipts to prove that you bought parts?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Now, why do you get to change your mind?

Uh, auto mechanic toolbox—bottom, top, side cabinet, and a rolling cabinet.\n\nJudge: Okay, and why couldn’t you carry it yourself?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Why couldn’t you?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, because it’s too heavy.\n\nJudge: How much does it weigh?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I would say close to 2,000 lbs.\n\nJudge: Okay, so it’s—how big with your hands is this unit?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, it’s about 3 feet wide.\n\nJudge: Uh-huh.\n\nPlaintiff: And 5 feet tall.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And it was full of tools.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: All right.

And what do you do?\n\nPlaintiff: Uh, I wheel the tools outside to the back of the flatbed.\n\nJudge: The toolbox?\n\nPlaintiff: The toolbox.\n\nJudge: And he’s supposed to pick them up? Pull them up?\n\nPlaintiff: How is he going to pick it up and put it on?\n\nJudge: Well, roll it up. He has a cable that he hooks to the toolbox and he pulls it up onto the flatbed.\n\nPlaintiff: So there would be a ramp?\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff: He has a ramp.\n\nJudge: It’s a flatbed.\n\nPlaintiff: So what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: First thing happened—I saw that the ramp that he had had about a 3-inch lip on it.\n\nJudge: Why would he have a lip on the ramp? The whole point of a ramp is to make it smooth.\n\nPlaintiff: That I don’t know why.\n\nJudge: All right. So he has a lip. And what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: He grabs the chain. He wraps it around one wheel and he’s trying to pull it.\n\nJudge: What do you mean he wraps it around one wheel?\n\nPlaintiff: The bottom section of the tool chest has four wheels on the bottom of it. He takes the cable with the hook and he wraps it around the wheel instead of putting a strap around the whole box and pulling it up that way.\n\nJudge: Just pulling by one wheel?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah. He’s pulling it by one wheel.\n\nJudge: Why are you letting him do that if you’re standing there?\n\nPlaintiff: I did.\n\nJudge: Did you say anything or no?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Said like what?\n\nPlaintiff: \"What are you doing here? You know what I mean? Everything is bending here and stuff like that.\"\n\nJudge: He goes?\n\nPlaintiff: \"Oh, don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it.\"\n\nJudge: He says?\n\nPlaintiff: And what—\n\nJudge: Well, I said—\n\nPlaintiff: \"You have to lift it up.\"\n\nJudge: Sorry, you said what?\n\nPlaintiff: \"You have to lift it up.\"\n\nJudge: Because?\n\nPlaintiff: \"You have to lift it up.\" Because he wanted me to lift it up.\n\nJudge: So you lifted it up with him?\n\nPlaintiff: I tried to.\n\nJudge: Just press the \"L\" for me and I’ll lift it up?\n\nPlaintiff: \"You have to lift it up.\" Just like an inch.\n\nJudge: So there is a lip?\n\nPlaintiff: All right.\n\nJudge: It up. And then he gets it on the flatbed.\n\nJudge: And do you drive to the place he’s bringing it down to, watch and supervise his removal of it?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Why not?\n\nPlaintiff: I had asked him that. I said—I had somewhere to go. I said, \"Do you need somebody to go? Do you need me to go with you to unload it?\"\n\nJudge: He goes?\n\nPlaintiff: \"No, no problem. I’ll just unload it off the flatbed and I’ll have someone just bring it inside.\"\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So I said, \"Call me to let me know.\" Because now the wheel is bent.\n\nJudge: Did you take pictures of the bent wheel?\n\nPlaintiff: Oh, yeah.\n\nJudge: No, I don’t mean like at that moment because you were so mad because the wheel was bent.\n\nPlaintiff: No, I did not.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I did not, because I was starting work on Monday and this is Saturday. So I need to get this thing down to my new job that I’m starting.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo he gets the Box up on the flatbed, and instead of tying it down left to right, side to side, he ties it down front to back.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo now the whole—then he puts his big tie strap, like those big straps that you ratchet, and the whole top of the box is bending. And I'm watching the wheels start to bend instead of making it go front to back—I mean side to side—and strapping it down on the strong points of the box. He straps it down on the weak points of the box.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So he gets the other box up. What did you have to do that was so important that you don’t want to watch this clown unload it on the other side?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause from what you're describing, he could be nothing short of a clown.\n\nJudge:\nSo if that’s true, and all this terrible stuff is happening, does your telephone take video and pictures?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. Why wouldn’t you take video and pictures of it? And why wouldn’t you be saying, \"You know what? I’m going to cancel.\" What was it you had to do?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI had to get my tools back.\n\nJudge:\nNo, where was it you had to be?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI had to be at my grandson’s football game.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nSo.\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe’s five. His first football—\n\nJudge:\nFive. His first football game.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nYou—peewee football. That’s what you were doing?\n\nPlaintiff:\nPeewee football.\n\nJudge:\nAll right. So what do you hear happens? You start calling him to make sure everything’s okay, and what happens?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBefore I left, I told him, I said, “Kevin, I said just let me know how you made out.”\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nMeaning that I wanted to make sure that the box got there in one piece.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I get back into the car—I left my phone in the car, my wife and I—and I got two phone calls from him that I missed.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo my wife texted him back.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd nothing. Two times.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo then I texted him back. I says, \"Why are you ignoring me?\" I said to him, \"I just want to know how you made out with my toolbox. You know what I mean? Like, did it get there in one piece or what?\"\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo he says, \"It got there.\" That’s what he said. And that was it.\n\nJudge:\nDid he say anything went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. But then you go on Monday morning—\n\nPlaintiff:\nExactly.\n\nJudge:\n—to work, and what do you find?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAs soon as I got at work, okay, some guy comes up to me, and he was like right there. This guy Steve. And he goes, \"Dude, the guy that dropped your tools off, the whole box fell off the truck.\"\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAnd I'm like, \"Whoa.\"\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo then I walked to my toolbox and everything, and I’m seeing it’s like twisted and bent and whatever. I’m saying like, \"Wow.\" You can see the pictures.\n\nJudge:\nAnd he’s mad at me now?\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe’s mad at me.\n\nJudge:\nThe football player?\n\nDefendant:\nIt’s 2,000 pounds—\n\nJudge:\nHold on, sir. Nobody asked you a question. Is that the football player?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff:\nThat’s—that’s the joy of my life.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSay—repeat that last part.\n\nJudge:\nHe’s the joy of your life?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo. Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so the guy did not see the damage occur. Is he out of luck?\n\nDefendant:\nHe is.\n\nJudge:\nWhy?\n\nDefendant:\nI just think it’s unfortunate that he was in that circumstance and the dude didn’t trust him.\n\nJudge:\nWell, so how do you protect yourself?\n\nDefendant:\nI would take pictures with my phone before—\n\nJudge:\nYeah. That is the point. Going inside the courtroom.\n\nJudge:\nYou said that one of the other employees said—\n\nPlaintiff:\nHe told me that the box fell over on its side. He had to help him pick the box back up.\n\nJudge:\nDid that happen?\n\nDefendant:\nIt’s not a new unit.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nDefendant:\nThis unit was passed on to you by who?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, no. I bought it brand new. My grandfather bought it for me when I first started in the business.\n\nJudge:\nSo that was how old?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nYeah?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThirty years ago?\n\nJudge:\nTwenty-five years ago?\n\nPlaintiff:\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nSo this thing is now—the drawer won’t close.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo here I am at work on Monday, and I’m trying to—I have to take everything out of the box because all the tools are upside down. They’re all laying in the bottom of the lower box.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I’m trying to open up the bottom box—\n\nJudge:\nThis is fresh damage right here.\n\nPlaintiff:\nSo I’m trying to open up the bottom drawers on a toolbox.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nPlaintiff:\nI had to drill out the—\n\nJudge:\nThis is fresh damage.\n\nDefendant:\nWhether it’s fresh or not, I didn’t do it. He’s just claiming I did it.\n\nJudge:\nYeah, he is.\n\nDefendant:\nHe’s claiming I did it.\n\nJudge:\nBut apparently, he’s not the only one claiming you did it.\n\nDefendant:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\nAccording to you, nothing happened. It didn’t fall over. Nothing happened.\n\nDefendant:\nThe only thing that fell was the top box because it’s not connected. That’s what I told the officer when he called me with the police report. Only the top box fell.\n\nJudge:\nShow me the police report.\n\nDefendant:\nIt’s not connected.\n\nJudge:\nDid they make you come to the place, or no, they just talked to you on the phone?\n\nDefendant:\nThey just talked to me on the phone.\n\nJudge:\nShow me the police report.\n\nJudge:\nSo the police called you, and you told them that only the top box fell?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nBut you never told the plaintiff that, correct?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nWhy not?\n\nDefendant:\nBecause he was already texting me like crazy, and I figured he’d just blame me anyway.\n\nJudge:\nWell, don’t you think he had the right to know?\n\nDefendant:\nI mean, I guess, but the box was old.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s not the issue here. The issue is whether or not the damage occurred because of how you transported it.\n\nPlaintiff:\nExactly.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any pictures of the toolbox before transport?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I do.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see them.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over photos.)\n\nJudge:\nOkay. This shows a toolbox in good condition. Do you have any pictures of how it looked when it arrived?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, I do.\n\n(Plaintiff hands over another set of photos.)\n\nJudge:\nOh wow. This is significantly bent.\n\nDefendant:\nThat could have been like that before.\n\nJudge:\nNo, because I see pictures of it before transport. It was fine. Then after transport, it’s completely bent, drawers don’t close, and it’s clearly damaged.\n\nDefendant:\nWell, I didn’t mean for that to happen.\n\nJudge:\nThat’s not how liability works. If you’re responsible for transporting something, you are responsible for making sure it gets there safely.\n\n(Judge looks over police report.)\n\nJudge:\nThe police report confirms that the top part of the box fell during transport, but based on the testimony of the plaintiff’s coworker, it looks like the entire unit fell.\n\n(Judge looks at damage estimate.)\n\nJudge:\nYou’re suing for how much?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$2,500 for a replacement toolbox.\n\nJudge:\nAnd how old was this toolbox?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAbout 25 to 30 years old, but in good condition.\n\nJudge:\nYou can’t get the value of a brand-new toolbox for an older one. However, you are entitled to the fair market value of a similar used one in good condition.\n\n(Judge checks estimated value.)\n\nJudge:\nI’m going to award the plaintiff $1,500. That is a reasonable replacement cost based on similar used toolboxes in good condition.\n\nDefendant:\nThat’s not fair.\n\nJudge:\nIt is fair. You were responsible for the transport, you improperly secured the load, and as a result, it was damaged. Judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $1,500.\n\nBailiff:\nCourt is adjourned.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization, deflection, dismissal"}

The defendant said she would come out and investigate the damage but never did, and here they are.

She says she did indeed investigate the plaintiff's bogus claim, and there's no way one of her buses did the damage because it's on a spot where none of her buses could even get to. This woman is trying to place the blame on one of her drivers when he did nothing wrong, and there's no way she's going to pay for damage that wasn't caused by her bus. She's accused of causing a crater.\n\nAll parties, please rise.\n\nWelcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket: the plaintiff says the defendant’s bus drove over a curb and left a huge hole in the cement, but the defendant says no way did her bus do the damage. It's the case of Bus-Ted. Litigants have been sworn in, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** Thank you, Douglas. Kathy Mourich, you are suing Karen Holzwarth and K&H Bus Service. You're the owner?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, for $540, the cost of pavement repair, because according to you, one of her drivers was negligent. Tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay. Um, on November 10th of last year, when I was coming home from work, I said, \"Oh my God, my neighbor’s really going to be ticked. Somebody broke his pavement!\" And here it was mine. And I was ticked. And I went—I went into the corner store to find out if they knew what had happened because they had cameras, right? And the—the gentleman that was the proprietor at the time said, \"Yes, the school bus pulled on your pavement.\"\n\n**Judge:** Oh, so he had actually seen it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes.\n\n**Judge:** Is he here today?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No.\n\n**Judge:** All right. But you have the pictures from his surveillance footage?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, let's see the pictures.\n\n**Judge:** So you find out who the company is from these pictures?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, from the actual video. My niece and her daughter and I went in to view the cameras, and you could see—you could see K&H School Bus Service or whatever it was on the side.\n\n**Judge:** Yes, you can. Oh, you're not going to be happy. Did you speak to the driver?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I did, Your Honor.\n\n**Judge:** And what did your driver say?\n\n**Plaintiff:** He said, \"I parked on the curb.\" He says, \"I didn’t go no further than the curb.\"\n\n**Judge:** So is it possible, or do you believe that the bus parked on the curb but didn’t jump the curb?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, absolutely not. I think it had to have jumped the curb.\n\n**Judge:** What do you say?\n\n**Defendant:** I don’t think there’s any way that he could have just parked on the curb after, like, not doing it on purpose, basically.\n\n**Judge:** Right, right, right. Going inside the courtroom—what does \"curb\" mean?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh, well, in Philadelphia, when we have our houses, the pavements are actually what they call cement slabs.\n\n**Judge:** Yeah, okay.\n\n**Plaintiff:** And the curb would be just a long piece of curbing, which would not be cement. It would be other than cement.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so is it part of the street?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yeah, it divides the street from the actual sidewalk.\n\n**Judge:** And what is the curb made of?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Could be slate. I think most of them are slate. I don’t believe it's cement.\n\n**Judge:** Would you like to see what the bus driver did?\n\n**Defendant:** Yes, I would love to.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Why didn’t you just send her this picture?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, I did speak with Ms.—\n\n**Judge:** No, no. This is different from sending the picture. A picture is worth a— I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I show her the picture. Why would you not have sent her the picture? When did you get the picture?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I—I don’t remember when I actually took—\n\n**Judge:** When did you get it? You helping her?\n\n**Plaintiff’s Niece:** Um, I was with her at the corner store, but it was a few days after when they were able to get the pictures off of the video surveillance.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so a few days after.

Take that picture to that nice lady right there. Pretty bad, right?\n\n**Defendant:** Actually, what she was com—what she said was up here was broken—\n\n**Judge:** Where it's caved in?\n\n**Defendant:** Except that’s not accurate.

{"id": "73", "dialogue": "Judge: Nicole Reason and Kirby Gaston, you are suing Natalie Jean, your landlord, for forty-five hundred dollars that you want returned to you—the two months' rent you paid, the security deposit, and the dog deposit—because, according to you, she didn't have a right to lease to you to begin with. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): Well, um, one day my husband called me and told me he found this apartment on this website that's called classyapartment.com. On the website, it said \"apartment for rent for thirteen hundred, call ASAP.\" My husband called her, he went to see the apartment. The following day I went with him. I seen the apartment. I said, \"You know what? I like the apartment.\" Basically, we're going to go ahead with it. January 1st, we gave a total deposit of 4400, and the third, we gave her an additional hundred dollars, so that made it a whole total of 4,500.\n\nJudge: Okay. Did you sign a lease?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see the lease you signed?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): This is for chicken.\n\nJudge: Do you have the actual lease?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): This is everything that she gave.\n\nJudge: Okay. So she actually gave you a picture?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): No, no, no. Okay, that's a picture of something. Do you have the something?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): I just brought the copies.\n\nJudge: Yeah, never do that. Always bring an original, which is much easier to read than a picture. All right. So it says move in—blah, blah, blah—this will be a month-to-month. So it was month-to-month. All right. Now, what's this other document you gave me a picture of?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): That is a document that she forged the landlord’s name on.\n\nJudge: That you never met the landlord?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): No, I never met the landlord.\n\nJudge: Who is Antoine Sanders?\n\nPlaintiff (Nicole Reason): The landlord. He's right here.\n\nJudge: Okay. Can you switch with him, please?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Yes.\n\nJudge: All right. According to you, do you have a lease with the landlord?\n\nDefendant (Natalie Jean): Yes.\n\nJudge: May I see your lease? You are the landlord? You're the owner of the property?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Yes, I am.\n\nJudge: All right. So now, how long have you been renting to her?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): I never gave her a lease.\n\nJudge: How long have you been renting to her?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): I've never rented to her. The place—I don't know what you're talking—I never rented an apartment in my house.\n\nJudge: So how is she living there?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Her friend used to live there. Her friend moved out, and she moved in.\n\nJudge: Okay, so she moved in without your authority?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Show me the lease. Does it have your name on it or somebody else's?\n\nDefendant (Natalie Jean): My name.\n\nJudge: Take a look at that. Is that your signature and her signature? Because it looks like a lease.\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): This is not my signature.\n\nJudge: That's not your signature?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Definitely not.\n\nJudge: Do you have any ID on you right now?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Yes.\n\nJudge: Pull out any ID that has your signature, please.\n\nJudge: Did you forge it?\n\nDefendant (Natalie Jean): No.\n\nJudge: You've been to court with her already, right?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Yes.\n\nJudge: Why did you go to court?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Because she didn't want to leave when I told her to.\n\nJudge: Why were you trying to get her out?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): Because she's not supposed to be there.\n\nJudge: Yeah, but I mean, don't you want some—was she paying rent?\n\nPlaintiff (Antoine Sanders): No, she wasn't.\n\nJudge: Oh, well, that's a good reason.

{"id": "233", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hands. Welcome back to The People’s Court. Next case on the docket—the plaintiff helped the defendant find two kittens, and the defendant won’t pay the adoption fee. But the defendant says there was never an adoption fee agreement. It’s the case of Kitty Galore.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Douglas.\n\nBailiff: You're welcome.\n\nJudge: Okay, Mary Chirichella, you are suing Here Kitty Kitty Incorporated, represented here by Leslie Diamond. You're the president?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. For $180, the amount that you say they owe you as an adoption fee for two kittens, right? That they received and kept rather than giving to you the adoption fee. All right, so tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay. In July of 20__, I rescued two tortoiseshell kittens.\n\nJudge: Where did you rescue them from?\n\nPlaintiff: From a street in a busy area.\n\nJudge: Okay, and were they kittens at the time?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, they were about 10 to 12 weeks old. It was a location where I’d been doing cat rescue for 12 years, so I had been feeding in that area. I first saw one kitten, and then saw the other one a few days later. A friend of mine, Eileen, agreed to foster them. I provided the food and litter to Eileen, and she took care of them daily. Then I created a flyer for Natasha and Nadia. My phone number was on there, and Eileen and I posted the flyer at various locations. It was a slow summer, the economic crisis was in full swing, and I wasn’t getting the kind of calls I was happy with for them.\n\nJudge: What kind of donation were you looking for?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, originally, just to cover my expenses.\n\nJudge: So what was it for the two of them?\n\nPlaintiff: At the time, I would have even taken $75 for both. At that time, they only had one vet visit, which was $131.\n\nJudge: So you wanted $75 for both of them?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. It was very slow going. When Eileen had gone to the vet, someone there suggested that she could take the kittens to Petco on Route 3 and show them on weekends with the group run by Ms. Diamond.\n\nJudge: Do you work for Petco?\n\nDefendant: No, we show our cats and kittens at Petco. I've been doing rescue for 20 years, and Here Kitty Kitty is going to celebrate its 9th anniversary in September.\n\nJudge: All right. So what happens next?\n\nPlaintiff: Eileen brings the kittens over and leaves them with her. A woman completes an application, and I spoke to the woman who wanted to adopt them. Then I spoke with Leslie. I asked her how much she was going to charge for the adoption fee. She said $180. I told her I would need that fee to compensate me for what I had already spent. She asked how much I had spent. I said a few hundred dollars. She said she couldn’t give me that. I told her I didn’t expect that much, but I would need the adoption fee.\n\nDefendant: Nobody talked about the adoption fee before all this happened. Ms. Chirichella knew what our adoption fee was. The people who adopted the cats were in their 60s, so we have a program sponsored through Purina that pays the adoption fee for two cats. Then Mary came on the scene and said she wanted the adoption fee after the adoption had already taken place. In all my years of doing this, I sometimes split the fee with someone or write a tax letter.\n\nJudge: So what happens? The cats get adopted, and then what?\n\nPlaintiff: Leslie agreed that she would mail me the adoption fee, but I would have to wait because it was coming from Purina. I said that was fine, I could wait. A few months went by, I suspected something was up, and I called her. She did not return my phone calls. One night, I spoke to her husband, and he said she would get back to me. So I went to see her.\n\nJudge: Why were you avoiding her?\n\nDefendant: I took all her calls. The one night she called, I was very sick, and my husband picked up the phone while I was sleeping.\n\nJudge: According to you, how many messages did you leave?\n\nPlaintiff: Several, at least three.\n\nJudge: So you ended up having to go in person to Petco?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes. As soon as I walked in, Leslie said, \"I don’t have your money.\" I asked why. She said she had some veterinary emergencies and had to use it. I asked when she thought she’d have it, and she said she didn’t know. There was no attempt to work something out or make any payments. She told me, \"If you want your money that badly, take me to court.\" So I said, \"Okay, I will.\"\n\nJudge: You did get paid by Purina?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: At some point, were you telling her you were going to send her the adoption fee?\n\nDefendant: I never actually stated that I would send her the money, and I never signed anything. I said I would try and see what I could do. We survive by adoption fees. That’s it. We don’t get grants like city or state shelters.\n\nJudge: That’s how you operate, and that’s how she operates too. I have to decide if there was a contract between you two. You didn’t set a price, so I have to set a price. I’m going to split it. I’m ordering you to pay her $90. I strongly suggest that if you’re in this situation, specify the money part in advance.

Next case on the docket, the plaintiff says her cousin invited her into a book club, and they were having an event in Florida. The plaintiff says she got kicked out of the club, and now the defendant refuses to return her money. But the defendant says the plaintiff didn’t follow the rules. It’s the case of I Hate You Like the Dickens. Thank you, Douglas.\n\nJudge: Okay, Shade Martin, you are suing your cousin, Karifa Jones, for $240 that you say she owes you to return for a trip that she wouldn’t let you go on. You say she canceled, and that’s her problem—that she lost the money. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so about a year and a half ago, Karifa started a book club. She invited me to join. You know, we meet once a month or so. Around December, the group decided we were going to take our first annual book club trip. It was to go to Florida. So I gave her the money around the last or second week of March for a trip that was going to be in April.\n\nJudge: Okay, April 15th.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, April 15th. Everything was fine after I gave her the money. There were no problems.\n\nJudge: Were you two getting along?\n\nPlaintiff: We were getting along perfectly fine.\n\nJudge: Was everybody here in the book club?\n\nPlaintiff: No, no, no. And yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: The last meeting, I didn’t attend because I wasn’t feeling well. I sent her a text message letting her know. But still, after that, I saw her at my cousin’s dinner—that was April 7th. He had a dinner for his birthday. Me and her spoke, along with her witness. Everything was fine. No problems. The day before the trip, which was April 14th, one of my cousins, Tanisha Williams, called me. She gave me a phone call saying that she would give me my money if she could take my place. I thought she was joking.\n\nJudge: Who is she, and how is she related to her?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s her sister.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: So, I’m thinking she’s joking. I’m like, \"Okay, yeah, yeah, whatever.\"\n\nJudge: Why did you say \"yeah\"? Why didn’t you say, \"No, I’m going\"?\n\nPlaintiff: I started laughing. I told her that, you know, I’m going on the trip. We both laughed it off. I didn’t think that she was serious. Apparently, they were discussing it at my aunt’s salon. My cousin and my aunts were there as well. Not even a minute later, Karifa calls me, saying, \"Oh, how are you going to let someone else take your spot without consulting me?\" And I’m like, \"Well, I didn’t give her permission to take my spot. I didn’t receive any money. I thought we were joking.\"\n\nJudge: Then what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: She calls me and says, \"How are you going to give someone permission to take your spot without consulting me?\" I stated, \"Well, I wasn’t serious. We laughed it off. I thought she was joking.\" She says, \"Well, you’ve been acting funny. You don’t call nobody, so I’m just going to bring you your money back, and that’ll be it. You’re not going to be a part of the book club, and you won’t be attending the trip.\"\n\nJudge: She tells you this verbally?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she does. And as we were talking, I pressed the record button on my phone, so it recorded the call and sent it as a text message.\n\nJudge: Okay, then what?\n\nPlaintiff: After that, I said, \"Okay, fine. No problem.\" I wasn’t going to argue. She said she was bringing my money. I said, \"Fine.\" That was that. I didn’t call or text her until about two or three days after she came back from Florida. I sent her a text asking when she would be available so I could come get my money. She said, \"Well, unfortunately, you won’t be getting your money back because it’s nonrefundable. You decided not to go.\"\n\nJudge: Was there an empty slot on the trip?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay, Karifa, what’s your version?\n\nDefendant: Well, mostly everything she said was true. The book club started, and we had been planning this trip for a long time. I wanted it to be special because this was our first trip as a group. We saw her at our cousin’s dinner, and her response to us wasn’t that warm. She had been acting funny. At my mom’s salon, my sister said she wanted to go on the trip. I told her she couldn’t because it was for book club members only. She called Shade and asked to take her spot, and Shade said \"Yeah.\"\n\nJudge: Did you tell her you’d return her money?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did. I didn’t want bad blood. But she never called us, never arranged anything for the trip.\n\nJudge: Did your sister go on the trip?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Okay, the text message. Can I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, here.\n\nJudge: If you tell her you’re returning her money, then you return her money. You admitted it anyway. You’re suing for $240, but you only gave her $200?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, the $40 is court costs.\n\nJudge: I find in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $200 plus court costs. That’s my judgment.

{"id": "386", "dialogue": "Judge: Darius, you are suing Barbara for $3,779 that you say you gave her to hold for you while you were in prison and she spent on herself. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Darius): Well, Your Honor, I was currently incarcerated, and I received a settlement.\n\nJudge: While you were incarcerated?\n\nPlaintiff: While I was incarcerated, I bailed myself out with the settlement. I worked it out where I posted my bail, and when I was released, I didn’t have any identification. So, as a courtesy from the lawyer who litigated the matter, I asked him to place a check in my niece’s name because she would cash it for me.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: And she placed the check in her account. She cashed it for me.\n\nJudge: How much was the total?\n\nPlaintiff: The total check was $9,779.\n\nJudge: Okay, go on.\n\nPlaintiff: And the day the check cleared, I was remanded again on the same case.\n\nJudge: Wait, I don’t understand. You bailed out, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Then why did they take you back in?\n\nPlaintiff: They took me back in because there was a dispute between an attorney—\n\nJudge: No, no, no. I was a criminal lawyer. I know when people get remanded. Did you pick up another case?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Did you violate the conditions of your bail?\n\nPlaintiff: No.\n\nJudge: Then they can’t just drag a guy back in after he’s posted bail and say, “Yeah, we changed our mind.” That doesn’t happen. What actually happened?\n\nPlaintiff: It happened, Your Honor. And, to go small in depth and in detail of it, I hired an attorney. The attorney went to the appellate division, and the bail was reversed.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: And I could post bail again, but my niece had my money, and she wouldn’t bail me out.\n\nJudge: That doesn’t make any sense. There had to be something else. You had to have violated a condition, or there was a new case filed, or it was a probation violation. Something had to be going on that would allow that. But anyway, let’s move on. So, you gave her $9,779 to hold in her account?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then, do you take any of it for lawyer’s fees?\n\nPlaintiff: I asked my niece to find an attorney for me. She found an attorney for me, and I have a copy of the retainer.\n\nJudge: Not detainer—retainer.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the retainer was how much?\n\nPlaintiff: The retainer was $5,000.\n\nJudge: So that’s how much of the money you have used.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you got a new lawyer. And then, do you end up going to trial?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I ended up going to trial.\n\nJudge: And you got convicted?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What was the charge?\n\nPlaintiff: Possession of stolen property.\n\nJudge: And you ended up going to jail for how long?\n\nPlaintiff: I spent four and a half years.\n\nJudge: Four and a half years. And the first lawyer was trying to get you to take a plea deal?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What was the plea offer?\n\nPlaintiff: One to three years.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you know, don’t feel bad about that because it’s always a gamble. You might have walked. You know your case better than anybody else. You may feel bad about it, maybe you should feel bad about it, I don’t know. But I’m not judging you because everybody’s master of their own destiny.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: All right. So, during that time, the remaining $4,779 is in her account?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And then you get out. What happens?\n\nPlaintiff: During the course of my incarceration, I needed more money for my legal fees for my attorney to go to trial. After the bail was reinstated by the appellate division, a bond could have been posted so I could get back out. The attorney tried several times to reach out to her to bail me out, and we never heard from her again.\n\nJudge: She’s your niece, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she’s my niece.\n\nJudge: How is she your niece?\n\nPlaintiff: She’s my brother’s daughter.\n\nJudge: Right. So when you say you never heard from her—did you call your brother? Did you have the lawyer call your brother?\n\nPlaintiff: My brother is deceased. I wrote everyone I possibly could to try to get her to do something for me—post my bail, help me.\n\nJudge: So what ended up happening?\n\nPlaintiff: After I was released, I came home and asked for my money. She gave me $1,000 of the money.\n\nJudge: And the remainder? What did she say about the rest?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she wasn’t giving it to me.\n\nJudge: Why?\n\nPlaintiff: She didn’t say why.\n\nJudge: If she said she didn’t owe you anything, why did she give you the $1,000?\n\nPlaintiff: I don’t know, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: What did she say when she gave you the $1,000?\n\nPlaintiff: She told me I wasn’t getting any more money from her.\n\nJudge: Okay. Defendant, tell me what happened.\n\nDefendant (Barbara): My uncle came home in June, and he had a lawsuit settlement for $9,779.\n\nJudge: That amount was put in your account?\n\nDefendant: Correct. $5,000 of it went to his lawyer years ago.\n\nJudge: So that means there was an additional $4,779 in your account.\n\nDefendant: He never told me it was a loan. He knew he was going away. He told me to make sure I took care of the family, and that’s what I did.\n\nJudge: How does “take care of the family” translate to spending his money?\n\nDefendant: I took care of the family—my son, my mother, and his nephew.\n\nJudge: Did he tell you to give $1,000 to his nephew?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff: No, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: What did you say to her?\n\nPlaintiff: I told her to use it but put it back.\n\nJudge: Do you have proof of what he said?\n\nDefendant: No, it’s just his word against mine.\n\nJudge: When the plaintiff comes to court, he has the burden of proof. But in this case, there’s no dispute that the money was his. You’re the one who must prove it was a gift.\n\nDefendant: I gave him $1,000 because he had no money, no place to sleep.\n\nJudge: Why would you do that if it was a gift?\n\nDefendant: I was just helping.\n\nJudge: My verdict is for the plaintiff in the amount of $3,779.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "persuasion, evasion, gaslighting, emotional appeal"}
{"id": "988", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff Shaita Barnes. She says she was going to rent an apartment from the defendant, and as it turns out, the thing was a fire trap.\nJudge: Shaita Barnes, you are suing your former landlord, Felix Figueroa, for $1,880 in security deposits, rent that you paid, and moving services because you found out that the place was an illegal sublet. Tell me what’s going on.\nPlaintiff: Just to start, I signed the lease with Felix and my witness, Loreno Richards, on October 23rd of 2012. That was a Wednesday. He allowed me to start moving things in earlier, but due to Hurricane Sandy, I didn’t physically spend the night in the apartment until Friday, November 2nd. Four days after being in the apartment, my girlfriend, Loreno, was coming over. I went to open the door for her, and when I did—\nJudge: Does she live there with you? Is she your roommate?\nPlaintiff: No, she’s my girlfriend.\nJudge: Okay. So, she’s not on the lease?\nPlaintiff: No, absolutely not.\nJudge: Do you have the lease with you?\nPlaintiff: I do.\nJudge: Okay. So, she comes over. What happens?\nPlaintiff: The type of lock that Felix had on the door, it’s the same key that you use to get in that you use to get out. You have to lock the door from the inside. So, I'm on the phone with her, trying to open the door, and I’m thinking, \"I must be bugging,\" because I had only been in the apartment for four days. I’m thinking, \"I must have the wrong key.\" Felix left the keys on the window sill for me when I moved in. She says, \"Throw the keys down.\"\nJudge: Is that the first time you had needed to open and close the door?\nPlaintiff: No, it had worked before. But that night, it wouldn’t open. It was really dark outside. I had a flashlight, threw the keys down to her, she came up through the back—because there was only one entrance, no front entrance—and she wasn’t able to open the door.\nJudge: What kind of place were you renting? A basement?\nPlaintiff: It was a third-floor attic.\nJudge: An attic. Did you have your own entrance and exit?\nPlaintiff: The same way you got into the apartment was the only entrance and exit.\nJudge: Okay. So, now what do you do? Does he live there too?\nPlaintiff: He does. Felix lives on the first floor.\nJudge: So, you go downstairs, knock on his door, and tell him what?\nPlaintiff: I tell him she can’t get out of the apartment. So, she’s locked in her own apartment.\nJudge: Got it. So, what happens next?\nPlaintiff: He comes upstairs, tries to jig the door, and he can’t get it open. He goes downstairs, gets a hammer, and tries to open it. Then he goes back down and gets something else, like a flathead screwdriver.\nJudge: At this point, how long had you been living there?\nPlaintiff: Four days.\nJudge: And then one of you starts taking video?\nPlaintiff: I took a video just to see how long it would take. We tried for at least 30 minutes before he managed to open it with the screwdriver.\nJudge: Was there a fire escape?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: You came up, tried to open the door. What was wrong with it?\nDefendant: The cylinder lock wasn’t working properly. After we opened it, I noticed someone must have tampered with it.\nJudge: How can someone tamper with a lock they’re using as intended?\nDefendant: The deadbolt and the regular lock use the same key. Somehow, the mechanism wouldn’t retract.\nJudge: So, you forced it open with a screwdriver?\nDefendant: Yes.\nJudge: That’s not how doors are supposed to work.\nPlaintiff: That’s what got me thinking. I have asthma. I also remembered a news story about a fire where firefighters couldn’t rescue people from a third floor because there was only one exit. So, I called Bridgeport Zoning. They told me the house had always been listed as a two-family house.\nJudge: Do you have a Certificate of Occupancy for the attic?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: Then you rented out an illegal apartment. That means you cannot collect rent. You cannot keep security deposits for damages you did not claim. You cannot charge a pet deposit. You owe her back the security deposit, pet deposit, and any additional money for the last month's rent. That totals $1,200.\nPlaintiff: I also paid moving fees in and out of the apartment.\nJudge: You would have paid for moving out of your last apartment anyway. I will award you the moving-out cost, bringing the total to $1,540.

Next case on the docket: The plaintiff says Sunny was on a leash when the defendant's dog viciously attacked, but the defendant says the plaintiff's dog was the aggressor. It's the case of Sunny Side Up. Thank you, Douglas. Sueellen Kemp, you are suing Amy Heckler for $515 in vet bills when, according to you, her dog, unleashed, attacked your dog.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Tell me what's going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your honor. Um, it was March 8th, a nice evening, about 9:30 at night, and I was taking my dog for our little evening walk. We were taking a short walk that night. So we were just walking down our street, which was about two blocks. We took a turn in front of Amy's house, and at that time—\n\nJudge: Did you two know each other before this?\n\nPlaintiff: No, ma'am.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I have lived on Sunset Beach now for five years, and I did not know her. Did not know her at that time. So anyway, I was out walking my dog, and we turned the corner to do our short walk. Sunny was on my right side, and as we were going down that street, all of a sudden, this dog comes out from nowhere and all of a sudden he's attacking my dog. I look up and I say, \"Is that your dog?\" She says, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Oh, you know, please help me! Help me!\" At that point, my dog was down on the ground. All I could see was a square head of a dog, and then I just didn't know what to do. I couldn't pull my dog off. Amy—now I know her name—couldn't pull her dog off. And all of a sudden, I guess Amy fell down. All I could do was start to scream for help because there were people watching what was going on.\n\nJudge: Why couldn't you guys pull the dogs off?\n\nPlaintiff: Because my dog was down on the ground being attacked.\n\nJudge: No, but I'm saying that you physically couldn't—listen to my question. She physically couldn't handle the weight of her dog and physically wasn't strong enough to pull him off? Or nobody wanted to pull him off because he had your dog by the—I'm not following what you're saying.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, your honor. She was trying to pull him off but physically couldn't handle it.\n\nJudge: All right, then you caught the attention of a couple of teenagers?\n\nPlaintiff: Exactly, teenage boys, yes.\n\nJudge: What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: They came around. They could hear me screaming. They could hear the dog fight. So they came around, and they saw what was going on. They took the leash out of my hand—I still had Sunny's leash in my hand—and then they broke the fight up.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then we all dispersed and went our own ways. Did you think that there were no injuries to your dog at the time?\n\nPlaintiff: At that point, he was able to walk away. I didn't see any blood.\n\nJudge: So you thought it was going to be okay.\n\nPlaintiff: I thought it was going to be okay.\n\nJudge: As it turned out, it wasn’t, though, right?\n\nPlaintiff: That is correct.\n\nJudge: How many days passed before you realized that your dog was injured?\n\nPlaintiff: This was Thursday evening. Then on Saturday morning, I had my friend Bob, who lives on the corner from me, come by and check on my dog during the day. He was shaking his head, shaking his head, and just out of balance. Bob called me at work and said, \"Sunny needs to go see the vet.\" So I said okay. This was on a Saturday, so my veterinarian was closed, and they said I should go to the emergency clinic, which I did as soon as I got off work that night.\n\nJudge: And then, as it turned out, Sunny needed stitches in his ear.\n\nPlaintiff: That's correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, now, Amy, tell me your side of this.\n\nDefendant: At first, I didn’t even know who she was. It was a week later that I heard from her.\n\nJudge: But you remember a week ago when there was a dog fight?\n\nDefendant: I knew what happened, but—\n\nJudge: What was your dog doing?\n\nDefendant: My dog wasn’t really loose. We have a porch, and I was sitting there. He was on the porch with me.\n\nJudge: Loose? Unleashed?\n\nDefendant: Yes, but he was with me.\n\nJudge: That means he wasn’t under control, though.\n\nDefendant: He’s never come off the porch before.\n\nJudge: But he did this time, right? That’s the problem. The law requires you to have full control of your dog at all times.\n\nDefendant: I grabbed his harness immediately, but the other dog was right there.\n\nJudge: Florida is a strict liability state for dog attacks. That means you are responsible for the actions of your dog, period. You pay the vet bill. $515, judgment for the plaintiff.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "defendant", "manipulation_techniques": "minimization "}
{"id": "153", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties, please raise your right hand. Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiffs say the defendant ripped them off in a real estate deal, but the defendant says no way—the plaintiff found another house and he's entitled to the money she paid him. It’s the case of Your Real Estate Is Unreal.\n\nJudge: Lorraine Peters and Vashy White, you are suing Sugrim Jagay for $3,487. $2,500 of it is a deposit that you claim he won’t return. The rest includes lawyer’s fees, interest, and prepaid phone cards for calling Guyana. You want him to pay for those now that the deal has fallen through. Tell me what’s going on.\n\nPlaintiff: Mr. Jagay was selling a property back in Guyana.\n\nJudge: Are both sides from Guyana?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, and we decided to purchase the property.\n\nJudge: I’m a little bit confused—who owns the property, you or the government?\n\nDefendant: I own the property, but it was leased to us from the government.\n\nJudge: Wait a minute. How do you own the property if it’s leased to you by the government?\n\nDefendant: I own the house, but the land belongs to the government.\n\nJudge: Okay. So what were you selling her, the house?\n\nDefendant: The house and the land.\n\nJudge: But how do you sell the land if you don’t own it?\n\nDefendant: We can transfer it. That’s part of the contract.\n\nJudge: So apparently, you two understand the process—I’m the only one who doesn’t. When the lease is up, they have to enter into another lease with the government?\n\nDefendant: Yes, eventually, they give us a lease, and then we get title to it.\n\nJudge: So at the end of the lease term, whoever owns the physical building owns the land as well?\n\nDefendant: Right.\n\nJudge: In the meantime, do you make payments to the government on the lease?\n\nDefendant: No, we pay to the local authority.\n\nJudge: But you do pay something?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So you were going to buy a house in Guyana that he was selling. How much was it?\n\nPlaintiff: $60,000.\n\nJudge: U.S. dollars?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do you have a contract?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, we entered into an agreement.\n\nJudge: This contract was entered into in 2006?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, ma’am.\n\nJudge: The contract specifies that possession of the property will be delivered on or before August 1st. The vendor—that’s you, Mr. Jagay—shall transfer title to the purchasers within three months of the date of the determination of the application for approval of transfer of title.\n\nJudge: Where does it state how long it will take for the government of Guyana to approve the transfer?\n\nPlaintiff: The problem is that it didn’t happen in the time allotted.\n\nJudge: You entered into a contract to buy a piece of property in Guyana for $60,000 on April 29th. Why do you want your money back?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t hear from Mr. Jagay until I wrote him a letter in August of 2006. I made several phone calls, but no response. Then I sent a registered letter, and that’s when I heard from him.\n\nJudge: You had his phone number?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: What happened when you called him?\n\nPlaintiff: It went to voicemail, and he didn’t call me back.\n\nJudge: And you left messages?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So what did the letter say?\n\nPlaintiff: That we made an agreement for the purchase, and I wasn’t hearing anything from him. My ex-husband didn’t hear anything from his power of attorney in Guyana. It had been over three months.\n\nJudge: As I understand it, the sale was approved in late August 2006. Two weeks after your letter, he sent you a photocopy.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but my relatives in Guyana were never informed.\n\nJudge: Mr. Jagay, after the property was approved, how did you notify her?\n\nDefendant: My niece informed her husband, and he told her.\n\nJudge: When was this?\n\nDefendant: Early September, about three or four days after the approval.\n\nJudge: And what did she say?\n\nDefendant: She told me they were no longer interested in buying the property. They had purchased another house.\n\nJudge: Is that true?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nDefendant: I had already spent nearly $2,000 in property valuation and processing fees. I agreed to refund half of their advance, but they refused.\n\nJudge: That may not have been a good idea. Where in the contract does it state that if the deal is not completed in three months, she gets her money back?\n\nPlaintiff: It was a verbal agreement.\n\nJudge: That’s a problem. You can’t verbally change a written agreement.\n\nPlaintiff: The Ministry of Agriculture told me there was no paperwork.\n\nJudge: But I see paperwork. He has proof. You’re saying you never received it?\n\nPlaintiff: No, we never got any paperwork.\n\nDefendant: I gave it to her husband.\n\nJudge: There was a meeting with lawyers in September where this was discussed?\n\nDefendant: Yes, in their presence. They demanded their money back. They had already bought another property.\n\nJudge: Make sure she gets a copy.

{"id": "15", "dialogue": "Judge: This is the plaintiff, Terrence Rush. He says he's in the vending machine business, and the defendant has three of his machines and refuses to return them. The defendant has no right to keep the machines. He knows the judge will side with him today and is suing him for their value, which is $4,000.\n\nThis is the defendant, Gregory Brent. He says he and the plaintiff were supposed to split the income from their machines, and when the plaintiff came to collect the money from him, he didn’t give him his portion. His store is located across the street from a school. He generates a lot of money and wants his split.\n\nHe’s accused of playing games, but the defendant has filed a countersuit for $600, the loss of income he was owed.\n\nAll parties, your radiance. Welcome back to The People’s Court.\n\nNext case on the docket: The plaintiff rented out vending machines. The defendant got three of them and won’t return them. But the defendant says they were supposed to split the income from the machines, and the plaintiff stiffed him.\n\nIt’s the case of \"Sure Plays a Mean Gumball.\"\n\nThank you, DC.\n\nAll right, TNT Vending, represented by Mr. Rush, is suing K&J Wireless and GM Food Mart, represented by Mr. Brent, for $4,000, the value of some machines that you say you had a contract with him for to leave in there, that belonged to you, and you don’t see them anymore.\n\nAnd you have a counterclaim for loss of income from those same machines.\n\nOkay, first, let’s discuss what the agreement was between you two.\n\nJudge: You have a series of vending machines. What kind of machines are they that are in his place?\n\nPlaintiff: There is a tabletop arcade video game.\n\nJudge: And which game?\n\nPlaintiff: Pac-Man.\n\nJudge: Pac-Man? Did that make a comeback? And what else?\n\nPlaintiff: There is also a sucker machine.\n\nJudge: A what?\n\nPlaintiff: It’s called a sucker—like a lollipop. It’s a sucker machine.\n\nJudge: How does that machine work?\n\nPlaintiff: You put a quarter in the machine, and the sucker rotates around and falls down.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay. So, a lollipop machine. Not a lot of challenge in that one. And what else?\n\nPlaintiff: And there was also a gumball machine.\n\nJudge: Okay, I know how those work. So those are the three machines. And then you entered into a contract with him. Is the contract in writing?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it is.\n\nJudge: May I see it?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How long has the contract been in effect?\n\nPlaintiff: Two years.\n\nJudge: All right, and the contract says that he lets you put your machines there and the two of you split the proceeds from the machines, right?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Okay, so on the gumball and the lollipop machine, he gets 30%, and you get 70%.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: And on the game machine, he gets 50%, and you get 50%.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: It worked well until when? When did things start going poorly?\n\nPlaintiff: Things started going down as of December of 2017.\n\nJudge: Oh, right away. So, it didn’t work very well at all. In December, what happens?\n\nPlaintiff: The profits started going down.\n\nJudge: Going down from what? It had only been around for two months.\n\nPlaintiff: I do have receipts showing when I give him a copy of it, that I get a copy of what comes out of the machine.\n\nJudge: How does it work? You physically go there, and then the quarters are counted in front of both parties?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Would you go in weekly?\n\nPlaintiff: I go in, um, usually once a month.\n\nJudge: So at the end of October, you got a reading, then the end of November, it was less, and the end of December, it was even less?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct.\n\nJudge: Why is that a problem with him? He has every incentive, just like you, to want more quarters.\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, Your Honor, but the business was not open every day at certain hours.\n\nJudge: Where does your contract say how long he has to be open?\n\nPlaintiff: It doesn’t state how long.\n\nJudge: You don’t control when he opens and closes.\n\nPlaintiff: I understand that, Your Honor, but what I’m saying is that it was not open to the public.\n\nJudge: I understand exactly what you’re saying. If you want him to be open 40 hours a week, you need to put that in your contract. Otherwise, he opens and closes whenever the heck he wants. It’s his business.\n\nBut in any event, you notice that the profits are down. How much are they down? How much were you getting a month at first?\n\nPlaintiff: As I stated here—\n\nJudge: Let me see that.\n\nPlaintiff: Here you go.\n\nJudge: Thank you. So, the first time you checked at the end of October, the total amount from the video game was $62, so you gave him $31. The total amount at the end of November for the tabletop video game was $47, so you gave him $23. Then, the total amount in December was $33, and you gave him $16. The gumball machine made $6.\n\nOkay, they’re not doing that well. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I stopped by to see if someone was there—no answer. No one was at the business. It had a board in front of it.\n\nJudge: Did you ever say, \"I want to take my machines out because you’re not open enough\"?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, I did.\n\nJudge: When did you say that?\n\nPlaintiff: Some time went by, in August.\n\nJudge: Are you telling me that for eight months, you weren’t able to get in there?\n\nPlaintiff: That’s correct, because it was always closed.\n\nJudge: Have you been closed for eight months?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Have you been closed at all for any reason?\n\nDefendant: Sometimes in the morning, I don’t open because the school’s not out. The traffic for everything is the high schoolers. So after 2 o’clock, that’s when we’re mainly open.\n\nJudge: Have you received any money from these machines since December of 2017?\n\nDefendant: No, because I was in and out of the hospital.\nJudge: What were you in the hospital for?\n\nDefendant: I had a medical condition, so I was in and out for about four or five months.\n\nJudge: Were you operating the store at all during that time?\n\nDefendant: No, I wasn’t. My son was helping to run it part-time.\n\nJudge: When was the last time the plaintiff was able to access the machines?\n\nPlaintiff: August 2018.\n\nJudge: And what happened when you tried to get them?\n\nPlaintiff: The business was locked. No one was answering my calls. I had no way to retrieve my machines.\n\nJudge: So, at what point did you officially request to remove them?\n\nPlaintiff: Around that time, I told him I wanted my machines back, but I wasn’t able to get them.\n\nJudge: Did you ever refuse to return them?\n\nDefendant: No, I didn’t refuse. He never formally requested them back in writing.\n\nJudge: Do you still have the machines?\n\nDefendant: No.\n\nJudge: Where are they?\n\nDefendant: I had to move locations, and when I moved, the machines were taken by the property owner.\n\nJudge: Why would the property owner take machines that don’t belong to you?\n\nDefendant: Because I owed rent, and when I couldn’t pay, the landlord took possession of things left in the store.\n\nJudge: Did you tell the landlord the machines didn’t belong to you?\n\nDefendant: No, because I wasn’t there when they were taken.\n\nJudge: So, you lost his machines as part of an eviction process?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you notify the plaintiff that his machines were in jeopardy?\n\nDefendant: I wasn’t thinking about that at the time, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: That’s a problem. These machines didn’t belong to you, and you allowed them to be taken. So, you are responsible for their loss.\n\nDefendant: I understand, but he also wasn’t paying me my share of the profits fairly.\n\nJudge: That’s your counterclaim, right? That you were owed money from the profits?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I believe I was owed at least $600 over time.\n\nJudge: Based on the records, the income from these machines was declining steadily. There was never a time where you were owed anything close to $600 in missing payments. Your counterclaim is denied.\n\nJudge: As for the plaintiff’s claim, these machines were lost due to the defendant’s negligence. You are responsible for their replacement value.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $4,000.

You lent him $300 one time. He said he’d give it back to you in two or three days, which he did.

You have a counterclaim against her for $3,500, the value of your car that has also apparently become a total loss based on an accident that the two of you had. Miss Bonner, why don’t you tell me first? Come on up to the chart, if you will, and let me know if that helps you to explain what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: Okay, so this is me, and this is Mrs. Ramos. She was driving down Fifth Avenue, and a car came out and tail-clipped her car, which sent it airborne.\n\nJudge: Airborne? So, you had to hit her pretty hard, and it went on top of your car?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Get out of here! I don’t know if it’s going to stay, but give it a shot. Wow, that’s good. I’ve got some seriously good staff. Hold on one second.\n\nJudge: Back it up. She’s going down this way. This car hits the back of her. Did you see the actual accident?\n\nPlaintiff: All I saw were headlights coming toward me.\n\nJudge: Was it dark?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, it was 10:30 at night.\n\nJudge: So go on.\n\nPlaintiff: I saw the headlights coming in my direction, and then my boyfriend, who was driving, braced for impact. There was no stopping—it was happening.\n\nJudge: And the headlights were high up in the air, not where a car should be?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Was there a lot of screaming?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really. I was too scared to scream.\n\nJudge: So, this car hit her with such impact that she goes flying in the air?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And does it land in front of you and then on you, or just literally on you?\n\nPlaintiff: I’m not sure. All I know is that when I got out, I saw the van on top.\n\nJudge: I think we get the idea. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: All I know is that when I got out, I saw the van on top of my car.\n\nJudge: What did you do?\n\nPlaintiff: My boyfriend was driving. I was in the passenger seat.\n\nJudge: Come on up, boyfriend.\n\nPlaintiff: I couldn’t get out of my door, and my boyfriend opened his door to get out. So, I climbed over the seat. I looked up and saw the van. I was just in shock.\n\nJudge: Did you know it was on top of you? Did the roof cave in?\n\nPlaintiff: No, the roof didn’t cave in.\n\nJudge: What did you do? Did you save yourself, or help her get out?\n\nBoyfriend: I got out and helped her out.\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nPlaintiff: When we got out, the car caught on fire.\n\nJudge: What about the lady in the car on top of yours?\n\nPlaintiff: She was already out when we got out.\n\nJudge: And then both cars caught on fire?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: How long after you exited the car did it go up in flames?\n\nPlaintiff: About five minutes.\n\nJudge: Oh my gosh. Not even?\n\nPlaintiff: Not even.\n\nJudge: How long have you two been together?\n\nBoyfriend: Four years.\n\nJudge: What are you waiting for? You go through a near-death experience with a woman like that, and you’re waiting for something better? This is a sign!\n\nDefendant: I was going north on Fifth Avenue.\n\nJudge: Come on up here.\n\nDefendant: I was here. I was trying to avoid him from hitting me because I saw him coming out, and he clipped me.\n\nJudge: How hard did he clip you?\n\nDefendant: I honestly don’t know, but my car went airborne.\n\nJudge: So, her car hit your car and went under it?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, your car didn’t go flying up?\n\nDefendant: Well, either way, I mean, I was propelled.\n\nJudge: What was going through your mind when you realized you were flying through the air?\n\nDefendant: I was thinking about my kids. I just wanted to make it out.\n\nJudge: How many seconds did that moment last?\n\nDefendant: It felt like an eternity.\n\nJudge: And when you landed and realized you were alive?\n\nDefendant: I just wanted to get out.\n\nJudge: Did you have your seatbelt on?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Did you have your seatbelt on?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: God bless you all. Go on.\n\nDefendant: I jumped out of the car.\n\nJudge: Did you have to jump a car-high distance?\n\nDefendant: Yes, it was quite high up.\n\nJudge: Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I have pictures of my injuries, but not the car.\n\nJudge: Can I see pictures of the cars?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Lordy! Oh my gosh. That’s the two cars?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Totally on top of one another?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Now, does anyone have a police report?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: When you filed your complaint, you mentioned a third car.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, the car that hit her fled the scene.\n\nJudge: Did you see that car?\n\nPlaintiff: Not really.\n\nJudge: Was there a witness?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And that witness corroborates that another car hit her first?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: So why are you suing her if what happened wasn’t her fault?\n\nPlaintiff: I understand accidents happen, but that’s why you have insurance. If she had insurance, I would have had coverage for my car.\n\nJudge: But your insurance had lapsed because you didn’t pay it on time?\n\nJudge: If you’re driving and someone hits you, sending your car flying onto another car, are you responsible for damages?", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal ,playing the victim,deflection"}
{"id": "476", "dialogue": "**Judge:** This is the plaintiff, Raymond Event. He says he bought a truck from the defendant, and when he went to start it up and drive it off her property, it wouldn't start. He pushed it out of the backyard, got a mechanic to look at it, and he said the thing needs a new engine and there's no way the owner didn't know that before she sold it. The defendant refuses to return his money, so he's suing her here today for the $1,000 he's owed.\n\nThis is the defendant, Debra Rebecca Dixon. She says she had an old truck in her backyard, and the plaintiff asked if she was selling it. She said sure and told him then and there that sometimes it cuts off when she was driving it. He said he could fix it, bought it, and now wants to return it. She's accused of sticking a guy with a bad truck.\n\nAll parties, please raise your right hands.\n\n**Judge:** Welcome back to The People's Court. Next case on the docket: The plaintiff bought a truck from the defendant, and it was in such bad shape that he had to push it off her property. But the defendant says it was an old truck, and he took his chances. It's the case of \"Truck You.\"\n\nThank you, Douglas. Raymond Havent, you are suing Debra Rebecca Dixon for $850 that you paid for a truck. Plus, you want the money you paid the mechanic to look at the truck back, so a total of $1,000, because according to you, she violated the Lemon Law. Okay, tell me what happened.\n\n**Plaintiff:** Okay, I met this lady here back in—uh, doing volunteer work. So I delivered a refrigerator to her house. That's how I met her. She had a nice truck in the yard. I can show you pictures of it.\n\n**Judge:** She had what?\n\n**Plaintiff:** A nice truck.\n\n**Judge:** A nice truck in the yard. Can I see the pictures?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Yes. I love these trucks too. They're good trucks.\n\n**Judge:** Uh-huh. What year was the truck?\n\n**Plaintiff:** 2001.\n\n**Judge:** 2001, and it was what?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Ford Expedition.\n\n**Judge:** Expedition. I used to have one of those. Okay, go on.\n\n**Plaintiff:** So, uh, I asked her what was wrong with it. She said it kept cutting off, and she got tired of putting gas in it because it kept cutting off.\n\n**Judge:** When you asked her what was wrong with it, she said it kept cutting off, and she was tired of putting gas in it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, that pesky little detail. Cars where you have to keep putting gas in them, right?\n\n**Plaintiff:** But see, I thought just cutting off had to be something simple, like the gas or—\n\n**Judge:** Why would it be something simple? It could be something horrible.\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, but—\n\n**Judge:** And why are you going to trust her? Does she look like a car mechanic to you?\n\n**Plaintiff:** No, but she said it was just cutting off. That’s what I went by. But she should have told me the engine was locked up in it.\n\n**Judge:** How's she going to know that?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She knew. Anytime you drive a vehicle and sell it, you know what’s wrong.\n\n**Judge:** Was she driving that vehicle?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Well, she drove it to her house in a part of New York.\n\n**Judge:** When was the last time she had driven the vehicle?\n\n**Plaintiff:** Oh—\n\n**Judge:** When was the last time she had driven the vehicle?\n\n**Plaintiff:** She never told me she really did.\n\n**Judge:** Okay. Now let me hear your version of this, which is exceedingly different.\n\n**Defendant:** Approximately right after Christmas of 2017, my refrigerator started malfunctioning. So, my sister and I, we lived together, and we needed a new one. Mr. Raymond was the driver of the delivery truck that brought us the refrigerator—him and his coworker.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** And he saw the vehicle in the yard and asked me if it was for sale. It had been sitting there for four years. I said, \"Sure.\" He asked me how much, and I had read the Blue Book and everything before. It was like $700 to $1,000. Since I didn’t know what was wrong with it, I said the highest price.\n\n**Judge:** Okay.\n\n**Defendant:** And, um, Mr. Raymond, he came over two or three times a month. He called too many times a month after the fact.\n\n**Judge:** Why?\n\n**Defendant:** To explain to me why he didn’t have the money, that he would have the money, that he was in an accident.\n\n**Judge:** Did he want you to sell it to someone else?\n\n**Defendant:** No, right. But he never had the money.\n\n**Judge:** How much later did he come up with the money?\n\n**Defendant:** October.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, so we’re talking about ten months of him calling you, saying, \"Is it still there? Is it still there?\"\n\n**Defendant:** Right.\n\n**Judge:** Then what happens?\n\n**Defendant:** He kept coming and visiting and just coming to look at the vehicle. My brother would tell me, \"He’s out there again.\"\n\n**Judge:** Did he ever ask for the keys to try to start it up?\n\n**Defendant:** I told him I did not want him to work on the vehicle in the yard.\n\n**Judge:** That’s not working on the vehicle. You never asked for the keys to start it up?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I gave him the keys to open the vehicle and look.\n\n**Judge:** Okay, why didn’t you just try to start it?\n\n**Plaintiff:** The reason why it wouldn’t start was because the battery was dead.\n\n**Judge:** Oh, so you did try to start it up, but it wouldn’t start. So you figured, \"Oh, no problem, I’ll buy the car anyway.\" Rather than having a mechanic look at it before you paid for the car, you decided, \"I want the car.\" You negotiated a price of $850, and you handed her $850, and she handed you a bill of sale that says: \"I, Debra Dixon, grant sale of the Ford Expedition 2001.\" It has a VIN number and it says, \"As is.\"\n\nWhat did you think \"as is\" meant?\n\n**Plaintiff:** \"As is,\" but I didn’t think—\n\n**Judge:** Does it mean you get to come to court and sue her and say, \"You didn’t tell me this thing was a piece of garbage\"?\n\n**Plaintiff:** I thought I was going to have a good set of wheels for $850.\n\n**Judge:** It’s an \"as is\" sale. It’s buyer beware. You should have had a mechanic take a look at it beforehand. That’s my verdict. Good luck, folks.\n\n**(End of case)**\n", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "emotional appeal, deflection, persuasion"}
{"id": "503", "dialogue": "Judge:\nThis is the plaintiff, Wallace Tillman. He says he met the defendant on a bus ride to a casino, and she asked him if she could borrow $200 to get her car out of the impound. He loaned her the money, and then she disappeared, thinking he wouldn’t be able to track her down. Well, you need to get up pretty early in the morning to outrun him. He’s here suing the defendant for $525, which includes the loan plus interest.\n\nThis is the defendant, Sandra. She says the plaintiff’s a married flirt who loaned her $200. When she was ready to pay him back, he told her he didn’t want the money; what he wanted was to rent a hotel room and have sex with her. She refused. He disrespected her, and that’s the only reason he’s suing.\n\nJudge:\nAll parties please raise your right hands. You may be seated. Thank you. Mr. Tillman, what’s going on?\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nWell, your honor, I met this young lady on a bus ride to the Sands in Pennsylvania, which is a casino. After that, once we came back home, I heard from her again. She told me her car was pulled over and that she had to go to the DMV to renew her driver’s license and registration because they were suspended. She also said her car was impounded and needed $200 to get it out. I felt sorry for her and loaned her the money.\n\nJudge:\nSo you loaned her how much?\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\n$200, and I put it in writing. The $200 was going to become $535 if she didn’t pay me back on time.\n\nJudge:\nWhen was the loan made?\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nOn February 5th.\n\nJudge:\nAnd when was it supposed to be paid back?\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nBy February 8th.\n\nJudge:\nSo she was supposed to pay you back, and she didn’t?\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nNo, I didn’t have the money that day. I texted him and told him I couldn’t give him the money before work, but I would have it later.\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nShe didn’t have the money on February 5th, and she didn’t have it when we saw each other on the bus. She lied and said she would give it to me after the bus ride, but when I went to meet her, she still didn’t have it.\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nI didn’t have the cash at the time, but I told him I would get it later. I tried to pay him, but when I gave him the money, he said he wanted to go to a hotel room and have sex instead of getting the $200.\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nThat’s not true. I never asked her for that. I asked for my $200. She kept avoiding me.\n\nJudge:\nWhat happened when you met at the casino?\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nWhen we met, I gave him the $200. But he told me that he and the bus driver had rented two rooms upstairs and said he wanted to go upstairs and have sex with me instead of taking the money. I refused, and I walked off.\n\nJudge:\nDid you feel disrespected?\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nYes, I did. He propositioned me, and I didn’t appreciate it.\n\nJudge:\nSo, what happened after that?\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nAfter I didn’t get the money, I went looking for her with the bus driver. We finally found her at the casino. I asked for my money again, and she got upset. She didn’t want to pay me. That’s when I said I was adding extra fees.\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nThat’s not true. He never told me he was adding extra fees. He just kept insisting I should give him the money.\n\nJudge:\nLet’s take a look at the texts. It appears there was quite a bit of communication. (Judge looks at text messages on the phone.) The messages show a series of texts from you, Mr. Tillman, asking for the money. You texted her multiple times, asking for your money, and then you said this needed to happen today. But there’s no mention of you being upset about the sexual proposition. Why didn’t you mention that in these texts?\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nI was upset, but I couldn’t bring it up in the texts. My phone was broken, and I couldn’t retrieve all the texts.\n\nJudge:\nBut you didn’t mention anything about him propositioning you in these texts, even though that’s your defense. You should have texted him, saying how dare you proposition me, but you didn’t. Instead, your texts just ask about paying back the money.\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nI didn’t feel it was the right time to mention it. But I’m not a prostitute, and I didn’t want to give him anything after that.\n\nJudge:\nI’m not feeling much sympathy for you right now. You lied about the money, and you lied about the sexual proposition. I believe you owe him $525, which includes the $200 loan and the extra fees you agreed to.\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nThank you, your honor. I’m glad this is over.\n\nJudge:\n$525 for the plaintiff, plus court costs. This is what happens when a $200 problem becomes a bigger issue.\n\nDefendant (Sandra):\nI’m a little embarrassed. I know what I said happened, and I’m upset about the judgment.\n\nPlaintiff (Wallace Tillman):\nI was shocked when I heard her story. I never did anything like that. But I’m glad I got my money.\n\nJudge:\nCongratulations on winning the case, Mr. Tillman.

{"id": "351", "dialogue": "Judge: Gusto Uko, you are suing Amanda for $760 that you claim she has not returned to you. This was a payment you made to hold an apartment. According to you, she changed the rules. Amanda, you say that he changed the rules. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff: On January 24th, I contacted Amanda via a Craigslist ad that I answered. I'm a little nervous.\n\nJudge: Yes, Craigslist keeps us in business. Go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff: So, we arranged a meeting. I came with my friend Trisha, and we went to view the apartment. Once I entered the apartment, I was met by Miss Amanda. She showed me around, and we spoke a little bit. I was very in love with the apartment. It had hardwood floors, a nice bathroom. The bathroom was nice. I love bathrooms with tiles, and it was very large. I was moving in with my dog, and so I mentioned that I had an animal. We spoke about that briefly.\n\nDefendant: Originally, my ad said no pets except for a goldfish. But when I saw his email was from CCNY, which is my school, I wanted to make an exception for him. His girlfriend I recognized from some classes, so I felt like I wanted to help a fellow student.\n\nJudge: What kind of animal was it?\n\nPlaintiff: A pit bull.\n\nJudge: Trained as a guard dog?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And you were okay with that?\n\nDefendant: I was okay with it. You take the good with the bad.\n\nJudge: So, you want to take the apartment. Did you sign anything?\n\nPlaintiff: No, the lease was supposed to be signed when I moved in. She gave me a receipt.\n\nDefendant: The lease was going to be signed on the day he moved in. He read the lease off my computer. He even corrected his name because I had misspelled it.\n\nJudge: Why didn’t you print out a copy?\n\nPlaintiff: She said she didn’t have any paper or ink. I had never seen a printed copy of the lease.\n\nDefendant: That’s not true. He never asked for a printed copy that day.\n\nJudge: So, you never saw a printed copy, but you were still happy to move in. What went wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: She started acting a little shifty. I kept asking for the lease, and she made an excuse that her computer broke. I have text messages to prove that.\n\nJudge: Let me see those texts.\n\nPlaintiff: Here you go.\n\nJudge: \"My laptop is at The Genius Bar getting a new LCD screen. Totally did not drop it, no sir. Won’t have it back till Tuesday.\" Why was Tuesday a problem?\n\nPlaintiff: It wasn’t, but she never gave me the lease.\n\nJudge: Okay, but you were still fine until you weren’t. Where are you living now?\n\nPlaintiff: Downstairs from my parents' home.\n\nJudge: Was that place available when you were looking for this apartment?\n\nPlaintiff: No, it became available later.\n\nJudge: So maybe you just changed your mind. Why shouldn’t I see it that way?\n\nPlaintiff: I had concerns about the electricity bill. The lease said I would be responsible if the bill went over $80. I texted her about minimizing costs, and she wasn’t open to discussion.\n\nJudge: Your rent was $750, including utilities, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, but if the electricity exceeded $80, I had to pay extra.\n\nJudge: And you wanted to lower that threshold?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: It sounds like you wanted to renegotiate your rent.\n\nPlaintiff: I just wanted clarity on the terms.\n\nDefendant: He texted me asking to measure the doorway and also asked for my full name and address to send me something. I found that odd. Then, on January 30th, two days before move-in, he texts me saying, \"We are going to look at the bills and divide them accordingly—electricity 70/30, water 50/50.\"\n\nJudge: That wasn’t the agreement, was it?\n\nDefendant: No, my ad and our conversations made it clear: $750, utilities included. Then he says, \"Perhaps we have a different notion of what our arrangements are. I believed we were coming to live together based on a partnership.\"\n\nJudge: You weren’t looking for a partner?\n\nDefendant: No, I was looking for a roommate. I told him that.\n\nJudge: And how did he respond?\n\nDefendant: He said, \"Well, I’m looking for a friend and a partnership, so it seems we’re incompatible.\" Then he asked for his deposit back.\n\nJudge: And you refused?\n\nDefendant: Yes, because I took the room off the market for him. I turned away other potential roommates.\n\nJudge: So, he changed his mind, and now he wants his money back. Is that fair?\n\nPlaintiff: I didn’t change my mind. The terms weren’t clear.\n\nJudge: The terms were clear: $750, utilities included, unless the electricity exceeded $80. That was stated upfront. You can’t renegotiate after committing.

{"id": "992", "dialogue": "Judge: Danielle Sanchez, you are suing Darla and Anthony Vons.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, sir.\n\nJudge: For $5,000. You say you're actually out more than that.\n\nPlaintiff: That is correct.\n\nJudge: For your security deposit, moving fees, and you want them to pay you the rent that you didn't get to pay them when they wrongfully evicted you. That is a first, so I can't wait to hear that. You have a counterclaim against him for $5,000 for slander. Okay, talk to me, Mr. Sanchez. What happened?\n\nPlaintiff: Yeah, first off, I live in Western Massachusetts. For a while, about a good three weeks this school year, I was commuting from point A to point B, which is West Hartford. I attend UConn, I'm a graduate student, and I'm actually studying social work. Next semester, I’m going to take some more classes in law. But in the interim, I decided to move closer because of my vehicle—you know, gas prices are going up. I decided to move to West Hartford. One day I checked in the school cafeteria, and they had a listing of available places. So I decided to call.\n\nJudge: You go there, you see it, you like it. Tell me what it is you were renting.\n\nPlaintiff: I was renting a one-bedroom. The way she operates, she has six or seven different students, ranging from high school kids from China and other students that rent there. But she only accepts cash payments. That’s what she did to me when I first moved in.\n\nJudge: But did she live there?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, she does. And she has six or seven students at the same time.\n\nJudge: So you were renting a room in the same floor that she lives on?\n\nPlaintiff: That is correct.\n\nJudge: All right, so you rent the place out, and what goes wrong?\n\nPlaintiff: After the second week, Anthony, her husband, has this really aggressive attitude. One time he came back late from work, knocked on my door, and told me, \"Daniel, this is not working out.\"\n\nJudge: What do you mean?\n\nPlaintiff: He goes, \"First off, I see that you wear a lot of cologne, and you seem to be a really sharp dresser.\"\n\nJudge: What did you say?\n\nPlaintiff: I told him I try to act professional because I’m a grad student, and I have to present myself professionally. And he just tells me, \"You know, this thing, this is not working out.\"\n\nJudge: Because you wore cologne?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You didn't think that was odd?\n\nPlaintiff: I thought that I just wanted to look professional.\n\nJudge: Complaining that you wore cologne?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Go on.\n\nPlaintiff: He tells me after two weeks, \"I don’t think this is working out.\" He didn’t even give me a chance. I told him, \"I signed a one-year contract. I gave Darla $550 already, in addition to one month’s deposit.\"\n\nJudge: What did he say?\n\nPlaintiff: He said, \"Don’t worry about that, we’ll give you your money back.\" I had to hire some help to move out. Two people at $20 an hour for Saturday and Sunday, which is about $10.\n\nJudge: Any proof of your moving expenses?\n\nPlaintiff: Yes, I do.\n\nJudge: Okay. Mr. Vons, what was it that happened that caused you to ask him to move after only a couple of weeks?\n\nDefendant: When he moved in—first of all, we’ve been having students in our house since 2007. Our house is surrounded by three colleges and universities. So Darla was like, \"It’s a five-bedroom house, we only take up two bedrooms, let’s rent out some of the rooms for students.\" We’ve been doing that for four and a half, five years now. Never had a problem. But at night, he would use the bathroom, and the whole house would start smelling horribly. He did that three times a night.\n\nJudge: Did you ever tell him that?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I told him.\n\nJudge: He says you told him he wore too much cologne.\n\nDefendant: No, that was not cologne you buy in a store.\n\nJudge: Plaintiff says he was evicted because he wore cologne. Defendants say what the plaintiff did in the bathroom was a crime against humanity. Let’s continue.\n\nDefendant: When he moved in, he packed the room up completely. You could barely even open the door. Stuff piled on top of stuff, food everywhere, trash, boxes in the middle of the floor. We have a cleaning lady who comes in once a week, and she told Darla, \"I can't clean that room, I can't get to anything.\"\n\nJudge: Let me see the pictures.\n\nDefendant: Here they are.\n\nJudge: (Reviewing pictures) I see a guy paying you $500 for his room. He gets to put stuff in there. So, I understand why you told him to leave, but why did you keep his security deposit?\n\nDefendant: When he called and asked for his security deposit, I told him, \"Daniel, I can’t get that smell out of your room.\"\n\nJudge: What smell?\n\nDefendant: The smell had permeated the walls.

Like I said, I didn’t even go inside the house.\n\nJudge:\nThen how do you explain the damage? Who would have done this if not you?\n\nDefendant (Rosaly):\nI don’t know! He had people coming and going all the time. His friends were always hanging around, and he told me things would go missing from time to time.\n\nJudge:\nPlaintiff, you said your roommate let her in.

{"id": "985", "dialogue": "Judge:\nDaniel Benal, you are suing Homero Zapata for $5,000, the amount you paid for a vehicle that you claim you never got a valid title for. Tell me what happened.\n\nPlaintiff:\nYour Honor, around June 18th, a mutual friend named Anthony facilitated an exchange. I traded a watch I paid $7,000 for in exchange for the defendant’s car, which he was selling for $5,000.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nPlaintiff:\nAt the time, I was living in Massachusetts. It’s impossible to live there without a car—I couldn't get a job, etc.\n\nJudge:\nWhat made you move to Massachusetts if you didn’t already have a job?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI did have a job lined up, but I couldn’t take it without a car.\n\nJudge:\nWho proposed this trade?\n\nPlaintiff:\nIt was my idea.\n\nJudge:\nWhat kind of watch was it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nA Chopard Grand Prix Del Monaco. Limited edition. There are 500 in the world.\n\nJudge:\nWhy didn’t you just sell the watch, keep two grand, and buy the car?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe resale value fluctuates depending on whether you have the box and papers. A barter was easier.\n\nJudge:\nOkay, so the car gets delivered to you how?\n\nPlaintiff:\nJuly 2nd. The defendant drove it up to Massachusetts.\n\nJudge:\nWho did you give the car to?\n\nDefendant:\nI drove it up and gave it to him directly. I already had the watch before that.\n\nJudge:\nSo he just gave you the watch before even getting the car?\n\nDefendant:\nYes. He trusted Anthony, and Anthony trusted me.\n\nJudge:\nThen what happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI went to register the car at the DMV that week. They told me the title was defective. I have a copy here. The car was registered to someone named Timothy, not the defendant.\n\nJudge:\nWho is Timothy?\n\nDefendant:\nI bought the car at an auction. I planned to buy it for a relative.\n\nJudge:\nDid you ever register the car in your name?\n\nDefendant:\nNo, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nSo Timothy signed over the title?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, but there were cross-outs, and I was misinformed. I thought I could sign it over directly. I didn’t know.\n\nJudge:\nSo, plaintiff, you went to the DMV, and they wouldn’t accept it?\n\nPlaintiff:\nCorrect. Over the next few weeks, I tried to sort it out with the defendant.\n\nJudge:\nDefendant, when did the plaintiff first notify you?\n\nDefendant:\nAugust 7th.\n\nJudge:\nWhy the delay, plaintiff?\n\nPlaintiff:\nI had been going back and forth with the DMV.\n\nJudge:\nI don’t buy that. I think you waited a month. So, what did you do next, defendant?\n\nDefendant:\nHe mailed me the title. I received it on August 13th. The next day, I went to the DMV to fix it. They told me it would take six to eight weeks. I told the plaintiff, and he was okay with it.\n\nJudge:\nDid the new title come?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, on October 11th.\n\nJudge:\nWhen did you inform the plaintiff?\n\nDefendant:\nOctober 12th. I texted him. He never responded.\n\nJudge:\nPlaintiff, when did you file this lawsuit?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBefore I heard from him.\n\nJudge:\nWhere is the car now?\n\nPlaintiff:\nStill in Massachusetts, parked in Anthony’s backyard.\n\nJudge:\nSo here’s how this works. When you sell a car, you’re supposed to provide a good title. The plaintiff went to the DMV and couldn't register the car. The defendant then cooperated fully and did everything he was supposed to do. He fixed the title issue as soon as he got the paperwork from the plaintiff.\n\nJudge:\nThe delay between August 14th and October 12th was due to the DMV. That’s not the defendant’s fault. You agreed to wait for the new title. By the time he got it, you had changed your mind. But you can’t just undo the deal because of a DMV delay you knew would happen.\n\nJudge:\nThis is your car, plaintiff. Do you have the title, defendant?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nHand it over. Did you sign it in the right place this time?\n\nDefendant:\nNot yet.\n\nJudge:\nGood.

On November 27th, my fiancé and I were on our way to put a deposit down on our wedding venue, and en route, we were at the intersection of Division Street and West Street.\n\nJudge: Go ahead and walk over here and tell me how it happened. Make yourself one of those cars. Pick a car, any car.\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): So we were right here. I had a green light. There was a car right here.\n\nJudge: And that's the railroad track?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): It's the railroad tracks. Daniel's behind. Daniel's behind. So I had a green light, I was about to go around the corner, and I noticed that Daniel put on his reverse lights. So I stopped. He was about 20 feet in front of me. He began to back up. When he was 10 feet in front—\n\nJudge: Wait, is there a train passing?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): There's a train, yes. The gates are down.\n\nJudge: And is the train taking a long time, as trains do?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): That railroad crossing is notorious for long trains. He was backing up. When he was 10 feet in front of me, I put my hand on the horn. He kept backing up, and that's when he hit into me.\n\nJudge: Wow.\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Yeah.\n\nJudge: So you hadn't turned?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): I was rounding the corner, stopped, so I was midway through the turn.\n\nJudge: Were you in motion, or you weren't in motion?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): I stopped when I saw him put his reverse lights on.\n\nJudge: But he was plenty in front of you at that point?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Yeah.\n\nJudge: What do you think he was doing?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): I think he maybe didn't want to wait for the train and was going to maybe make a U-turn.\n\nJudge: Where did he damage your car?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Right here, the right front.\n\nJudge: Put the cars where they were when the impact happened.\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Okay.\n\nJudge: And you saw him coming? You had time to— It's not like you were turning the corner and he was backing up?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Correct. I saw him and—\n\nJudge: Okay. Go ahead and go back. Let me hear from you, Daniel. How did the accident happen?\n\nDefendant (Daniel): I was sitting there waiting for the train. The gate was down. Next thing I know, I got hit in the rear end. That's it.\n\nJudge: How is it that they don't see a long train or hear a long train when they're turning the corner? Are you suggesting they turned the corner and didn't know you were stopped in front of them?\n\nDefendant (Daniel): When she hit me, the train wasn't coming. The train was over. I think either in the station or it went through already.\n\nJudge: What happened when you got out of the car?\n\nDefendant (Daniel): Nothing. I looked at the damage, and he started yelling at me, \"What the hell are you doing backing up?!\" He started swearing at me, saying he wanted to beat the baloney out of me.\n\nJudge: Okay. One says you rear-ended me. The other says you backed up and hit me. Who wins in a case like that?\n\nAudience Member: Nobody wins.\n\nJudge: That's one way of looking at it.\n\nAudience Member: If somebody's too close, it could be their fault. If somebody's backing up and not checking, it could be their fault. But who wins?\n\nJudge: Inside the courtroom.

It only has one car described. There should be two cars described because there are two cars in the impact. You've given me the insurance, but there's something missing because there should be a drawing of the vehicles, and I'm not seeing it. Do you have pictures?\n\nPlaintiff (Jennifer): Yes.\n\nJudge: Let’s see the pictures.\n\nJudge: Okay, so now the damage to their car is not in the front end. It's on the right side of the car, the passenger side. So how can it have happened the way you're saying it happened?\n\nDefendant (Daniel): What do you mean?\n\nJudge: If you are suggesting they rear-ended you, wouldn't I see the damage in the front?\n\nDefendant (Daniel): She came around the corner, and she hit me in the rear.\n\nJudge: If she's hitting you in the rear, the damage should be at the front of her car.

It was bought here to the states.\nJudge: Okay. Do you have a picture of it?\nPlaintiff: I no.\nJudge: Okay. Okay what happened was?\nPlaintiff: I normally always go upon it. I've been dealing with these people for five years. They're very good at what they do. I never had a problem with them. I was surprised cuz in the past when I've left the chain and I've been away cuz I travel a lot they've set me letters to the home and telling me listen your P two you got to pick up your poor or it could be sold.\nJudge: Uh don't you know when it could be sold?\nPlaintiff: Yeah they give it like 30 days before they sell it would.\nJudge: Okay hold on one second. Would they... Can I see the paperwork from the pawn?\nPlaintiff: Sure there's like a ticket.\nJudge: Okay let me see both.\nDefendant: This is our original copy.\nJudge: Right and according to what you agree to, what are the terms you're... you're borrowing how much?\nPlaintiff: Uh $450.\nJudge: And and they for months does he have to pay interest payments on those months?\nDefendant: Uh yes he does. The loan is good for four months. He can either pay the interest uh at the four months or he can extend it but that's something he needs to tell you. I want to extend it.\nJudge: No all he has to do is show up uh after uh after and speak right?\nDefendant: He has to tell you I want to extend it after after it's late. We send out late notices. He can come in. He can pay the uh... he can pay the interest and we extend it for him an additional four months.\nJudge: Okay but now all right. So if he turns it in on November 9th and this document says the pledge may be sold four months from the date of the pawn, so it's four months from November 9th. December, January, February, March, so it's March whatever, March 9th.\nDefendant: That's correct. Correct.\nJudge: And then what happens on March 9th?\nDefendant: March 9th actually uh we do give the customers extension. Uh New York State uh requires us to give like a 30-day uh grace period. We actually go above and beyond that and extended uh some of these loans are extended out almost to eight months without a payment sending out the letters and holding it.\nJudge: Uh what did you do in this case?\nDefendant: In this particular case uh we actually sold the item due to nonpayment uh up in July 18th.\nJudge: July, July 18th. Okay item was sold. Did you send him uh... you say that New York law requires you to extend 30... why they just make it a...\nJudge: All right well New York law requires you to extend 30 days.\nDefendant: This is a sample of the late notice that we send out to uh all of our customers. Also have a uh a receipt from the United States Postal Service with his name and address that's on file that we actually mailed this out on uh on the uh...\nJudge: I need the one that from this case. Do you have something from this case?\nDefendant: No I don't have Mr. Galanis because the system uh keeps these items for about six months. I couldn't go back to his exact uh...\nJudge: Why does it only keep him for six months? Uh they... you presume that anyone who's going to sue you is going to be prompt because they can sue you for four years. You should keep it for longer than six months. That's a... that's a a thing particularly in this day and age where everything can be kept in a cloud. It doesn't even actually take up room. I mean I... I... I don't get... get that right.\nDefendant: That's just a sample of the type of late notice we do send out.\nJudge: Yeah watch this. Did you get a late notice?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: Okay that's where having a late notice that you sent to him, keeping a copy of it would come in mighty handy right?\nDefendant: But I do have a stamp receipt from the postal service that we did send the late notices out.\nJudge: That's good. Let's see that.\nJudge: Who authors this?\nDefendant: Uh that is a uh that is a printout from our system and the United States postal Service stamps it uh once they receive all of the uh the mail that goes out on the late notices. They uh check off the actual names and they stamp it that they actually...\nJudge: Check off name by name or they just...?\nDefendant: That's what they do. It takes uh about two and a half weeks to get these copies back because they're uh they're so busy. It's a... it's a timely process but that's what we have to do. It was done on March 21st. That's when the late notice was sent out to Mr. Galanis and it was sent to...\nJudge: That's correct. Is that your address?\nPlaintiff: M and I told him...\nJudge: Was that your address?\nPlaintiff: No.\nJudge: And I told him that. Was that ever your address?\nPlaintiff: Yes in the past.\nJudge: Okay don't say no. I know you had said earlier that that was your address. You said that in your complaint. So that was your address at one point now.\nPlaintiff: Oh the actual loan document where you signed says...\nJudge: Yes that's where you signed. Yes. How are they going to know you moved?\nPlaintiff: I told them that.\nJudge: Well does it look like you told him that cuz that's the address that's here. What address you think they're going to send notice to other than the address that's here?\nPlaintiff: Sure the day that I sign the paper I ask the gentleman that's my... that's not my... that's my old address and he...\nJudge: Well they take the ID, they make a copy of your new ID, your new address.\nPlaintiff: Why didn't you just cross out that address and put the right address?\nPlaintiff: Oh well I felt I didn't want to cross out contract paper. I didn't want to do that.\nJudge: But he told me correct address. You'd rather keep it wrong?\nPlaintiff: No but he told me that they could fix...\nJudge: Watch this. Did that happen? Did you talk to the people who's the person who actually took in the pawn?\nDefendant: Uh one of our pawn brokers at our store.\nJudge: I presume you've spoken to that person?\nDefendant: Yes I have.\nJudge: Okay and does that person say he gave me a new address and I botched it and I didn't put his new address?\nDefendant: No he did not Your Honor.\nJudge: Okay so you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander right? Like what... what's the deal here? When you go give a pawn, you know pledge, when you take one, when you go to pawn...\nPlaintiff: Let me see your license.\nJudge: They take an ID and that they take an ID. But they take an ID. They don't know if you have the old license. Maybe your... maybe your license has an old address. See because they expect you to be giving them the address they need to have on the contract. They don't expect you to give an old address. They might think it's far more likely that your license hasn't an old address that you haven't updated than it is that you're going to stand there and fill out a contract with an old address or let an old address be on a contract. I... the truth is you probably didn't notice that they didn't even sell it until July. What happened between March and July? Why didn't you just show up?\nPlaintiff: I travel. I'm in Florida.\nJudge: What do you do for a living?\nPlaintiff: Uh I host parties, tourist you know like if you get picked up in limo you get taken to...\nJudge: Okay but you know did you contact them?\nPlaintiff: Yes by...\nJudge: Before the day... Can you prove that you contacted them by phone? Do you have a phone record?\nPlaintiff: No but I could get one.\nJudge: I can request one. We're here now. This is the trial. This is where you... you're the guy who sued so you know what the issue is. So is it the plaintiff's fault that this stuff got... the necklace got sold?\nDefendant: Absolutely. If you don't have a proper ID to for them to cont...\nJudge: Well the idea is proper. The thing is that that... that the address was old on the driver's license.\nDefendant: Well then the... I mean it's kind of the plaintiff's fault. If they can't contact you in a... a proper manner then it's kind of tough luck. It seems pretty obvious to me.\nJudge: What do you think?\nDefendant: It's obvious especially if you want your necklace back. Make sure they have the proper...\nJudge: The necklace is that important to you right?\nPlaintiff: Right.\nJudge: Common sense. Got it.\nAnnouncer: Going inside the courtroom.\nJudge: They're saying it's July judge. We haven't heard from him. You according to you, you have no... no contact with him. He doesn't pay an interest payment in March, doesn't pay an interest payment in April, doesn't pay an interest payment in May, doesn't pay an interest payment in June. Correct? You don't pay any and then in July you finally sell it after having sent him notices. Why aren't you just like another guy who just didn't get around to it and so this is the gamble. See here's a problem. The pawn brokers do what they do. If you could get those four... what did you need the 450 for?\nPlaintiff: Uh was going away somewhere else to Atlantic City so I wanted extra cash.\nJudge: Cash to get?\nPlaintiff: Yeah that was my mistake. You know as we say in Cuba. Okay. I called them. I notified them. They told me it's okay.\nJudge: Order up the hot chocolate. Pay what you owe pal. This was a gamble in itself. Come on, come on, come on, you know the rules. Just follow the rules otherwise you're just another guy who lost his...\nPlaintiff: I called him. I notified them.\nJudge: They... prove it. Watch this. Watch this. Did he call you and notify you and ask you for time and try to work something out with you?\nDefendant: No Your Honor.\nJudge: Okay so now how you gonna prove that?\nPlaintiff: How would he know that he wasn't even there?\nJudge: How do you prove it? How do you prove your position? Just another guy coming around too late to pick up the pawn. Oh and by the way, what it says in the back of your ticket, cuz you need to read it, side from reading the address you got to read on the back where it says and by the way if you sue us for anything your limit... the value of your item is double what we loans you. You can never sue us for that's a million dollar item. No, now you can't. Can you hear me?\nPlaintiff: Was talking still.\nJudge: Oh thought maybe you couldn't hear me. Thought maybe I was talking in my head or something. And so the most you could suit for anyway would be double the 450. But here's where we are. You sign a contract. You... right a quarter inch above where you sign has an address that is the address that obviously is on the contract. That's where they're going to send the notice. You don't change it and then you are an experienced... you're not even like a guy who ran into trouble. You're a guy who wanted extra money for Vegas. You are experienced with them. You know the rules. You got to play by the rules. You don't play by the rules. The house wins. The house wins.

Then the agreement was I would have to pay half the rent—we would have to split it down the middle.\n\nJudge:\nSo now it went up to what?\n\nPlaintiff:\n$675, plus half of the lights.\n\nJudge:\nWere you paying that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nAnd then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff:\nAt some point, she got mad at me and decided that I needed to go.\n\nJudge:\nWhen was that?\n\nPlaintiff:\nThe incident happened on September the third or fourth. One of my daughter-in-laws called Crystal and told her she had been to the house to pick up my grandchildren. She was upset about it. She came in, raving at me and arguing.\n\nJudge:\nI don’t understand. This is the daughter-in-law who she had previously told you couldn’t come over?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nSo why was that daughter-in-law calling her to say she had been at the house?\n\nPlaintiff:\nBecause I told my daughter-in-law that I was no longer going to keep the kids. She wanted me to raise them.\n\nJudge:\nThese are children she didn’t even know you were caring for?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, Crystal knew. She gave me the okay that the kids could come to the house.\n\nJudge:\nCrystal, did you give her the okay that the kids could come at all?\n\nDefendant:\nShe turned my house into a daycare.\n\nJudge:\nWhat is your issue with your sister-in-law?\n\nDefendant:\nI don’t have a problem with her. It’s just the drama with my brothers and my siblings—the marriage stuff. I don’t want it in my house.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. So she finds out and then she tells you in the beginning of September that you need to go?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes. She started saying, “You betrayed me, you disrespected me.”\n\nJudge:\nShe tells you to get out?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes, she said, \"Not my house. I don’t want you here.\"\n\nJudge:\nWere the lights in your name?\n\nPlaintiff:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nYour other daughter—how old is she?\n\nPlaintiff:\nShe’s 15.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have a good relationship with her?\n\nDefendant:\nI’m 29, so she’s 15. We don’t have anything in common.\n\nJudge:\nWhen you were putting her out, were you worried about the 15-year-old?\n\nDefendant:\nIt was agreed because of the toxic things happening.\n\nJudge:\nYour mother was sending death threats?\n\nDefendant:\nYes, she was.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have those death threats?\n\nDefendant:\nYes.\n\nJudge:\nLet me see them. Did you make death threats?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, ma’am.\n\nJudge:\nYou are only living because of Liz. Who is Liz?\n\nDefendant:\nHer daughter.\n\nJudge:\nOkay. When did you tell her to leave?\n\nDefendant:\nIn August.\n\nJudge:\nDid she ever pay rent?\n\nDefendant:\nNo.\n\nJudge:\nDo you have any receipts for rent?\n\nPlaintiff:\nNo, ma’am.\n\n(Transcript continues through the lawsuit discussion, lack of evidence, and final ruling.)\n\nFinal Ruling\nJudge:\nI find that the plaintiff has not proven her case. No receipts, no legal right to stay, no proof of payments.\n\nZero dollars awarded to the plaintiff.\n\nZero dollars awarded to the defendant on the counterclaim.\n\nI hope you all find a way to work things out.", "manipulative": "1", "primary_manipulator": "plaintiff", "manipulation_techniques": "framing the narrative, playing the victim, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, emotional appeal"}
{"id": "40", "dialogue": "Judge: Karen Jefferson, you are suing your former landlord, Olay Deaayi, for $2,250—$1,920 of it being your security deposit, and according to you, $330 in interest on the security deposit. We'll talk about that in a second. What happened here?\n\nPlaintiff: Prior to Olay, the previous owner rented the apartment through a management company.\n\nJudge: And how long did you live there?\n\nPlaintiff: One year.\n\nJudge: One year. And what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I was offered a job position in Florida, so I got the job offer. I notified the plaintiff that—I mean, the defendant—that—\n\nJudge: So she bought it during your one-year tenancy, right?\n\nPlaintiff: Right.\n\nJudge: So you said, \"I'd like my security deposit back.\" And her answer was?\n\nPlaintiff: When she went through closing, she said that she asked about it. Prior to that, I had talked to her realtor, and he called me asking if I had a security deposit. I said yes, and he asked me how much. I told him $1,950, and he said, \"Okay, I'll get that during the closing.\"\n\nJudge: So then when you talked to her personally?\n\nPlaintiff: When I talked to her physically on the phone, she said she had asked about the deposit, and nothing was said. She said she had to take out a personal—I guess—ass suing the old landlord for the money.\n\nDefendant: I bought the house around August. At the closing table, I asked for the security deposit, if there was any security deposit.\n\nJudge: Did you ask that?\n\nDefendant: Oh, I asked at the closing table.\n\nJudge: You asked at the closing table?\n\nDefendant: Yes, when the checks were already prepared.\n\nJudge: Wait a second. What about a security deposit? Did you have a lawyer?\n\nDefendant: Yes, I did.\n\nJudge: Why didn't your lawyer ask that?\n\nDefendant: He was there. I asked if there was any security deposit, and he said yes. Then I asked for the check.\n\nJudge: Okay. And he said he's going to be giving it to you?\n\nDefendant: Who?\n\nJudge: Who is \"he\"? The lawyer? Your lawyer? Or their lawyer?\n\nDefendant: My lawyer said he asked for it already. The seller's lawyer said it was going to be given to me the following week.\n\nJudge: Next?\n\nDefendant: I think like five or six days after, the seller of the house disengaged the flowing of the water in the house even before we moved in, even before the keys were given to me.\n\nJudge: So what happened?\n\nDefendant: Because Karen was there, I was like, \"No, we can't do this.\" So I had to go to the water corporation, then I paid.\n\nJudge: So your lawyer—\n\nDefendant: I paid for the water, and there was a back bill that the prior owner hadn't paid.\n\nJudge: Why isn’t your lawyer finding all this stuff out before the closing? Because that's kind of the lawyer's job.\n\n(Cut to a discussion outside the courtroom)\n\nInterviewer: So is the defendant responsible for giving the plaintiff the security deposit back, whether the defendant got it or not?\n\nBystander: No, he's not.\n\nInterviewer: Why?\n\nBystander: Because he wasn't there for the initial contract or anything else like that.\n\nInterviewer: So the defendant bought the house, right?\n\nBystander: Yeah, but, you know, he wasn’t in contract, like he said, with the original owner. So he didn’t get any money or anything.\n\n(Back inside the courtroom)\n\nDefendant: My lawyer promised to give me the check for the security deposit and the water bill—about $600-something dollars—but they have to pay me back.\n\nJudge: They're not paying you back. They're calling it a credit.\n\nDefendant: That’s what they'll— I don’t know.\n\nJudge: Maybe they will. My water company wouldn’t pay me. They're just going to call it a credit. And then you have to fill out all kinds of forms if you want it back. You have to hand them your firstborn.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: You know, I cannot believe how many people are treating you wrong. Unbelievable. But here's the thing—you have all the power at the closing table. And you kind of lose it after that. Now you have to chase people.\n\nI have to tell you, there's only one person here who is not going to chase anybody, and that's her. And I'm going to explain why.\n\nI believe every word you're saying. I believe you never saw the security deposit from the prior landlord. It just doesn’t matter.\n\nWhen you buy a property, you buy it with all its assets and its liabilities. And this is one of its liabilities.\n\nDefendant: I never knew it was going to be like this.\n\nJudge: I know. I believe you with every fiber of my being. I know.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So, you are going to have to file a small claims case against— You have two choices.\n\nOne, you tell your lawyer, \"Hey, how did this happen? I’m going to file a bar complaint against you if you don’t help me.\" So hustle up, get off your chair, and get some— you know—help me to get this money. Because your lawyer is sitting back, filing his or her nails instead of worrying about you. And I don’t like it.\n\nBecause this is part of the job at closing, to make sure that his client gets everything they’re supposed to get.\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. So that’s one. Or two, if you're sick of your lawyer, you can always file a small claims case yourself. But you have to do something to get both these monies back now.\n\nAnd I know you didn’t bank on this, but I'll tell you who really didn’t bank on chasing anybody, and that’s her.\n\nShe did not destroy the place. She’s entitled to her money. I'm going to order you to pay her money.\n\nWhen you leave here, I’m going to have a written order for you, so that you can show it to the next judge and say, \"Look, I had to pay her back the money.\"\n\nBecause you should definitely get your money back from that seller. And your lawyer should definitely help you to get it back.\n\nBecause I can’t believe everybody’s sitting around the closing table going, \"Yep, yep, yep, there’s that security deposit,\" and nobody knows that there's money due to utilities and everything else. This is really bad for you.\n\nPlaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: You’re not entitled to that interest. I don’t know how you calculated the interest.\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it was the traveling back and forth and the—\n\nJudge: Yeah, that's not how it works. You're entitled to the entire security deposit, plus the statutory interest on your security deposit, which is not going to be anywhere near the amount you calculated.\n\nBut you are entitled to those things, plus your court costs, of course. You should be made completely whole, and that’s what’s going to happen here today.\n\nPlaintiff: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Good luck to you.

{"id": "873", "dialogue": "Judge: Thank you, Douglas. George Venzano, you are suing Kyle, who doesn't want his company name or last name mentioned, for $59.25 plus interest because, according to you, they won’t make good on a check. Tell me what happened here. How did you meet each other?\n\nPlaintiff: I had jewelry since I was young. My grandmother had given it to me when I was 14 during my first confirmation. I had that jewelry for many, many years. After she passed a few years ago, I swore I would keep it until then, and I decided it was time. I saw the gentleman's shop here and decided to sell it.\n\nJudge: So you went to his place to sell gold. How much gold did you bring? What did you bring?\n\nPlaintiff: The items we just described and a snake necklace, a bracelet from my grandmother, and a crucifix.\n\nJudge: Okay, and then you were issued a check in the amount of $59.25, correct?\n\nPlaintiff: Correct.\n\nJudge: And then what happened?\n\nPlaintiff: I put the check in my pocket. He told me which bank to go and cash it at.\n\nJudge: Well, you can cash it at any bank you want.\n\nPlaintiff: Right, but it was his bank. So, I didn't need the money at the time, so I let it go.\n\nJudge: You sold your grandmother’s blessed jewelry from your first confirmation, and you didn’t even need the money?\n\nPlaintiff: Well, it was because of her passing.\n\nJudge: So what happened with the check?\n\nPlaintiff: I put it away. Later, I lost it. Then I went back to the store and asked if they could reissue another one. The owner looked at the computer screen and said he’d have to call the bank to check if it had been cashed. I said okay. He told me to call back next week. I did. When I called back, the other owner answered and said, \"We don't reissue checks.\"\n\nJudge: Did he give a reason?\n\nPlaintiff: He said they’d had issues before where people deposit checks with their phones and double dip. But the check hadn't been cashed, so I don't see why they wouldn’t reissue it. I asked for my gold back, and he said it was too late because it had been melted.\n\nJudge: How do you figure you can get away with not paying him for his jewelry? He lost the check—an honest mistake—but how is it that you should not have to pay the $59? You arbitrarily decided you don’t reissue checks?\n\nDefendant: We have a policy in effect.\n\nJudge: Show me the paperwork that says if you lose a check, we don’t reissue it.\n\nDefendant: That paperwork is by the register.\n\nJudge: How did he agree to that policy? Policies are only enforceable if both parties agree to them.\n\nDefendant: If I write you a check for a car and you lose it, do I have to write you a new one?\n\nJudge: Yes, you should. There’s a record that he never cashed it.\n\nDefendant's Son: I think he has to pay.\n\nJudge: What’s your relationship to the defendant?\n\nDefendant's Son: That’s my father.\n\nJudge: So, the policy was visible by the register?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: You mean this pristine little document that looks brand new? That one? That’s your proof?\n\nDefendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: That’s not going to work. No judge would let you get away with this. You arbitrarily decided not to pay him. Did your partner make this decision, or did you?\n\nDefendant: I made it.\n\nJudge: Good. So you’re the one being unreasonable. What do you think is fair and just?\n\nDefendant: Either he gets the full amount, or we deduct a fee for canceling the check.\n\nJudge: Why would I let you deduct anything? You didn’t even bother canceling the check. You forced this into a lawsuit over $59.25. Pay the man.

{"id": "30", "dialogue": "Judge: All parties please raise your right hand. Welcome back to the People's Court. Next case in the docket, the plaintiff says the defendant was a bad landlord even ruined her pool table but the defendant says the plaintiff left the pool table behind so it's her problem. It's the case of \"You Owe Me Some Serious Scratch.\"\nJudge: Joanne Fone, yes you are suing a former landlord David Catry for $3,200, the depreciated value of a pool table plus $1,000 in pain and suffering. You have a counter claim against her for $3,615 in damages that you say the home sustained that you discovered after she left. What's going on?\nPlaintiff: Well on July 22nd we did a walkthrough at the apartment and he said everything was good.\nJudge: How long did you live there?\nPlaintiff: A year.\nJudge: And why were you leaving?\nPlaintiff: It was the end of the lease. And he also was trying to evict me because I owed him a half a month's rent so that's why we were going to court the following day, the 23rd.\nJudge: And the outcome was?\nPlaintiff: That he would subtract that half a month's rent from the security deposit and return the rest of the security deposit.\nJudge: So we have already- how much was the security deposit?\nPlaintiff: $725 security deposit.\nJudge: Did you end up returning the half of the security and do you have that settlement from court?\nPlaintiff: I don't have it with me.\nJudge: Do you have the settlement from Court?\nDefendant: No they did- nobody brings it to court. I have a statement from-\nJudge: That's all right keep going.\nPlaintiff: So then I had asked him on the 22nd during the walkthrough if I could leave the pool table in the garage. He said yes there was no problem with that whatsoever on the 23rd-\nJudge: Why did you need to leave the pool table behind?\nPlaintiff: It's slate and I would have needed at least three guys to move that pool table. It's very very heavy.\nJudge: And on the 22nd, the day you asked him if you could store your pool table for how long?\nPlaintiff: He- we didn't give a definite period of time.\nJudge: Why wasn't that included in the settlement?\nPlaintiff: Well usually they can't throw your stuff away before 30 days usually so I was going to definitely do it before then. Because I work for a company that we help people when they have problems with their landlords and stuff like that.\nJudge: Go on.\nPlaintiff: So on the 23rd at the court I asked him again \"Are you sure I can leave the pool table?\" He said yes. He said it was very nice meeting you, he said if there's anything else I can do for you let me know and that's the last time I saw him. And then 6 days later she was babysitting for the gentleman upstairs who's-\nJudge: She?\nPlaintiff: Oh I'm sorry, my daughter.\nJudge: Okay go ahead.\nPlaintiff: So she was going over to the house and there was these kids in the neighborhood were chasing her with pool sticks.\nJudge: What do you mean chasing you with pool sticks?\nPlaintiff: They were just kids joking around like running around with pool sticks like they weren't actually chasing.\nJudge: And what happened?\nPlaintiff: I was like \"Where did you get these pool sticks?\" and they were like \"Oh we got them from your curb\" and I was like \"What?\" and then I go back to where I babysit my old upstairs neighbor and he said that he saw him the day before putting the pool table to the curb.\nDefendant: The pool table, well if you want to call it a pool table which was left at the property was pieces and parts and Joan said just throw everything out. I don't want anything else that's there, get rid of it. I have pictures. So I did the next day, I have to move tenants in.\nJudge: So she didn't ask you if she could store it, she asked if you could get rid of it?\nDefendant: Yeah she-\nJudge: Why she suing now then?\nDefendant: Well she supposedly thinks that the pool table is worth something and there's parts and pieces of the pool table that I do have pictures of where it was seated in the garage if you can find it.\nJudge: Was it in parts and pieces?\nPlaintiff: It was disassembled. That was just where I stored it.\nJudge: So what did she leave behind? She leave other stuff behind too or no?\nDefendant: There was just a lot of debris. You'll see that depicted in the pictures.\nJudge: Why wouldn't you have her sign something that says that you're agreeing for her to leave you behind, she's agreeing for you to get rid of her stuff?\nDefendant: There was no agreement at that time, she just left. We had-\nJudge: Do you have a text, a phone message, an email, something to prove what you're saying versus what she's saying?\nDefendant: No.\nPlaintiff: May I say something? On the 30th, the day that my daughter saw the pool sticks, I called David and I said \"David what happened to my pool table?\" and he said \"I don't know\" and I said \"You don't know what happened to my pool table?\" He said \"Joanne I haven't been there in a couple of days.\" That was a Monday. I called the guy upstairs, he says yes he was here yesterday.\nJudge: And you have an affidavit from the guy upstairs?\nPlaintiff: I absolutely do.\nJudge: Let me see. Who is this person?\nPlaintiff: He was my upstairs-\nJudge: What's his name?\nPlaintiff: Seth Grow.\nJudge: Okay that's your other tenant?\nDefendant: Yes ma'am.\nJudge: And that you have no problems with him?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: He says that he witnessed the walkthrough and when they were finished David said to them they were all set, that everything was good. Joan asked David if it was all right to leave the pool table in the garage until she found people to move it and he said yes that it would be fine. The following Sunday I witnessed him and another man putting the entire pool table and accessories to the curb after they had moved. David told me that Alexa was not allowed to babysit for my children any longer. I am the upstairs tenant.\nJudge: What were the problems with her that you didn't want to babysitting there anymore?\nDefendant: Well I didn't want any of their friends coming over.\nJudge: Why?\nDefendant: Because they're just disruptive, they're destructive, they're just- they leave things all over the yard. I also do have pictures of the basement of the-\nJudge: What are those pictures going to show me?\nDefendant: Unfortunately the behavior is not- the pictures will render them.\nJudge: But what are these showing?\nDefendant: Well with the bed that's in the basement and all the cans and so on so forth around obviously they're having parties down there and that's okay I mean you can have your parties and have your fun but you can't be disruptive to the other tenant that was upstairs at the time.\nJudge: So you tell them that you don't want her babysitting for his children?\nDefendant: Oh no no I- you can't- I have no right to say that.\nJudge: All right tell me about your counter claim amounts. Let's go through each of the things you're suing for. You're suing to fix the garage door - how did they break the garage door?\nDefendant: They ran into with their vehicle.\nJudge: Is that accurate?\nPlaintiff: When I- when I- when we were going to court before I took pictures of the garage and then I brought a witness because I pulled my car up to show that my car did not- before he changed the garage door.\nJudge: What happened about the garage door at the hearing?\nPlaintiff: It didn't even come up.\nJudge: Didn't even come up?\nPlaintiff: No it didn't. Well he mentioned it and I said I had a witness with me that would state that- well I pulled my car up to the garage door and there's no way that the- that my car could have made a dent.\nJudge: And that you made a- you did a reenactment kind of thing?\nPlaintiff: Well she was there as a w-\nJudge: But is that what you mean?\nPlaintiff: Yes, yes.\nJudge: Replace five trees at $10 each because what?\nDefendant: The trees were damaged by dog urine.\nJudge: Dog urine?\nDefendant: Mhm.\nJudge: How do you know?\nDefendant: Because I asked the person who sold me the trees.\nJudge: How long does a landlord have to keep somebody's property safe before they're allowed to just get rid of it? What do you think sir?\nDefendant: I feel like it would be as long as the lease is act- the lease is over they move out the lease is over.\nJudge: How long do they have to keep-\nDefendant: As long as they want so at that point I think it's fair game to get rid-\nJudge: So the landlord can get rid of it immediately?\nDefendant: I think so.\nJudge: You buying that?\nDefendant: Yeah immediately pretty much yeah.\nJudge: Oh I'll give him a day. Oh you'd give him a day you're so generous such a nice person.\nJudge: Going inside the courtroom how do you know that they're damaged by dog urine? How does one know that? There's rain afterwards like how does anybody know?\nDefendant: The experts-\nJudge: Not me I don't- what are they experts? They're you know- come on.\nJudge: Amount spent on materials to clean oil left on driveway - how come none of this came up at the court hearing? Did you ever bring up the damage refrigerator at the court hearing?\nDefendant: No I did not.\nJudge: Do you ever bring up the reseeding the lawn at the court hearing?\nDefendant: No.\nJudge: Okay these are all things that you saw beforehand so why should I believe that these things are damaged now or that you believe they're her fault that they're damaged?\nDefendant: It wasn't brought up the court it was just for late rent.\nJudge: Okay why is your upstairs neighbor saying that you told her that she could leave it there and then all of a sudden you're throwing her stuff out why is that?\nDefendant: Because they're in cahoots with each other your honor.\nJudge: But that's why I asked you if there was a problem and you said no.\nDefendant: He's going to turn around and he's going to agree with her because you know they're smoking pot out in the backyard together so they're just going to agree with everything.\nJudge: Then the bottom line is just very simple. I mean the guy is actually you know he's doing something that's pretty much against his interest which is pitting himself against his landlord. Has he given you notice, is he leaving or something?\nDefendant: No he's just late every month on the rent so on so forth.\nJudge: So you give him a real hard time about it but that's- he pays it late. What really happened? Did you get a tenant who said I want this totally clean and then-\nDefendant: No there's just parts and pieces in there.\nJudge: I know there's parts and pieces but they don't belong to you. According to my lease you move it out property left will be tossed except for that the law says 30 days afterwards a period of time in order to determine if it's abandoned and typically judges use the period of time of 30 days. And the thing is disassembled it's not even taking up space so I just don't understand- how old was the pool table?\nPlaintiff: I- I- I'm guessing.\nJudge: Do you have a receipt for the pool table?\nPlaintiff: No and that was taped at the bottom of the pool table because who's going to steal a pool table? I didn't think it was- there was going to be-\nJudge: Where'd you get the figure $3,000 for the pool table?\nPlaintiff: Uh 2,200-\nJudge: 2,200 for the pool table?\nPlaintiff: Um where's that paper?\nJudge: I just looked at something similar is that the only example you have for me?\nPlaintiff: I- they're very hard- 9 foot one and a half slate inch pool tables are very very hard to find.\nJudge: I'm going to find in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,500. On the counter claim against her these are all things that you could have brought up during the settlement and according to your own admission did not and you cannot bring them up now.

That --that's --and I just wonder.\r\n\r\nNow Congress, maybe -- maybe it has the power to displace that.\r\n\r\nMay -- may -- maybe, you know, question mark, but maybe, right? But, if the default rule through history has always been intertwined issues go to the jury, and we have -- have a lot of cases, why shouldn't we at least, as a matter of constitutional avoidance perhaps or statutory interpretation perhaps, read this statute to conform with those normal background principles, absent some contrary evidence from you?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nI think it is the nature of -- the unique nature of PLRA exhaustion. And -- and we talk about --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\nWhy is exhaustion different than sovereign immunity or amount in controversy then? Maybe that has to be --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nThere --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\n-- the nature of your argument.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\n--there is a distinction with those jurisdictional cases in general, and one is that jurisdiction generally, those jurisdictional cases, they are closing the courthouse door at least practically speaking to that --that litigant. Also, there is a collateral estoppel effect to the fact-finding on jurisdiction, where that is not true here.\r\n\r\nAnd --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\nIt's -- it's hard to see those in any of our cases, though, resting on any of that.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be resting on the notion that you -- you have a presumptive right to a jury --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nIn none of the jurisdictional --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\n-- in this country.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\n--cases was it an issue that was a prerequisite to suit.\r\n\r\nIf Congress can say what has to be proven in order to --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut it's not a prerequisite to suit.\r\n\r\nWe called it an affirmative defense.\r\n\r\nThe defendant -- the --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\nYeah, sovereign immunity.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\n-- plaintiff doesn't even have to allege it.\r\n\r\nSo it's not a prerequisite to suit.\r\n\r\nIt's an affirmative defense.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't know of any other affirmative defense that we've said isn't subject -- and I think this is --\r\n\r\nDefendant's Lawyer:\r\nSovereign immunity, yeah.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nSovereign immunity is an affirmative defense, and we require to go to a jury.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nThis Court said in Porter versus Nussle that PLRA exhaustion was an affirm -- was a prerequisite to suit, that that is the term --\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nBut, when we got to the issue in Jonas, we said it's an affirmative defense.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nIt's affirmative defense.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't change the fact that it is a prerequisite to suit.\r\n\r\nJudge:\r\nWell, whatever it is, right, you have conceded that it's completely intertwined with the merits in this case, correct?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Lawyer:\r\nOne --one correction. I've --we have conceded that it's intertwined.

So that's the nature of the exhaustion question.\r\n\r\nBut it's as well the nature of the substantive claim that he tore up my grievance papers and in -- in some kind of retaliatory act, right?

{"id": "613", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Kagan?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Elena Kagan.\n\nAnd just on that, if I could get you to focus specifically on Mr. Clement's test and say what you think is wrong with it.\n\nAnd, as I understood Mr. Clement's test, and he will tell me if I'm wrong, but that it's a kind of two-part test. And if it is both remote in time and place, space, and another agency has regulatory authority, then you can't fault the agency for not looking at it.\n\nAnd so, again, Mr. Clement will tell me if I'm making his test more stringent than he would like it to be, but it's two parts.\n\nIf both are satisfied, you can't fault the agency. What's wrong with that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So two things.\n\nLet me start with the other agency's authority piece first. I -- I think Justice Barrett brought out in a -- in a colloquy at the beginning about -- about whether agencies sometimes have concurrent authority.\n\nAnd the answer is yes, they absolutely do in a lot of cases. And -- and therein, I think, lies the problem, that Mr. Clement's rule would say Agency Number 1 passed the -- passed the buck to Agency Number 2.\n\nIt's not clear that Agency Number 2 would then say we're going to do the study rather than pass the buck to someone else. And I think that that's directly in the teeth of NEPA and the -- the provisions for timely and unified federal review, like the one document provision at new Section 107(b), that all the agencies with expertise or jurisdiction, either one, are supposed to be participating in the -- in the NEPA review and to coordinate.\n\nSo that's one piece. The second piece you asked me about is the remote in time and -- and space point. And -- and I think, obviously, our test likewise -- the statutory test would likewise rule out some things that are remote in time or space, but just as foreseeability doesn't have a strict geographic line -- I think Mr. Clement's rule, by making it strictly geographic, that's not really tied to the concept of the project. Projects in our large federal government, you know, especially multi -- multibillion-dollar projects like this one, may well have effects that are felt beyond just next door.\n\nAnd I think that the fact that Mr. Clement says that the only rail line between these -- between this railway and the Texas refinery, so, in other words, every railcar going to Texas or Louisiana, they're all going to come out of this railway, they're all going to turn left, and they're all going to go down the Union Pacific line, Mr. Clement says, well, that's -- that's too remote in time or space for our test to -- to bring it in. We think that the foreseeability test makes that a really good example.\n\nIt is very, very foreseeable that the rail cars that come off of Mr. Clement's 88 miles of track and turn left are going to cross that rail line.\n\nAnd the agency itself foresaw that about once a year there's going to be an accident with an oil-laden car and about one out of every four of those is going to result in an oil spill.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Rebuttal, Mr. Clement?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nJust a few points in rebuttal. First, Justice Kagan, you understand our test perfectly.\n\nAnd the reason it has both elements is to deal with this situation of concurrent jurisdiction or to deal with the situation where another agency has information that bears directly on the project. And that's why, if you look at the mitigation measures that were adopted, both the voluntary ones and the ones imposed, they talk about the other agencies that are involved. And other agencies were directly involved here.\n\nThe most obvious is the -- is the Forest Service that provided a right-of-way. And all of that took place in the cooperation and consultation process.\n\nTwenty-seven agencies were consulted, and nobody's complaining about that.\n\nThat's why it's a disjunctive -- or that's why we have to have both elements there. But, if it's remote in time and space and it's in another agency's -- you don't put them in the consultation process, and you let them deal with the process. The second point I'd like to make is just to be specific about what's wrong with Sabal Trail, in addition to its decision to disregard FERC's judgment that the EIS there was enough. I mean, first of all, it decouples reasonable foreseeability from environmental effects, and that's what the Respondents do as well.\n\nAs long as it's reasonably foreseeable, it's foreseeable that it goes down the tracks 500 miles, never mind that once it gets there, the safety regulation is the job of a different agency; the tracks are no longer operated by my clients; the trucks, the -- the tanker trucks on there are owned by a third party. It's got nothing to do with us.\n\nIf there was an accident there, FRA would come in. They would talk to lots of people and they wouldn't talk to us because we have nothing to do with that down -- that downline accident. So that's one thing that's wrong.\n\nThe other thing that's wrong is it has this formula that if you think about it even a little bit, then it's foreseeable, then you have to study it to death.\n\nThat creates all the wrong incentives. The last point I would make is just about what's before you.\n\nI think the entire environmental impact statement and whether or not you have to consider effects that are not proximate and are in the jurisdiction of another agency is properly before you. The question presented doesn't distinguish between downline and downstream.\n\nI don't even know what that exactly means. There's not a stream here. So I would think you look at all of the things that -- that the D.C. Circuit faulted this agency for and the downline impacts are not materially different.\n\nIndeed, both the refining in the Gulf and the extra traffic on the train tracks in Colorado depends on the idea that there's going to be more upstream development in the basin. This basin is not some small area. It's as big as the State of Maryland.\n\nAnd all of that is speculative.\n\nIf a project happens and there are concerns with the vegetation or whatever, then either the Ute tribe or Utah can make a determination, they can impose their own mitigation measures. Just the last thing I'll say is, if you're worried about sort of trying to provide some additional detail to what's remote in space and time, I do think that the scope of the reasonable alternatives and the scope of the mitigation measures provides a good guide, but this is a common carrier agency. The one thing it could not do is say let's mitigate by saying no waxy oil in these trains.\n\nIt just doesn't make a lot of sense to make that agency responsible for combustion in the Gulf.

{"id": "389", "dialogue": "Judge: I think you're right, Counsel, that there are different rules that apply in different circumstances, that they have different policy concerns or longstanding prudential concerns, and that this Court shouldn't go around disrupting those rules.\n\nThere are lots of different rules that apply with respect to adding diverse parties. Sometimes you can do that.\n\nSometimes you can't. You can add a non-diverse successor in interest, for example.\n\nSo there are lots of different circumstances.\n\nAnd we simply ask the Court to apply settled law.\n\nWe don't think the Court has to come up with a unifying theory for all these different areas of the law.\n\nCongress acted with an important reason here with respect to supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nIt wanted to protect the defendant's right to remove.\n\nAnd I think that's why you see this broad text here.\n\nAnd as well as judicial efficiency.\n\nSo --\n\nJudge: And by \"settled law,\" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill? Or what are you referring to there?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So you're right, Your Honor.\n\nSo St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, and Rockwell.\n\nThere are also cases like Carlsbad, where this Court expressly asked, is a Cohill remand -- that's the phrase the Court used -- is a Cohill remand discretionary? I don't think this Court could answer the question yes without having, again, decided this question.\n\nThere are other cases like International College of Surgeons and Rosado that, again, emphasize that this is a discretionary question. And I don't think this Court should just depart from all of that precedent here.\n\nI don't think there's a good reason to.\n\nAnd this Court should -- this is a statutory question. Stare decisis carries enhanced force in the statutory context, and that's why we've asked the Court to continue to apply settled law.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Justice, do you have any questions?\n\nJudge: Just a couple of quick points.\n\nSo you keep talking about protecting the defendant's prerogative of removal.\n\nBut I thought there was also sort of basic principles about the plaintiff's prerogative to bring a case in state or federal court to be the master of their claims.\n\nAnd so what I don't understand is why the plaintiff has to be stuck with the jurisdictional consequences of claims they are no longer bringing?\n\nThey've given up their ability to seek relief on the federal claims, and so it just seems odd to me, especially when our case law kind of generally links jurisdiction with the claim, you have to have jurisdiction for every claim, those two concepts run together, and yet somehow they can drop claims and still be, in your view, subject to the jurisdictional consequences of that.\n\nThat just seems discordant to me, so can you speak a little bit about that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: It's a really important question, Your Honor, because what Congress was trying to do is take into account the right of plaintiffs to be the master of their complaint but also the right of defendants to remove.\n\nAnd that's exactly what investing discretion --\n\nJudge: But Justice points to statutes that talk about remand.\n\nSo, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there are circumstances in which that right is not given precedence.\n\nThe case goes back to state court, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's exactly right. It's up to the district court to decide.\n\nAnd we think in the mine run of cases where you amend the complaint right after you remove, there's removal to federal court, that's going to go back to state court.\n\nWhat we're really talking about here are more unusual cases where it's been going on for a long time.\n\nThere may be particular concerns --\n\nJudge: Can I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm mindful of the time.\n\nI don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not there is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is.\n\nThat's why the case gets to be removed.\n\nI mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only get to remove it if there's original jurisdiction.\n\nSo isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified original jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were original jurisdiction drop out?\n\nCan supplemental jurisdiction be exercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?\n\nWhen we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument that supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a) says, in any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the district court shall have supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nBut, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone.\n\nSo how can you have supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I think it's really important to go back to the first principles that this Court was applying in Cohill.\n\nIt was looking at St. Paul Mercury, which holds that you have original jurisdiction at a particular time.\n\nAnd so, once you get original jurisdiction, you continue to have supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nThat's what the Court held in Rosado.\n\nThere, the original claim became moot and --\n\nJudge: So wouldn't we expect it to say in which the district court had original -- or ever had original jurisdiction?\n\nIt seems to be in the present tense saying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise supplemental.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And I think that's because you have decades and decades of precedent saying that in a removal context, you look at whether there's jurisdiction at the time of removal.\n\nAt that time, the district court has original jurisdiction, and then the question is, will it continue to have supplemental jurisdiction?\n\nThe text here is framed in a forward-looking future tense, and we think \"shall have\" does cover the situation where there's ongoing supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, Counsel.\n\nJudge: Next, Counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "162", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Kavanaugh, you were asking about correcting the NTAs going forward and how that doesn't address the hundreds of thousands who previously received NTAs without the time and date. Could you finish your answer on that? What will happen to those cases?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Certainly, Justice Kavanaugh. As the Ninth Circuit has interpreted this provision, all of those individuals have a right to seek rescission. And in the Ninth Circuit and some other courts, that right is essentially automatic. We are very concerned that those cases could be reintroduced into the immigration system.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We have already seen some evidence of that following the Ninth Circuit’s panel decision in Singh. In 2021, before the Singh decision, there were 380 motions to rescind in absentia orders nationwide. In 2022, the year of the Singh decision, that number increased to over 6,000. By 2023, it had risen to over 11,000. If this Court sides with the Ninth Circuit, we expect that number to increase dramatically.\n\nJudge: And how do we consider the stop-time rule versus in absentia removal in interpreting the statutory provisions here? Or is that different context not relevant?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it is relevant, Your Honor. One concern the petitioner in Pereira raised, and that the Court considered, was that the stop-time rule gives the government a procedural advantage. The argument was that it is unfair to allow the government to gain that advantage if it never properly initiated removal proceedings.\n\nJudge: What is the procedural advantage? Spell it out.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The advantage is that the non-citizen does not accumulate time toward eligibility for cancellation of removal. This makes removal easier for the government if the stop-time rule is triggered. That perceived unfairness is different from the in absentia removal context.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: In the in absentia removal context, the unfairness would come from allowing non-citizens, who knew they had pending removal proceedings and knew their hearing details, to later claim they lacked notice. This disadvantages others who followed the rules and attended their hearings. A non-citizen like Mendez-Colin, who simply chooses not to appear, could always have their in absentia order rescinded under the Ninth Circuit’s rule.\n\nJudge: So you're better off not showing up?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, absolutely.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Mr. McCloud, can you explain the distinction between the notice to appear and the charging document the government files to initiate removal proceedings?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: For removal proceedings, there is no distinction. The charging document is defined in regulations to include other documents for different types of immigration proceedings.\n\nJudge: And that’s defined only in the regulations, not in the statute?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: The statute’s \"clear and convincing\" standard for in absentia removal proceedings requires the government to prove both that the written notice was provided and that the non-citizen is removable.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: A major concern is the possibility of a blank document or one that omits key details, such as the right to counsel or grounds for removal. Without referring to the regulations, under the statutory language alone, could an immigration judge determine removability if only the notice of hearing was provided?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I don’t believe so. Removability requires an assessment of the charges against the non-citizen. If all the judge had was a notice of hearing with just the time and location of proceedings—\n\nJudge: But the charging document isn’t defined in the statute. It could be different from the NTA, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If the government supplemented the charges, perhaps orally or in an additional document, the immigration judge might be able to evaluate them.\n\nJudge: In the worst-case scenario, where the NTA is essentially blank and only the notice of hearing is provided, could a non-citizen still be ordered removed without ever being informed of the charges against them?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I struggle with that hypothetical because the immigration judge wouldn't be able to determine removability without knowing the charges.\n\nJudge: That’s my point. That’s why I asked about the difference between the NTA and any other document necessary for initiating removal proceedings. If they are distinct, the worst-case scenario could occur despite regulatory safeguards.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Perhaps I was unclear before. For removal proceedings, the charging document is the notice to appear. The notice to appear must include the charges for it to initiate a removal proceeding. If an NTA were blank, there would be no valid charging document, no proceeding, and no way for the judge to assess removability.\n\nJudge: Earlier, you agreed with Justice Gorsuch that proving notice was served is all that’s required under the statute. Are you revising that answer?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I may have misunderstood his question. If we assume away all regulatory protections and requirements for notice to contain charges, then yes, a notice of hearing alone might be deemed sufficient.

Justice Barrett, the context is the question that's asked, the statement that's made, and the objective facts.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: So, if the statement is very specific, if Mr. Thompson had said: I only borrowed $110,000, and not a penny more, and -- and that was essentially the charge, then that would be a false statement.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: So you have to look to the question, the answer, and the objective facts.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nJudge: So it's not just the question.\n\nJudge: It can be surrounding circumstances, as well as the question?\n\nDefendant Lawyer: I would say the objective fact of what -- of what he actually borrowed.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: Right, right, right.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nJudge: I -- I understand that.\n\nJudge: But I'm just saying, you know, when we're trying to figure out what a statement communicates, I guess -- I mean, I guess I agree with Justice Alito about how communication works.\n\nJudge: If we're asking what a statement communicated, and Williams tells us there has to be some sort of statement, there's an assertion -- if you ask what that statement communicated, you have to have some basic understanding of how people use English.\n\nJudge: That's how the jury is going to decide would a reasonable person have found the statement to be false.\n\nJudge: So, I mean, I agree you don't look at any kind of idiosyncratic understanding, maybe, of the person on the other side of the table, but, I mean, you do have to have some kind of understanding of how normal people would understand this in the context of the situation, correct?\n\nDefendant Lawyer: Just -- Justice Barrett, I disagree with that.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: And -- and -- and -- and so did this Court in the Bronston case.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: In the Bronston case, it was absolutely clear what the petitioner -- what the questioner was driving at.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: He wanted to know if the person had had Swiss Bank accounts.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: And the answerer said: Well, my company did.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: And it wasn't pursued.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: And so the situation is very analogous.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: If -- if Bronston's right, then we can't look at what the -- the perception of the listener was.\n\nDefendant Lawyer: We have to look at only the context of the question, the answer, and the objective facts.\n\nJudge: Justice Jackson?\n\nJudge: So I guess I don't understand how, on remand, the Seventh Circuit could make the kinds of determinations that you said that they could make in response to Justice -- to Justice Gorsuch, and the reason is because we had a trial in this case.\n\nJudge: We had a trial in which, presumably, those very same arguments about what, you know, the statement meant to your client, what the bank examiner said, et cetera, et cetera, were evidence that was presented to a jury that was then instructed that they were supposed to make a determination about whether his statement was false, right?\n\nDefendant Lawyer: That's correct, Your Honor.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So what --what is --what is a court to do at the pleading stage when it is presented with highly technical information that is beyond the capability of a judge to evaluate at that stage?

Pretend that the statement was made by a plaintiff, was made by a plaintiff --\n\nJudge\nYeah, I mean, once again, it just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at and weren't expecting to when we took this case, to decide whether this particular report is flawed or not in the way that you suggest.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nJudge, I think our position has been exactly the same in the cert petition, and it's -- you know, I think the reason you have to do it and reverse the Ninth Circuit is what -- what Judge Sanchez said in dissent, which is, otherwise, you've given every plaintiff a how-to roadmap: Hire an expert like this, say it's really complicated, along the lines of Justice Alito's questions --\n\nJudge\nDo you think that the Royal Bank of Canada report is flawed in the same way?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nI have no idea because it's one sentence and doesn't even tell us how it reached anything, as -- as Professor --\n\nJudge\nWell, what do -- what do you -- I mean, presumably, it's out there in the world, right? Presumably, you've read it --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nThe one sentence.\n\nYeah, the one sentence.\n\nJudge\n-- the Royal Bank of Canada report --\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYeah.\n\nJudge\n-- which concluded that NVIDIA understated its crypto-related revenues by more than a billion dollars.\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYes.\n\nSo it's one sentence.

As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation.\n\nSo, when Wisconsin Bell receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it.\n\nFCC mandates also determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund.\n\nThose mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well.\n\nThe point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently.\n\nThe point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government.\n\nThe government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program.\n\nThe administrator merely does what the government wants.\n\nUnder the plain meaning of the word \"provide,\" the government therefore provides the money Wisconsin Bell claims.\n\nThat's true of all the money and especially the hundred million that was discussed more -- earlier.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Mr. Singh, if this had been an appropriated fund and the administrator had been a federal agency, this would be, of course, a very straightforward case.\n\nWe'd know exactly what the government's financial stake was.\n\nBut this is private money from private parties to another private party, and it's very difficult to see what the government's financial stake is.\n\nAnd I think it's -- it -- you might ultimately conclude, or we might, that it is enough to be federal funds.\n\nBut it doesn't look like federal funds.\n\nIt looks like private funds.\n\nSo, in this -- in this instance, would you explain exactly what the government's financial stake is here? It hasn't appropriated any monies, it hasn't given any grants, and it hasn't lost anything.\n\nNo matter what happens here, the government's not out of pocket.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Sure.\n\nSo let me -- let me start with part of the premise I'm not sure I agree with.\n\nAs Ms. Ho admitted in the first part of the argument, this is treated for budget purposes as a permanent indefinite appropriation.\n\nThe appropriation is located in the Telecommunications Act, so it's not a year-to-year appropriation where a specific amount of money is designated, but it is treated for budget purposes as appropriated funds.\n\nAnd so, to the extent that that's significant, I think it's satisfied here.\n\nSuch permanent indefinite appropriations are pretty commonplace throughout the federal budget, and so that piece of the premise I'm not sure I agree with.\n\nBut I take the point that there are aspects in which the funding structure of this program is unusual, that there is less government touching the money than there might be for other federal programs.\n\nAnd, as I said in my introduction, I just don't think that that can be dispositive as to the question whether the federal government is providing the money.\n\nOn the specific question of what has the government lost, I think, if you look at this the way that I do, which is to say the government could have ingested this money into Treasury accounts and then moved it to the administrator and out to beneficiaries -- in fact, we know it could have because it did so in 2018.\n\nIt relocated all of the funds into Treasury accounts.\n\nNothing changed about how the program works.\n\nIt is still the same -- quintessentially the exact same program except for the flows of funds.\n\nAnd so I would say what the government loses is all that money coming in because that is money that the government solely controls to achieve its governmental purposes.\n\nAnd so, when that money is not available because fraud depletes the Universal Service Fund, there is less money on hand to pay the beneficiaries that the government is trying to provide affordable telecommunications services to.\n\nAnd that is really no different, I think, from any other government spending program.\n\nJudge: Well -- I'm sorry, why don't you finish your answer.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No, I think that that's what I've got.\n\nJudge: It is a little bit different, and you mentioned this at the beginning.\n\nIt -- the GAO calls this back -- backdoor appropriations, which is not -- you know, that's a little bit of a pejorative term, I mean, and the reason I think is because you do get a very large amount of money without going through the normal appropriations process.\n\nAnd it seems to me that that's a significant question, maybe at too high a level of generality, but if you can take and spend for whatever purposes you would like any amount of money so long as you require a -- a -- a private entity to pay it into a fund and then you exercise whatever authority you want to dispose of it in a particular way, that seems to me a significant exception to the normal appropriations process, and I wonder if that's a concern at all.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't think it's a concern in this instance.\n\nNobody has made the argument that anytime you have a permanent indefinite appropriation, the False Claims Act just doesn't apply or the program is invalid.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "102", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 23-970, NVIDIA versus Ohman J:or Fonder AB. Mr. Katyal.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Reform Act's pleading standards are unique.\r\n\r\nCongress looked at private securities litigation and saw big fishing expeditions in discovery and extortion at settlements.\r\n\r\nThey knew that for centuries, heightened pleading had been required, but they super-charged it. First, they required plaintiffs to \"state with particularity\" facts giving rise to a strong inference the defendant acted with scienter, a dramatic break with common law, and, second, they required, for allegations outside of a plaintiff's personal knowledge, plaintiffs to \"state with particularity all the facts on which their belief is formed.\" This double-heightened pleading requirement exists in virtually no other context.\r\n\r\nY2K is the lone example, and that is what resolves this case. As our cert petition and the amici explain, the Ninth Circuit's decision creates an easy roadmap for plaintiffs to evade the Reform Act.\r\n\r\nWhen a stock drops, all they have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements, then allege the company keeps records that executives look at, and then argue those records would have matched the hired expert's numbers. That's a recipe for Judge Friendly's warning of fraud by hindsight. This complaint, which alleges that Jensen Huang made false statements, is a good example.\r\n\r\nIt's a grave accusation against a respected CEO.\r\n\r\nYet the complaint never shows his scienter to be as cogent and compelling as not.\r\n\r\nIt merely surmises that Huang reviewed internal reports showing a higher quantum of crypto purchases than what he disclosed, yet it never alleges the contents of those reports. And to meet falsity, the complaint relies on an expert opinion with a series of implausible assumptions and inferences, not particularized allegations of fact.\r\n\r\nNothing dispels the more compelling explanation that Huang offered at the time.\r\n\r\nHe knew crypto buys were increasing prices, and so he introduced a crypto-specific chip and increased the supply of gaming chips with the hopes that prices would fall.\r\n\r\nThe fact this process took longer than anticipated is not securities fraud. The Ninth Circuit slighted the Act's heightened pleading requirements, and this Court should reverse. I welcome the Court's questions.\r\n\r\nJudge: What would this complaint look like if it had complied with the heightened pleading standards?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would have had to allege -- this complaint is based on internal documents, and so it would have to allege the contents of those documents, and particularly, Justice Thomas, for example, it would have to answer what specific data did the CEO actually see, how clear was it, when did he see that data.\r\n\r\nWas the data generated after his public statements or before? How much does that data deviate from the public statements? Where does that data cover? Is it one country? Is it the world? And, you know, when was that data generated? So, you know, what did the CEO know, when did he know it, I think are the most important questions. And, here, when you scratch just below the surface -- and this is what Judge Sanchez's dissent, I think, so powerfully did or the district court did -- by going allegation by allegation, it all dissolves.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly a long complaint.\r\n\r\nI'll give -- I'll spot them that.\r\n\r\nBut it's a long complaint like cotton candy that dissolves after -- it looks like a lot of volume, but it dissolves.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Katyal, I --I guess my concern is that you appear to be requiring for plaintiffs to actually have the evidence in order to plead their case, and I didn't understand the pleading standards, even with particularity, to require that they have the documents, nor do I understand how they could have the documents when discovery hasn't occurred yet.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So -- so, of course, they do have documents.\r\n\r\nIn this very case, Joint Appendix 59 to 62 does provide an internal document.\r\n\r\nIt's a document that entirely backfires on them --\r\n\r\nJudge: No, I understand.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: --as to the --\r\n\r\nJudge: But --but the typical plaintiff --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- in a situation like this --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- because the company has the documents --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Sure.\r\n\r\nSo I just wanted to say factually --\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: -- and, of course, the SEC had access to all the documents and found -- never found scienter, but --\r\n\r\nJudge: Right, but the SEC is not pleading this case.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Of course, of course.\r\n\r\nJudge: We have plaintiffs --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: Absolutely.\r\n\r\nJudge: -- who are bringing these allegations, and you're right that they reference documents, that documents are important to their claim of scienter.\r\n\r\nBut I guess the standard that I hear you wanting us to require would cause them to have to have such level of detail about the contents of the documents that it would seem that they would need to have the documents, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Defendant: So, Justice Jackson, we don't think that's right.\r\n\r\nThat's not our legal standard. Our blue brief at page 40 is express about that.\r\n\r\nOur point is that the document -- that the contents can be met by someone who has the documents or who has personally reviewed those documents and describes them with particularity.\r\n\r\nAnd so we'd say look to, for example, the ABC case from the Fifth Circuit.\r\n\r\nIn that case, it said, look, you don't -- there were -- they didn't have the documents, but they had details about the documents.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

They --\n\nJudge : But they couldn't get it, not under this law, right, because this law is operating around the inconsistency.\n\nSo, if they couldn't get it, it couldn't -- it would be for some other reason, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant : Well, we have other laws in -- in Tennessee law that -- that prevent malpractice and that prevent the use of drugs for a non-medical purpose.\n\nJudge : I understand.\n\nBut this law is the one that is being challenged today, and we're trying to decide whether or not it's operating on a sex-based basis.\n\nAnd we --\n\nLawyer of Defendant : Well, I don't think we --\n\nJudge : -- we have a -- so what about my -- what about my lower voice hypothetical?\n\nLawyer of Defendant : Yeah.\n\nJudge : All right.\n\nSo a biological boy comes in and asks for a hormone treatment to deepen his voice in order to affirm his masculinity because it hasn't come and he'd like to deepen his voice.\n\nCan he get it?\n\nLawyer of Defendant : If there's no medical purpose, no.\n\nJudge : No, that's a medical -- the -- the medical purpose --\n\nLawyer of Defendant : I don't know the --\n\nJudge : I don't understand what you mean.\n\nThe purpose is to bring on a deepening of their voice.\n\nLawyer of Defendant : Let me try to rephrase.\n\nJudge : Yes.\n\nLawyer of Defendant : If there's no medical condition, the answer is no.\n\nJudge : But --\n\nLawyer of Defendant : You cannot use testosterone for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nIt's a Schedule III drug.\n\nYou are not allowed.\n\nJudge : In this statute or in another statute?\n\nLawyer of Defendant : In another statute.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "556", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 23-370, Erlinger versus United States. Counsel, you may proceed.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, robust and clear precedent dictates the outcome here. In case after case, this Court has held that judges applying ACCA may find only what crime with what elements a defendant was previously convicted of—nothing more. The Court has grounded that rule directly in the Sixth Amendment. A judge may not increase a defendant’s sentencing range based on offense-related conduct that the prior jury did not need to find.\n\nACCA’s occasions clause, as this Court construed it in Wooden, requires exactly that kind of factual inquiry. The whole point of the clause, in fact, is to require something more than just three convictions before an ACCA sentence is imposed. As such, the Apprendi rule directly applies to it.\n\nThat leaves amicus’s objection that the Court should eschew that straightforward analysis because applying the Sixth Amendment here would somehow harm defendants. But, as the briefs filed by criminal defense organizations show in this case, that concern is unfounded.\n\nGuilty pleas, waivers, and stipulations make the occasions clause not really an issue that is litigated in most cases. However, in the rare instances where a defendant disputes both the occasions issue and the underlying Section 922(g) charge, bifurcation is a time-honored solution that courts have already shown they can apply to resolve the issue while avoiding prejudice to the defendant.\n\nThis Court should endorse that practice and reverse the court of appeals. I’m happy to take the Court’s questions.\n\nJudge: Counsel, wouldn’t it be more straightforward to overrule Almendarez-Torres?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is certainly one option the Court could consider if necessary, but—\n\nJudge: Do you think we should?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I believe the Court should at some point, but I don’t believe it’s necessary in this case. Our position is that what the Court has already stated in Mathis and Descamps makes it clear that the occasions clause falls outside of Almendarez-Torres. Our briefing did not focus on overruling that precedent because the Court typically does not consider overturning a case unless it is essential to the decision at hand.\n\nJudge: But don’t you and the government essentially agree on where to draw the line?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I believe we agree on many aspects, Your Honor. We agree that the test is whether the fact at issue is part of the prior conviction. The government describes this as whether the fact is \"integral\" to the conviction, while we use the term \"inherent.\" We may have some differences on the margins regarding how that test applies, but this case does not present those issues.\n\nJudge: Almendarez-Torres is an established precedent of this Court that has been relied upon and reaffirmed in subsequent cases. If we were to reexamine it, would it then be appropriate to reconsider the entire Apprendi question? Or are you asking us to only revisit the portion that benefits your argument?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I am not asking the Court to do that today, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: But you seem to have taken the suggestion.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: (Laughter.) I suppose if the Court did revisit that question, it would be fair to go back to first principles. As the Court’s opinions in Apprendi demonstrated, those first principles support the right to a jury trial on all facts necessary to impose a sentence.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "726", "dialogue": "Judge: But you don't -- you're not satisfied with just the Courtright declaration. That isn't going to do anything for you. I still don't -- I don't understand, like, he would be entitled to an advisory opinion about -- you're worried, and I understand it, that he might do this, that, or the other thing that he thinks is innocent and that might put him over the top and get him back on the list. But you want a -- a -- you know, you want to have him -- he needs to have a number he can call up? I'm thinking of going to this particular mosque. If I do that, is that going to put me on the list? I just don't understand how you think this is going to work.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. I think that the only way to determine that would be to know the -- the reasons why he was listed and -- and to make sure that the government is not in a position to invoke those same unlawful reasons again.\n\nJudge: But what if they're --\n\nJudge: What --\n\nJudge: -- not unlawful reasons? So the reason -- one of the reasons was that he was seen socializing with Mr. X, and Mr. X has terrorist associations. So now he wants -- he wants to associate with Mr. Y or Mr. Z.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: It gets -- Your Honor, it gets very fact-specific. But, again, at a -- at a higher level of generality, can the government use his lawful, peaceful associations with others as a basis for his listing? That could be -- the government could take a position that it's not allowed to use the lawful, peaceful associations, and that would solve his association with Mr. X, as well as a future association with Mr. Y in terms --\n\nJudge: Well, you're -- you're --\n\nJudge: This whole thing's based on associations, though.\n\nJudge: You're begging the question when you say they're lawful, peaceful associations. Let's say all they know is that he's associating with a particular person and that's a suspicious person and they don't know why he's associating with the person.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yeah. And the question would be --\n\nJudge: And you want -- you want -- you want them to be unable to rely on that?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Your Honor, I think that gets into the merits now, and the merits would for procedural due process require a balancing, a balancing of the government's interests, a balancing of the alternatives available to the government in pursuing the interests, as well as the risk of erroneous deprivation. The stronger the reason that the government has for the deprivation, the -- the lower the risk of erroneous deprivation is going to be. And so, if the government has a -- a -- an overwhelming reason to put him on the No Fly List like as the hypotheticals suggest, that's going to -- that's going to be enough to get the government where it wants to go with this case.\n\nJudge: And from our standpoint, just in terms of how we're supposed to be looking at this, at least as I thought, aren't we isolating the merits by essentially assuming for the purpose of the determination of either standing or mootness that you're right on the merits, that the government has engaged in unlawful conduct here with respect to how they put your client on the list or whatever? And the question is separately whether or not this is moot or whether or not -- so it's not -- I didn't understand that we were to be concerned about whether you're right on the merits of your argument. For the purpose of this, we say you are, and then we evaluate mootness and standing in light of that?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: I think that's right, Your Honor. And our vernacular is the challenged conduct to -- to communicate Your Honor's point that at the voluntary cessation stage, we're -- we're just trying to see if the government has done something so that the challenged conduct is -- is not likely to recur. And the recurrent -- the -- the merits questions are -- are reserved for --\n\nJudge: Well, I do understand that. The reason why I was going into those questions was because I wanted to know what, if anything, the government could put in a declaration that would satisfy you. That's the reason why I went into it.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: Do you think that's wrong?\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Well, I -- I -- I think that there are things that the government could put in its declaration. They could put a description of the notice, the opportunity to be heard in the declaration. They could disclose the reasons and make a promise that matches those reasons.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "832", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Defendant\nYeah, I would like to correct it.\n\nSo I would urge the Court to go back and look at JA 1 through 3, the very first pages of the JA.\n\nThis is Governor Perry's letter.\n\nI don't read that letter as saying, oh, yeah, this is a great idea.\n\nHe is saying: The federal government has failed its obligations and has not done what Congress said.\n\nYou're not going to have an answer for this for decades.\n\nAnd now Texas is in the spot of, what are we supposed to do? They're going to build it across the border in New Mexico.\n\nTexas needs to have some sort of ability to have some say in this. That is how I would urge the Court. Read pages 1 through 3 of the JA.\n\nThat is not a ringing endorsement by Governor Perry.\n\nHe was just going to say this is the best of the bad options.\n\nGovernor Abbott comes in before this license and he says: No, essentially, over my dead body are you going to do this, citing the terrorist concerns that we are identifying.\n\nAlso, look at the brief from -- the congressional brief, which does this as well.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nJustice Barrett? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel. Plaintiff’s Lawyer.\n\nPlaintiff’s Lawyer\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nJust a few quick points.\n\nFirst, Lawyer of Defendant referred to 42 U.S.C. 2239(a), which refers -- deals with the Commission adjudications.\n\nBut that provision doesn't say, if a person satisfies certain requirements, that person becomes a party or is a party.\n\nWhat it says is, under certain circumstances, the Commission \"shall admit any such person as a party to such proceedings.\" It's a directive to the Commission.\n\nAnd it's indisputable here that the Commission didn't admit either Texas or ISP as a party -- I -- I'm -- I'm sorry, Fasken or Texas as a party.\n\nFasken's argument is simply that it should have been admitted.\n\nSecond, Lawyer of Defendant said that when spent nuclear fuel comes out of the reactor, it's too hot to handle or too hot to move.\n\nAnd there is an initial period of at least five years when it has to be placed in a pool, and I'm told that it's rare, though not unprecedented, that the -- the pool is moved. But, after that time, even when the waste is stored at the site of a nuclear reactor, it's often moved into cask storage. It's in the same containers where it would be stored at ISP's facility.\n\nThird, Lawyer of Defendant referred to the 1980 Federal Register notice.\n\nThere was a two-paragraph discussion, I think it's Heading Number 18, offsite versus onsite storage.\n\nBut it was all about policy.\n\nSome commenters said onsite storage is better as a policy matter, some commenters said offsite storage is better as a policy matter.\n\nNo commenter at that time questioned the Commission's statutory authority to choose one or the other or both, and the Commission chose both.\n\nThe next thing I'd refer to is there was a reference to the facilities license that, Judge, I think you asked: How would the ISP facility be illegal if your view of the materials licensing provisions is correct? And the answer was: They would still need a facilities license.\n\nThat's not correct.\n\nThe facilities licensing provisions apply only to production or utilization facilities.\n\nIf you operate a nuclear reactor, you need both a facilities license to operate the reactor and a materials license to possess the -- the relevant stuff. But an ISP -- ISP's proposed facility is not either a production or utilization facility.\n\nAll it needs is the materials license.\n\nAnd it's true that in determining whether to grant the materials license the Commission will examine the nature of the facility, is it safe, is it secure, but that doesn't convert it into a facilities license.\n\nAnd, Judge, you laid out the sequence of events that led to the current understanding or the until-recent understanding that offsite storage is permissible.\n\nAnd I'd add only one, and that's the D.C. Circuit's decision in Bullcreek, which was a little over 20 years ago.\n\nAnd that was when the question whether the Policy Act had superseded the Atomic Energy Act's licensing provisions and precluded offsite storage, it was teed up then.\n\nAnd the D.C. Circuit decided that, no, the Commission's offsite licensing authority remained intact. And we've been another 20 years since then.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "748", "dialogue": "Judge: So that kind of thing might -- going back to the Chief Justice's original question, that's not changing night to night --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I mean --\n\nJudge: -- in the same way.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- it can change over time the same way that a cancer diagnosis could change over time, but --\n\nJudge: And then the other part that was interesting to me is that assuming that's your definition, homelessness lacking a fixed regular address, when someone does have access to a shelter even though they lack a fixed, regular address, the ordinance in that situation, I thought you said, is operating to punish the act of not going to the shelter --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- as opposed to punishing the status of being homeless.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that's -- that's the exact reason that reasonable time, place, manner restrictions aren't a problem because if you have time, manner -- time, place, and manner restrictions what you're doing is punishing the conduct of not going to sleep where you're allowed to go. That rationale doesn't work when someone has nowhere to go.\n\nJudge: And can you speak to whether or not we should really be even getting into this in light of the new Oregon law?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we didn't argue mootness. We made this point in our brief in opposition. We didn't say mootness just because we don't have an injunction under the Oregon law yet and it's not self-executing. I don't think there is any question that the ordinances fall under the Oregon law. I mean, it was intended to codify Martin. It requires that any sort of restrictions on sleeping or resting outside are reasonable with respect to homeless individuals. Clearly the ordinances here don't meet that standard. So I --I -- I certainly wouldn't have any concerns with the Court saying as a matter of constitutional avoidance, it appears this Oregon law resolves this whole issue so, you know, we're dismissing as improvidently granted or however the Court wanted to -- to resolve the case.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: So the plaintiff -- I'm sorry. The plaintiff who died here had used up her provisional stay credits at the time of class certification, so she no longer had a shelter that was willing to take her. I think the hard hypothetical that another judge was positing and in part another judge is the person who owns a dog.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Or let's say a mentally ill person. Do you have the same response as the government?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I -- I would like to live in a world where separating someone from their pet is cruel. But it's outside the scope of our claim because we are just talking about physical and legal access to shelter. So if someone turns down a shelter offer that's physically and legally available because of their dog, they would not be within the scope of our claim. To get to the mental health hypothetical, if a -- if the person's mental health issues made the shelter either physically unavailable to them because if they went there, they would be at substantial risk of bodily harm or death, then I would say the shelter isn't physically available. You could also have a shelter that won't take people with mental health problems, in which case it wouldn't be legally available to them. I would say that if the shelter is physically and legally available, then they're outside the scope of their -- our claim but they might have ADA claims or some other law that applies that would restrict the city's ability to punish them for not going to that place but that's outside our case.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Can you go from having a fixed regular address to not having one?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Can you go from not having one to having one?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Another Judge?\n\nJudge: In a previous case, a narcotics officer testified that based on his experience, the marks on the defendant's arm suggested that he was an addict.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Do we have anything like that where an expert testifies that these people -- that the individuals here are homeless?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So here the legal burden was on the Plaintiffs to show that they were homeless. The lower courts found that their declarations and depositions satisfied that.\n\nJudge: Well, what I'm interested in is the status. You say that this is the equivalent of a previous case. And I'm trying to determine where the status of homelessness was determined and how it plays a role in this case.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So it was determined based on the declarations and depositions of the punitive class members and named plaintiffs. It also, you know, we talked a little about the ratio between beds to population. The lower court ended up rejecting that as a hard and fast rule, but the lack of shelter beds in Grants Pass provides credibility to the putative class members' declarations when they say they have nowhere to go. I'd also say I don't understand the City to have ever contested that the named plaintiffs are homeless. What they contested is whether they had access --\n\nJudge: I think what's confusing me is that when I read the ordinance, the ordinance is an anti-camping ordinance. Would this -- would a -- would a backpacker who happens to be in the area for a few days be allowed to camp on -- on public property?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't --I think theoretically no but I would say that the City has never -- it was not able to identify any circumstance in which it had applied --\n\nJudge: I understand that. But it -- but -- it would apply to a backpacker?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I -- I -- it would depend on the circumstances. The line that the police officers drew in their depositions was that if they saw a non-homeless person lying on a blanket, they wouldn't enforce the ordinance.\n\nJudge: No, I'm saying some -- he's back --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yep. So --\n\nJudge: -- someone with a backpack who's been wandering around for a couple of years, in the continental divide or something.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I can imagine -- I'm putting myself in the place of the officers who were deposed. If you gave them that hypothetical --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: --they might say no, that person isn't setting up a temporary place to live; they're just traveling through town. That --that particular hypothetical didn't come up, but we do --\n\nJudge: So that would not violate the anti-camping ordinance?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't know. I mean, maybe this gets to the vagueness of the --\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: --of the provisions, but --\n\nJudge: Another Judge? Another Judge? Another Judge?\n\nJudge: I think one of the premises of your argument is that this is not good policy for the homeless, and good policy would -- would help homeless individuals transition, get mental health treatment, get substance abuse treatment, job -- job assistance, and that this doesn't -- doesn't fulfill those objectives. And maybe you --maybe you're not saying that, but I'm curious whether you think this is good policy in terms of incentivizing, or bad? You -- you must think it's bad, and I'm curious why.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, I don't think we've made that argument. It certainly came across the amici briefs. I would -- just on the incentivizing, I think, is a non sequitur because the only question here is whether it violates the Eighth Amendment to enforce the ordinances when someone has no access to shelter, when they're turning down the services.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Could you walk through the text and show why your interpretation is consistent with the text?\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—\nJudge: The relevant text?\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah. So the 30 words of text about Barnett Bank—\nJudge: Right.\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —which we've talked about. If we want to talk about \"significantly interfere,\" I think the word \"significant\" does some work because it does a significant amount of work. Not any law that could be said to interfere with the banking power—we've talked about the fair lending laws, talked about the age requirements, the writing requirements—it has to be significant, and it has to go to the authorized federal power.\nJudge: Okay. Is what’s codified the words taken from Barnett Bank, \"significantly interferes,\" et cetera, or is it the holding of Barnett Bank? Is it how Barnett Bank itself understood those words?\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The latter. I think you could say it's both, but it's clearly the latter. I think, in their view, you didn’t have to enact any reference to Barnett Bank because they just start with significant interference.\nJudge: And \"case by case\"?\nDefendant’s Lawyer: \"Case by case\" refers to the OCC in terms of their saying if you're going to proceed by order or regulation, you'd have to just look at escrow laws because it has to be a substantial— I mean, you might have a debate about what's substantially equivalent in escrow laws. But \"case by case\" is not referring to facts. It's referring to you can't just say we want to preempt everything on mortgage loans. You have to look at, like, escrow, down payment, maximum—you have to just go kind of law by law. But it's talking about the OCC.\nJudge: Thank you.\nJudge: Justice, any questions?\nJudge: No.\nJudge: Any other questions?\nJudge: I just— I just have one thing on your distinction because I'm still trying to follow it. You rely on Anderson, and I guess the other case that sort of implicates the same facts as Anderson is the California case—\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Correct.\nJudge: —which you've talked about. And the problem I'm having with your distinction between product or power and the transaction is that in California, the Court describes the law at issue there, which it says is preempted, as a statute that attempts to qualify in an unusual way agreements between national banks and their customers and may cause them to hesitate to subject their funds to possible confiscation. So it seems as though the Court in this case says the reason why you're preempted is because you are trying—this law is trying to regulate the transaction between the bank, which you say is the reason why in Anderson they would say it's not preempted.\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—\nJudge: So I don’t—\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, a hundred percent. And you're completely correct. What we're saying is you have the control on the power of the banking product, and there's a second fallback test, which is the undue burden, and that undue burden is the practical impact. So if you had a state law that said—the difference between California and the Kentucky law—that said the minimum age requirement is 61 to open up a mortgage, well, that is a law of majority. It clearly would impose an unusual relationship on the relationship between the bank and its customers. So we do think you could go and preempt these laws that do interact with the consumer and the state.\n\nAnother one would be a state—national banks or any bank can only be open for one hour during the week. That's going to be preempted. Or you have to pay tellers $1,000 an hour. It's going to be preempted even though, of course, Title VII applies to national banks.\n\nBut I do think the California case leaves open, and Anderson says, if the state law is so unusual with respect to the bank and its consumers to the point that it's interfering with their operations, it will be preempted.\nJudge: Thank you.\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1007", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-1324, Perttu versus Richards.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Exhaustion is the centerpiece of Congress's reforms under the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\r\n\r\nYet, even with this invigorated exhaustion requirement, prisoner lawsuits still account for an outsize share of filings in federal district courts.\r\n\r\nA rule that requires a jury trial on intertwined exhaustion issues would increase this burden while incentivizing non-exhaustion and undermining the goals and structure of the PLRA.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Respondent would have this Court cast aside the PLRA's goals and structure merely because exhaustion is an affirmative defense. Focusing on this Court's holding in Jones versus Bock, he contends that there's no principled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently than other affirmative defenses that are routinely sent to juries when there are facts intertwined with the merits.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Jones does not stand for this broad proposition.\r\n\r\nIt held only that prisoners need not plead exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a principled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently than other affirmative defenses.\r\n\r\nIt is a mandatory prerequisite to suit.\r\n\r\nSo its intended benefits would be entirely undercut by merits discovery and a trial before its resolution.\r\n\r\nPLRXA -- PLRA exhaustion must be resolved by a judge at the early stages of litigation.\r\n\r\nContrary to the Sixth Circuit, this does not run afoul of the Seventh Amendment even when there are intertwined facts.\r\n\r\nThe judge's determination on exhaustion does not interfere with the jury's ultimate fact-finding role because dismissal is typically without prejudice and the judge's determination on exhaustion would not have preclusive effect.\r\n\r\nDefendant: Richards, like many other prisoners, can exhaust, come back, and have a jury decide the merits of any viable claims.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit's decision.\r\n\r\nJudge: Are exhaustion determinations normally made by the judge?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: They are.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, lower courts are pretty much in agreement that at least when there are no intertwined facts, that judges will make those determinations.\r\n\r\nJudge: So what is it about the intertwining of facts that changed the -- changes the nature of exhaustion?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't think there's anything that changes the nature of exhaustion. I think what it does is it -- it -- it makes one have to consider the Seventh Amendment now. If -- if there are intertwined facts, is that an implication of the Seventh Amendment? And our position is that it doesn't and that --\r\n\r\nJudge: So, historically, has there been -- do we have any analogs to -- that would suggest that this would go to a jury?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: No.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the opposite is true, that the analogs suggest that this would go to a judge.\r\n\r\nWe think that the closest analogs -- there is no precise analog. There was no exhaustion in 1791.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine hadn't been developed yet.\r\n\r\nIt came as the administrative setting was coming into force.\r\n\r\nBut we know that exhaustion has its roots in equity.\r\n\r\nAnd we think that the most at least appropriate analogs here are equitable defenses and equitable defenses that would have been --their key characteristic is a deference to another setting, another forum.\r\n\r\nJudge: But, Ms. Sherman, do we really have to get into that? I guess what I was a little confused about from your briefing was that I took you to concede that there's intertwinement here.\r\n\r\nAnd if that's the case, we can just assume, I guess, that exhaustion does not entitle you to a jury.\r\n\r\nThat's the part of this that would ordinarily say you don't get a jury, but it's the fact of intertwinement that brings to the fore the question of whether or not the Seventh Amendment has to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo we don't really have to worry or think about or rule on whether or not the exhaustion claim gets a jury independent of the other one, right?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't think the Court has to rule on that.\r\n\r\nI think it's a question that is naturally embedded in the question presented.\r\n\r\nI mean, obviously --\r\n\r\nJudge: I understand, but if I assume it, okay, so fine, aren't we still faced with the question that you present, as a matter of your question presented, is then we have intertwinement of a claim that does not get a jury, the exhaustion claim, with a claim that does? Do you concede that the First Amendment retaliation claim is one that would ordinarily go to the jury?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: When -- when the right to a jury trial accrues and exhaustion has been met, I agree that that is a claim that should go to the jury.\r\n\r\nAnd this Court has been very clear that 1983 claims are entitled to a jury trial.\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nSo we do have the intertwinement.\r\n\r\nAt least you concede it in your brief.\r\n\r\nAnd so why wouldn't the sort of standard Beacon Theatres view of how we deal with that situation apply here?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Beacon Theatres doesn't apply here for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nOne, Beacon Theatres was driven by a concern for collateral estoppel.\r\n\r\nWould there -- would there be a preclusive effect that would completely cut off any right to have the jury trial on the merits?\r\n\r\nJudge: I don't see that in the opinion.\r\n\r\nI mean, I see that it talks about preclusive effect, but that didn't necessarily seem to me to be driving the analysis.\r\n\r\nAnd we've had a lot of cases that have applied this sort of intertwinement principle in which preclusion really hasn't been the main focus.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think Beacon Theatres itself talked about preclusion, preclusive effect, and that being a concern.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

What's the subject matter --what gives it subject matter jurisdiction to consider the 60(b) motion at all? And the second jurisdictional issue I see is: What gives it subject matter jurisdiction to vacate an arbitrable award? So they chose to go, the Tenth Circuit, on the 60(b).\n\nThat's what we granted cert on.\n\nAnd so I'm assuming that you must think that the jurisdiction over the motion to reopen stems from the original ADEA case?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's right.\n\nJudge:\nAll right.\n\nSo that has been opened.\n\nWhat would have given the district court jurisdiction to vacate the -- an arbitrable award?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight.\n\nJudge:\nBecause I don't think the jurisdiction that's granted by the federal statute or the ADEA is simply to order parties to go to arbitration.\n\nSo what gives it subject matter jurisdiction to vacate the award?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, once the case is reopened, it's a federal case, and --and our - - first, it has jurisdiction because of that.\n\nAnd --\n\nJudge:\nIt has jurisdiction to reopen the ADEA case, but this is no longer an ADEA case.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nSo --\n\nJudge:\nAt least the motion to vacate is not related to anything that's happened in the rights and responsibilities between the two of you with respect to the claim.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, it's related in the sense that it --as the Court looked at the question in Badgerow, the question of -- of a -- a motion to --to vacate an award, and there, of course, the merits were not before the Court, it was a standalone motion to vacate.\n\nAnd that was the premise of the question.\n\nAnd the Court said in that circumstances you need independent subject matter jurisdiction. It didn't speak to whether, if the case -- the merits were before the Court and the case were reopened, there would be a need for an independent -- for subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Breyer, in dissent, noted there -- there may not be.\n\nAnd I -- I didn't read the majority -- the opinion of the Court to say otherwise.\n\nKokkonen itself, upon which Badgerow was based, made very clear --\n\nJudge:\nWell, assume that -- if you assume that -- I think that Badgerow would prevent you from just relying on the federal statute to vacate the arbitration award.\n\nMy understanding of the facts here is that you're going to try to get in through diversity.\n\nIs that right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWe do have diversity.\n\nThe amount in controversy was not pleaded, and -- and the court --whether the court would forgive that is a matter below.\n\nJudge:\nUh -huh.\n\nAnd if -- at any rate, even if you can't --even if you don't have jurisdiction to vacate the arbitration award, because Badgerow says you can't do it based on the federal statute and they're not going to allow you to replead your diversity claim, you know, even assuming that, I take it that what you're saying is that the jurisdictional question as to 60(b) is entirely different?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThat's exactly right.\n\nIt -- none of these issues are -- are obstacles to resolving the question presented.\n\nI'm -- I'm taking them as -- as -- as given, of course.\n\nJudge:\nYeah.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "810", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJudge: I think you said it's a judgment call and a matter of degree. A 10 percent state law, would that be significant interference?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, if it's non-discriminatory -- I'm assuming for purposes of the hypothetical it would be non-discriminatory, although I think requiring that it be non-discriminatory makes it particularly unlikely that a state would ever do something like that.\n\nJudge: I understand.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But indulging the hypothetical, then it would -- we'd be exactly where we are now. It's a question of significant interference, and it would be a question of degree.\n\nJudge: Judgment call for whom? I guess for us, for the nine of us to just decide?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, the question as to what \"significant interference\" means is ultimately a legal question, and it turns on what the actual practical on-the-ground impact is. And if the bank in that scenario said, look—\n\nJudge: If it's a judgment call, who's making the judgment call? Are we making the judgment call or the court of appeals?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It ultimately would be a legal question. And, Justice Alito, you asked earlier about the standard of review. That would be de novo. I mean, to the extent that it rested on factual findings, you know, that would be a different standard. But the ultimate legal question of significant interference is for a court and ultimately, you know, subject to review by this Court.\n\nJudge: And I guess I'm going to go back to Franklin then and say, well, we're not just doing this -- we're not totally at sea when we have to do this under your approach. Franklin says some limits on your advertising and how you describe your product. That is significant interference. And you agree that that's correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that's a way to understand that case. And so, if you wanted to give guidance to lower courts, you could use Franklin National Bank as an example, just as the Barnett Bank Court did in its opinion.\n\nJudge: And I guess, here -- I mean, this -- maybe this is for remand or for us, but telling a bank not how you describe your product in your advertising, but you actually have to pay money that you wouldn't otherwise pay, I mean, that's—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well—\n\nJudge: -- much more direct interference with the operations of the bank, it seems to me. Maybe you have an explanation for that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, then Bank of America, it has -- you know, would be able to, you know, try to carry its burden of establishing that standard on remand.\n\nJudge: Isn't that just -- I mean, do you want -- you'd need a trial. That's just common sense, isn't it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: To tell -- tell someone you have to pay out large sums of money collectively, rather than how you describe your product in your advertising, isn't one more significant interference than the other?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. So I'll take the Franklin side of that question first if I may. So just to be clear about the law in Franklin, it went well beyond advertising and it disabled banks from even being able to use the word \"savings\" in their deposit slips, anywhere in their bank offices. You know, it just eradicated the word or any of its equivalents from the premises of the bank. And I think, you know, what made -- you might think about that as posing a First Amendment problem today. It was also a discriminatory law that gave certain state institutions the ability to use that word. And so it posed a number of distinct problems, but I think ultimately, too, it posed a conflict with the text of the federal statute because the state in that scenario sought to significantly interfere with the exercise and express statutory power that Congress granted.\n\nJudge: The advertising was not an express power. The advertising the Court made clear was an incidental power.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right, but the power that I think ultimately the Court focused on was the express power to accept savings deposits, and in particular, the use of the word \"savings,\" I think, was critical to the Court's analysis.\n\nJudge: Right. And, here, the express power is the lending and the incidental power is the escrow accounts, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The way the Bank of America articulates the power, we're not disputing their articulation of the power for purposes of this Court's decision. It is the power to offer mortgage escrow accounts to consumers.\n\nJudge: Mm-hmm.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the question is the extent to which the law significantly interferes with that power.\n\nJudge: Do you still think McCulloch v. Maryland was correctly decided?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. We have no issue with McCulloch, and it goes a long way to answer that question.\n\nJudge: And why is that correctly decided and this different?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So we point to this in our brief, but there are a couple of key distinctions. That case involved a discriminatory tax on the Second Bank of the United States. And at that time, the Second Bank of the United States functioned more like the Federal Reserve Bank, and it had a really public-facing component. Modern national banks don't really resemble the Second Bank of the United States. And the laws that we have as in this case are not discriminatory laws. And, in any event, it's a question of preemption and it's ultimately Congress that lays down the standard, and the standard is \"prevents or significantly interferes with.\"\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Counsel, you're drawing a distinction which I also saw in your brief between express powers and incidental powers. Can you just explain to me why that matters? And I'll tell you why I'm thinking about it. It almost sounds to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that you're saying that if a power is express, something more like a control test might apply just as a matter of economic logic, but that if it's incidental, we get into this more fact-specific inquiry. Am I understanding your position?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think you're right to point out that we do underscore the fact that this is an incidental power so that Congress hasn't said anything specific on this subject. And, indeed, it's a kind of second-order incidental power that is at issue, which is not just the ability to have the accounts but then, you know, to set the interest rate. And so I think the reason why we're focusing on that is preemption questions typically turn on what Congress says in the text of the statute, and so you want to look at the text of the statute.\n\nJudge: Well, I mean, I do agree with that, but you've characterized Barnett Bank as an express conflict, but Barnett Bank goes out of its way to say we don't have an irreconcilable conflict there. It wasn't that the federal statute said, do X, and the state statute said not X. And so it was about significant interference.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, so in Barnett Bank, you're right that there was an impossibility preemption. It wasn't impossible for the bank to comply with both the federal and state statute. But the Court did say there was an express conflict based on the text of the statute. The Court left no indication that if the law were less than a complete prohibition, it would automatically be preempted under the control test.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "427", "dialogue": "Judge: Fair enough. That doesn't necessarily mean there's a federal cause of action. It could mean it happens under state—common law, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, two—\n\nJudge: I mean, you—you would admit that a state common law cause of action did and could fully vindicate the Fifth Amendment?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, I think there could be a state common law action that vindicated the First Amendment, but I also think—\n\nJudge: Fifth. Fair enough.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor, or—or the First.\n\nJudge: And that that would—that would be enough. No—nothing more would be required.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well—\n\nJudge: And, in fact, that's how it operated for a long time.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, certainly, Your Honor, if compensation is provided through any mechanism, there's no longer a Fifth Amendment injury to be remedied.\n\nJudge: Ah. Okay. I understand that argument. That's not the argument you're—you're pressing, though.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's because, here, compensation hasn't been paid. The plaintiffs in this case continue to suffer the ongoing Fifth Amendment injury.\n\nJudge: Well, maybe that's because you—you—you—you allowed this case to be removed, which I—and—and, you know, I'm—I'm surprised you didn't oppose removal on that ground and said there's no federal question that we need to resolve here because it's really a state common law cause of action we're pursuing. That would have been one option. Or maybe in federal court you might have said we want a declaratory judgment, which everyone concedes you can get under the Fifth Amendment, and take pendent jurisdiction over our state common law cause of action, which would adequately vindicate our Fifth Amendment rights. You didn't pursue either of those courses here.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So two responses, Your Honor. One, I don't think there was a good-faith grounds to oppose Texas's removal because what the complaint says on its face is we are entitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nJudge: Well, but it—it then pleads state causes of action to do so.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, Your Honor. It—it pleads a claim directly under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nJudge: Well, maybe that's another problem you face is it—if you had an adequate common law—do you dispute that Texas has an adequate common law remedy for—for your problem?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I do, Your Honor. And this is actually an important point. That—\n\nJudge: Is that argument in your brief, that—that the—that the common law of Texas or state law has no mechanism to enforce the Fifth Amendment?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, Texas asserts—\n\nJudge: If it did, that one I'd take seriously, but I didn't see it.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So Texas asserts, Your Honor, that there is a Texas common law mechanism to vindicate the Fifth Amendment, but there is no Texas decision saying we sitting as a common law court invoke our common law powers to create a cause of action.\n\nJudge: No trespass, no conversion?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Texas hears inverse condemnation claims arising under the Fifth Amendment. That's what the Texas Supreme Court said most recently in City of Baytown v. Schrock, and it cites the Fifth Amendment. It doesn't invoke its common law powers.\n\nJudge: Fair enough. I get all of that now. All right. That's clarifying. But you—you—the—the nature of the argument before us isn't that Texas lacks a common law cause of action. It's whether or not, Texas has such a thing, we're entitled to another remedy under federal law.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I—I don't think that's right, Your Honor. What the Fifth Circuit said is that the complaint that alleges an entitlement to just compensation flowing from the Fifth Amendment doesn't state a claim, that that claim is dead.\n\nJudge: Let—let—let's suppose it did create a cause of action. Would—would it also waive sovereign immunity? And what would the statute of limitations be?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It wouldn't necessarily waive sovereign immunity, Your Honor. I think that's a distinct question. And the statute of limitations would be the statute of limitations that is applied by lower courts when people actually bring these claims. There's a robust Court of Federal Claims jurisprudence, federal district courts hear claims arising under the Fifth Amendment, sometimes looking to state law to set the statute of limitations.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "860", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff: I did want to touch briefly on the questions about history and tradition here because my friends have said several times that the Communications Act of 1934, which we think is roughly analogous to the type of restriction that Congress was seeking to enact here, is justified entirely by concerns about scarcity, how you can't have sufficient bandwidth.\n\nAnd I, of course, recognize that scarcity is what created the need for a licensing regime in the first place, but I think it's important to clarify the historical record here that in choosing to limit foreign control of radio stations, of broadcast stations, Congress specifically cited a concern about national security.\n\nThat is written into the statute.\n\nNational defense was one of the listed purposes of having that kind of restriction. And so I don't think my friends can succeed in being dismissive of that concern about history and tradition and what it shows about the national security judgments that undergird this law.\n\nThe one other factual point I wanted to make to be responsive to a few points that my friends have touched on relates to whether TikTok U.S. has the ability to alter this algorithm, whether divestiture is feasible, how ByteDance has manipulated the platform in the past.\n\nWith respect to the algorithm, I think we're simply talking past each other.\n\nWe don't dispute that TikTok U.S. might engage in some functions in the United States to customize the algorithm for a U.S. audience.\n\nThe thing we're worried about is happening long before that, over in China, where ByteDance is developing the source code, creating the basic backbone and functioning of the system, and is then blasting out the algorithm for use by the various subsidiaries in their home country.\n\nSo we're not seeking to regulate any activity that TikTok U.S. is engaged in here. Instead, what Congress is doing is trying to close off the vulnerability of PRC access abroad.\n\nWith respect to the feasibility of divestiture, my friends have said it would have been impossible to do this within 270 days.\n\nYou know, at the outset, obviously, there's no inherent impediment to divesting a social media company.\n\nWe just saw Elon Musk buy X, or Twitter, in about six months from offer to completion.\n\nAnd even with respect to this particular company, I think my friends are not well positioned to complain about the timeline because they've been on notice since 2020 that unless they could satisfy the federal government's national security concerns, divestiture might be required.\n\nBut, in any event, I don't think that the Court should fault Congress for trying to balance competing interests here in making sure that there was a period for compliance and trying to preserve access to the platform for Americans while taking steps to safeguard against the risk to national security.\n\nFinally, with respect to the question of whether ByteDance has taken action on the PRC's demands, there is evidence in the record that Congress consulted to demonstrate that outside of China, ByteDance has taken action to misappropriate data at the PRC's request.\n\nThat included efforts to track dissidents in Hong Kong, protestors there, to track Uyghurs in China itself.\n\nWe know that ByteDance has misappropriated U.S. data with respect to surveilling of U.S. journalists.\n\nAnd there was evidence in the record reinforcing the conclusion that ByteDance has been asked by the PRC to undertake efforts to censor content and manipulate the platform at the behest of the Chinese government.\n\nSo I don't think there is a factual basis to dispute the record that Congress had before it.\n\nJudge: Justice Thomas?\n\nJudge: I have a question. General, if I understood correctly, under President-Elect's first term, he passed an executive order requiring divestiture, correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\n\nJudge: And this -- that was challenged in court and stayed as a result of him exceeding his executive power to do that. But this bill followed a bipartisan investigation, correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes, that's right.\n\nJudge: I am a little concerned that a suggestion that a president-elect or anyone else should not enforce the law when a law is in effect and has prohibited certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance other than the change in that law.\n\nBut putting that aside, on the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: And whatever the new president does doesn't change that reality for these companies?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That's right.\n\nJudge: How long is the statute of limitations in effect? Assuming that they violated it that day and later continued to violate it, but how long does the statute of limitations exist for a civil violation --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It --\n\nJudge: -- of this sort?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: It would be a five-year statute of limitations.\n\nJudge: All right.\n\nThank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nFour points, all of which go to why we think this law would fail whether you apply intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny.\n\nI'd like to begin with the least restrictive alternative, simply prohibiting TikTok, Incorporated, from disseminating any of the sensitive user data to anyone, including ByteDance, under the threat of massive penalties.\n\nThat is definitely a less restrictive alternative. Now my friend pointed to the NSA negotiations.\n\nWell, the sensitive user data that we're talking about and that were of concern in the NSA negotiations were not the type of technical data that she's talking about.\n\nThe NSA did allow certain types of nonsensitive technical data to go back and forth, but that wasn't anybody's concern.\n\nAnd, as we say on page 23 of our briefs, they simply cut off the negotiations without ever raising those concerns.\n\nBut, to be clear, if that's a concern, sweep that into the ban too.\n\nPut in that nonsensitive technical data into the ban too. We'll deal with that.\n\nIt's a lot better than simply being forced to shut down.\n\nSo that is most definitely a less restrictive alternative that would address data security.\n\nWe talked about the under-inclusiveness in Temu and Shein, the two large e-commerce sites.\n\nJustice, you might have seen Temu during the Super Bowl.\n\nIt was heavily advertised.\n\nIt's got -- it's one of the most popular e-commerce applications in the United States.\n\nIt's got 70 million users.\n\nJustice, you were asking what they collect.\n\nThis is from Joint Appendix 339 to 343, the U.S./China Economic and Security Commission Review Report.\n\nShein relies on tracking and analyzing user data, draws on customer data and search history with the assistance of artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\nIt requests users share their data and activity from other apps, including social media.\n\nSo they apparently go into your social media apps and suck up all of the information. Because they're e-commerce apps, they take names, addresses, and credit card information.\n\nIf you look at the privacy policies on their website, they were -- they collect location data.\n\nIt -- it looks like they might even collect at some level GPS location data.

I don't think that's necessarily the case. I won't say it's impossible, but this is my answer to the previous question. There are very few states that have or -- or in the federal code that have facts beyond the prior conviction itself that trigger enhancements that are -- that are currently in the law found by judges. So I think it's very uncommon. And, of course, there will be further guidance presumably in this opinion for federal and state judges, so I think it's very unlikely you're going to see additional cases just because those laws are so uncommon.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: As I think the discussion so far this morning has demonstrated, as we see it, this case boils down to an unavoidable syllogism, which is that under Wooden, the different occasions finding under the ACCA requires a multi-factored inquiry involving the timing, the proximity of location, and the character and relationship of prior offenses, whereas the Sixth Amendment prohibits, to use the words in Mathis, exploring the manner in which a prior conviction's offense occurred. And we therefore think that because a district judge is disempowered from doing it, the only option left is that the jury has to do it, and so we have acknowledged that a jury would need to do that. I'm happy to take the Court's questions, but I don't think the Court needs to or, frankly, should say much more than that to resolve this case.\n\nJudge: Well, wouldn't it be cleaner, though, to just simply overrule Almendarez-Torres?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I had a suspicion you might ask me that question, Your Honor. (Laughter.) And as you might anticipate, your suspicion might have been my answer is no, and the reason why is that we don't -- we think Almendarez-Torres is correct, but it's also a precedent this Court has adhered to for 25 years post-Apprendi, always acknowledging this. Nobody's asked the Court to overrule it in this case. There's no need for the Court to overrule it in this case. And we therefore just leave it the way it is.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: To address some of the questioning from the Court, we don't think very many Almendarez-Torres questions are really going to come up in practice. We do think that it means a bit more than I think my colleague thinks it means, but our principal interest here is actually in the type of cases that are currently before the Court in the Brown and Jackson cases, which involve the comparison of state predicates to federal predicates and some timing questions that come up with those. And that situation's already covered by McNeill. It's clear that a court can find what version of the statute was applied to the defendant at the time of the prior conviction, so --\n\nJudge: Do you want to say why you think Almendarez-Torres is correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't really want to turn this into relitigation of Almendarez-Torres, which, again, even the Defendant has not asked for, but we think the Court was correct. There are more states that I think support that than my colleague would acknowledge. There are clear precedents from multiple states. And although some of those statutes allow for jury trials on the back end, that was all historical evidence that was in front of the Court in Almendarez-Torres, and the Court found that there was at least enough non-uniformity on the issue to allow legislatures some flexibility on this topic.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Section 2401's limitations period starts when a claim \"first accrues.\" This Court has said that phrase means the clock starts only once a plaintiff can sue, and this Court has also said that an APA plaintiff can sue only once it's first harmed by regulation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We just want the Court to apply those settled principles. By contrast, the government wants a special rule that contradicts how accrual statutes have worked since at least the 1830s. That government-only carveout would convert Section 2401 into a repose-based statute like the Hobbs Act.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But Congress knows exactly how to craft repose-based statutes when it wants to, and it hasn't done so for APA claims.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Second, with no textual foothold, the government resorts to policy arguments. It says that siding with Corner Post will undermine reliance interests because it will let plaintiffs challenge rules that are older than six years.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But challenges to those rules already happen all the time in the as-applied context, and the government admits that as-applied challenges have no time limit.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Third, if Congress's textual choice leads to outcomes that the government doesn't like, this Court has said that those concerns should be addressed to Congress, not to this Court.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: This Court's role is simply to enforce the value judgments that Congress has already made. We ask that it do so here. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Do you have any examples of accrual cases or questions where the injury and the unlawful conduct are on different dates?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, that’s really any typical accrual statute. For example, there are torts where a tort is committed and the cause of action is not complete until later, until the harm is felt. So that's a basic. We think there's nothing remarkable about that fact pattern.\n\nJudge: Well, but how many cases are like yours, where the regulation has been adopted, it's final, and you are not yet in business, so it can't apply to you? Are there any cases like yours where the injury is later?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: -- where the injury occurs long after the rule is adopted?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So there's the Herr case in the Sixth Circuit, which starts the circuit split in this context. That's one case where it happened.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But I think the question, unless I'm misunderstanding it, is are there any other statutes of limitations that operate the way we say that 2401 does?\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So we think that 20 -- we're not aware of any --\n\nJudge: Actually, I'm more interested in the fact pattern that we have here. Your business -- you have a rule that's adopted. It's final. It's been challenged. Then you go into business, you begin to operate under these rules, and you claim, of course, that's the beginning of your injury, and then you say that restarts the statute of limitations.

{"id": "497", "dialogue": "Judge: I want to follow up on the previous question. If we say there is an industry requirement and shift our focus to the industry, does that make your argument harder regarding last-mile drivers? Would workers in the industry automatically be included if the industry is engaged in interstate commerce?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, I don’t think so. We see the industry issue as a threshold condition—necessary but not sufficient. The Saxon analysis would still be required. This distinction is important because it excludes cases involving manufacturers, which have historically been off-limits under Section 1. It’s crucial to prevent a flood of new cases that were previously considered outside this scope.\n\nJudge: Before 1925, were there workers who were not covered by any arbitration regime?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Are you referring to industry workers?\n\nJudge: I think the question is about seamen who didn’t work for maritime shipping companies. Did they fall into a gray area where they weren’t covered by any arbitration regime?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Just to clarify, are you referring to seamen who were outside the Shipping Commissioners Act or not part of the shipping industry? That would include recreational boats and those on coastwise voyages, like lumber schooners. These would traditionally be considered manufacturers, and they would be outside the Shipping Commissioners Act. However, there are no cases interpreting this Act, so we have to draw analogies from the rail industry.\n\nJudge: And in the rail industry, it was relatively clear that a worker had to be an employee of the railroad?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes, that was crystal clear. The federal arbitration provisions governing railroad employees required them to be employed by a common carrier. The same reasoning applied in Saxon, where a cargo loader was considered part of interstate commerce based on cases involving rail common carriers.\n\nJudge: If you lose this case, how many workers and companies would be affected?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The impact would be massive. In the past five years, new cases have emerged involving franchise restaurants, medical industries, and the entire food industry. For example, medical supplies need rapid shipment, and food products like bread and beer require point-to-sale distribution. Retail industries that manage their own warehouses would also be affected. This expansion would disrupt industries that have never been subject to such arbitration rules.\n\nJudge: Couldn’t this issue be addressed through other legal doctrines?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Not under the last-mile analysis, which is the main question here. These companies ship goods across state lines, and the historical understanding has been that Section 1 applies specifically to the transportation industry. Even in Saxon, the definition of seamen under Section 1 was based on a subset of the maritime shipping industry.\n\nJudge: This might be a straightforward case for the lower court, but will it be as clear-cut in future cases? Won’t this lead to difficult line-drawing problems?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, 95% of these cases are straightforward. Companies like FedEx, UPS, and major freight carriers are clearly part of the shipping industry. Amazon, which ships both its own goods and others’ products, also falls under this category.\n\nJudge: But what about companies where only a portion of their business—say 30%—involves transportation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The Saxon test could apply here. If transportation is a frequent and substantial part of their business, they might be included. The test is no more complex than Saxon but provides an additional limitation to exclude cases that were previously not part of federal jurisdiction.\n\nJudge: Are you saying that industry changes over time have made the legal language outdated?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1008", "dialogue": "Judge: In this case, there is evidence from which one could infer that the magistrate would not have issued an arrest warrant were it not for the felony charge as to which there was no probable cause. But it does strike me that in many other cases, it will be very difficult—and I don't know how a plaintiff would prove that the charge for which there was no probable cause was the one that resulted in the decision to arrest as opposed to just issuing a summons.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I appreciate that it may be difficult for the plaintiff to make that showing, and since it's an element of the claim, the failure to make the showing would mean that the plaintiff would lose. But I could point out a few ways in which a plaintiff might be able to make that showing.\n\nFirst, if there's a bail determination and the judge sets higher bail because of a felony charge that was added to a misdemeanor charge, but it turns out that the felony charge was fabricated, that might be a circumstance where it's possible to show that the felony charge was the cause of the detention.\n\nIn addition, state law might provide that certain minor offenses result only in a citation or a summons, but more serious offenses can result in pretrial detention. That's another way in which the plaintiff could make that showing.\n\nUltimately, however, it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nJudge: Presumably, the plaintiff would not be able to depose the magistrate and ask the magistrate, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right. We see this kind of inquiry in other areas of criminal procedure. For example, in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, you ask what the court would have done but for counsel's error, or in a Brady claim, what the jury would have done but for the suppression of particular evidence.\n\nAnd you don't have people deposing the judge or the jury. You just ask objectively what would have happened in those circumstances. We envision a similar inquiry here.\n\nJudge: So, to make sure that I understand your response, because I was trying to figure out from your brief exactly what your position was and if it was distinct from the respondent’s.\n\nYou see it as kind of a but-for inquiry, like you don't see it as asking, \"Would it have been reasonable to detain him, say, for four days based on these two misdemeanors?\" You think the right inquiry is to say, \"Would he, in fact, have said four days is sufficient?\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Would the magistrate, in fact, have authorized the additional detention?\n\nAnd the bail example might make that particularly clear, what the distinction between us and the respondents would be. We would say if the magistrate says, \"I'm issuing this higher bail,\" which it turns out the defendant can't pay because of the felony charge, that should be enough to show that that's an unreasonable seizure if the felony was a fabricated charge.\n\nBut I take the respondents to be saying that if the magistrate could have simply denied bail outright as a matter of federal constitutional law, then there's no Fourth Amendment violation.\n\nJudge: But just to make sure I have this right, you do not think that we should engage on that issue?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: And why not?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It's not been the focus of the briefing, and it's not what the court below decided.\n\nIn addition, the unreasonable seizure question raises a variety of nuanced issues, for example, distinguishing between a fabricated charge that was presented to the magistrate and a fabricated charge for which there was probable cause that wasn't presented to the magistrate.\n\nDistinguishing between the first 48 hours after the arrest and the pretrial detention that happens after, between bail and other procedures that might happen during the pretrial procedure.\n\nIt's just too complicated to get into without briefing.\n\nJudge: And as to the two questions that you think we should address, the one that the plaintiff’s lawyer agrees with, and then you added that, of course, this would have to cause a seizure—but there's no disagreement on that one either, is there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I take the plaintiff’s lawyer to be suggesting that it's also possible to bring the Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim under the warrant clause based on the issuance of a warrant that's never executed and when no seizure was—\n\nJudge: I see. I took the plaintiff’s lawyer to say something like, \"We should just leave that to the side.\" And you think we shouldn't leave that to the side?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that the Court should say that to bring this particular type of claim—the Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim—an unreasonable seizure is required. That’s in Thompson itself.\n\nOf course, there may be a separate claim under the warrant clause that's cognizable under 1983, but that may have a different common law analog. It may be that the common law analog for that isn't malicious prosecution.\n\nThere's a separate tort that I found preparing for this case called malicious procurement of a warrant. Maybe that's the appropriate analog. That's why we suggested you limit your focus to the seizure provision.\n\nJudge: But you're saying we should not—just to piggyback on the last question—you would have us stop at just saying that for this kind of claim, the baseless charge has to have caused an unreasonable seizure, but not get into how one would go about proving that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct. That would be enough to resolve the circuit split.\n\nJudge: I took the plaintiff’s lawyer to be agreeing with all of that. So maybe I'll just put in a request with the plaintiff’s lawyer to say on rebuttal whether they agree with all of that.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "20", "dialogue": "Judge: So you would say, first, we knock off the any-crime. Then we say that there has to be a showing of causation as to the detention or the seizure. But then you want us to go further than the Solicitor General by saying what the right way to show causation is. Is that right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, certainly not the right way in every case, but I think the way we ask you then to apply the rule you would set out is according to existing Fourth Amendment precedents. And even if you weren't willing to go ahead and apply the rule in this case, we do think the Court should make clear that when past rulings recognized a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim, they weren’t recognizing a brand-new body of Fourth Amendment law that was going to create standards different from other areas. We think the applicability of reasonability should continue to be as it already is in the Fourth Amendment.\n\nJudge: So how is it that it applies here? Can you—so what is your standard for causation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we just think it's the application of ordinary Fourth Amendment principles. So you would look at the warrant, just as you do under Franks, and exclude the information that is alleged to be false. It's alleged to be the malicious prosecution evidence, if you will. And you would look at what remains, and you would ask whether there is probable cause and whether that supports the detention.\n\nJudge: But I guess, to look at ordinary principles, a lot of those ordinary principles come up in a different context. So it's hard to really say that they should translate and drive the analysis here. I mean, I had a whole discussion with the opposing counsel about false arrest, probable cause, and what we look at and what we care about being different than the probable cause element. And I understand we're talking about the causation element, but the gravamen of a malicious prosecution claim is not the same as the gravamen of an unlawful arrest claim.\n\nAnd so when you're thinking about unreasonableness from the standpoint of causation, I guess I'm a little worried about treating them the same.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the Fourth Amendment, as we know, prohibits unreasonable seizures but not unreasonable charges. And we think that's the difference.\n\nJudge: No, but isn’t it—in the malicious prosecution context, the malicious and unreasonable charge has caused, as you say, the unlawful seizure. And so when we're looking at causation, it's very hard for me to understand how you can take out of the picture, as you did with your definition, the malicious prosecution. The opposing counsel is saying that when you have a malicious initiation of charges, that sort of taints the process.\n\nAnd it's almost like you have to presume that almost everything that happened afterward was tainted by that, unless we have clear evidence that you could have proceeded without the malicious prosecution. And you seem to be saying the opposite in a way.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that those same kinds of arguments could have been put forward, I think were put forward, in previous cases about the way we handle this in the context of a false arrest. And the answer was a Fourth Amendment answer about reasonableness, and that Fourth Amendment reasonableness does not depend on the subjective intent of a particular officer.\n\nJudge: But that’s because that’s not a malicious prosecution scenario. I mean, this is the precise point, right? When you take the jurisprudence that relates to the reasonableness of just an unlawful arrest, I understand what you're saying. We're not focusing on the intent of the officer; we're looking at the circumstances and whether an objective officer in those circumstances would have arrested you and behaved that way.\n\nBut when you’re beginning in the world of malicious prosecution, the thing that we care about is the intent and the maliciousness and what the process is doing to you for baseless reasons. And so once we’re starting there, it seems to me you can’t really judge the causation by those other standards, by standards that say, well, we don’t really care what the officer was thinking. We’ve already crossed that bridge because we’re in the world of malicious prosecution.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that past rulings answer this question by requiring that there be an unreasonable seizure because those cases were locating the claim in the Fourth Amendment or at least acknowledging it as a type of Fourth Amendment claim that could be brought. And I think the kinds of things you're discussing might be more at home in the Fourteenth Amendment. But it’s not been a part of our Fourth Amendment analysis.\n\nJudge: If we do what the Solicitor General proposes and say, you know, the any-crime rule is not valid, but you do have to show causation and that this caused a seizure to make out the Fourth Amendment claim, what happens on remand? What arguments, then, do you make?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think on remand, we would continue to argue, as I would ask the Court to also state, that existing Fourth Amendment principles apply. And so the question is whether his detention is justified by probable cause.\n\nJudge: And so this would be the discussion you’re having now, saying that we look at it objectively and we say: Was this four-day detention reasonable if we remove the money laundering charge? Would it have been reasonable to hold him for four days for these two misdemeanors?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, that’s exactly right. So you would ask, based on the probable cause that we know is determined by a neutral and detached magistrate at the issuance of the warrant, whether the probable cause in those two charges justifies the entirety of his detention.\n\nJudge: Does it get tricky? I mean, I'm not sure any of our precedent squarely addresses this point. When do we stop thinking about the Fourth Amendment and start thinking about, say, speedy trial rights? Or is this—was he held so long that we're violating the Sixth Amendment? Or was the fine so high it’s actually an excessive fine problem? Is all this really a Fourth Amendment issue?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think the recognition that pretrial detention could be a Fourth Amendment claim arises in 2017 with past rulings. Some of these questions may be a bit new. I do think in the past, the Court has resolved some questions about length of detention by asking at some point if that detention becomes punishment and then it's punishment without conviction. And that can fall under other provisions of the Constitution.\n\nJudge: I would just like to understand better—if we were to remand for some sort of causation showing here, exactly what your argument would be. Would it be that probable cause existed sufficient on the two charges that remained and that would be enough to justify four days? Or would it be that there’s probable cause under any laws that we can point to that would suffice to support four days?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, first, obviously, I don’t want to exclude on remand that we might make lots of arguments. But I think the argument I'm making today is that the two charges that were the subject of the warrant supply probable cause—not some kind of uncharged conduct or under any law.\n\nJudge: I guess I’m wondering why that would be the case under your logic. If we’re trying to import Fourth Amendment principles further into this malicious prosecution claim, it seems like a false arrest scenario. And in false arrest cases, we don’t always limit ourselves to the indictment or charge. We look at whether there was probable cause to support the detention, period.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. I think in this case, it wouldn’t be enough to look at uncharged conduct because the seizure lasted more than 48 hours. So there wouldn’t be a probable cause determination by a neutral and detached magistrate as to uncharged conduct. And that’s why you couldn’t do what you could otherwise do in the false arrest context.\n\nJudge: Well, not necessarily looking at uncharged conduct, but the claims the government might bring. Why would you be limited on that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Maybe I’m failing to understand the question, but I think when the government is holding someone beyond 48 hours—\n\nJudge: No, you’ve got to come up with a crime. But there are a lot of crimes out there, not just the ones you charged.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s correct, but this is all after the fact. And so here, we know the detention went beyond 48 hours. We are limited to claims that were charged.\n\nJudge: Okay. All right. Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "942", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 22-585, Culley versus Marshall. Counsel, you may proceed.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court. The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings? The answer is Mathews.\n\nMathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. The Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case.\n\nThe opposing side prefers Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But their primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. They are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing.\n\nOnly Mathews can answer the sufficiency of process question. The courts of appeals and state supreme courts that have addressed the question have overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker. The point of Mathews is to ensure that laws adequately protect the Constitution's fundamental due process guarantee, taking into account the private and governmental interests at stake. It's not to micromanage state legislatures.\n\nThe easiest way for a jurisdiction to ensure its laws comport with due process, as the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained, is generally to offer a reasonably prompt post-seizure hearing to allow claimants to raise an innocent owner argument. Numerous states have done just that, and their experience makes clear that retention hearings are workable and effective. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Before we get to the choice between Barker and Mathews, isn’t there an antecedent question as to whether or not there’s any constitutional requirement for additional hearings in the context of forfeiture?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Your Honor, I think that question is what Barker or Mathews, depending on which test this Court would choose, is meant to answer.\n\nJudge: The reason I ask is because you seem to assume that an additional hearing is required.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We’re not assuming that an additional hearing is required. We’re saying that Mathews is the way to analyze whether an additional hearing is required. Mathews is the test that the Court has applied in cases like Good, where a litigant comes forward and says the process being provided—in that case, no hearing—is insufficient.\n\nJudge: If you had filed a motion for summary judgment a week after the property had been taken or the forfeiture proceedings began, would you be here?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think we would still be here.\n\nJudge: Why? You would have your property back because you won on summary judgment, right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: We won on summary judgment after going through discovery with the state, which, by the way, took five months to respond to our discovery requests.\n\nJudge: But if you got your property back, what would be the due process problem?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: If we had promptly gotten our property back within days or weeks rather than months or years, then in that situation, I think we probably would not have a constitutional claim.\n\nJudge: So, under Alabama’s procedures, you could have gotten your property back in a reasonable time?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Hypothetically, we could have. But due process doesn’t depend on whether a court is going to exercise its discretion to expedite a case. Realistically, courts rarely do that. And, moreover, summary judgment is about proving your ultimate entitlement on the merits definitively.\n\nJudge: Do we have any evidence about how long or how often courts in Alabama grant motions to expedite in this context?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Your Honor, there is not a record on that. As a practical matter, it is not very common. However, in terms of applying the Mathews factors, that is something that could be considered and developed on remand to assess the value of additional procedures. The key methodological question here is how we determine whether an additional hearing is required—do we apply the Mathews factors, the traditional test for due process in civil cases, or do we take a different approach?\n\nJudge: Can we go back to your answer? The purpose of summary judgment is to decide the ultimate question—who owns the car, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: The purpose of a post-seizure hearing is to determine who keeps custody of the car, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: And the focus is different? The hearing may involve disputed issues of fact regarding ownership, the government might claim it needs discovery, or it may argue it has evidence requiring further investigation. The court would then weigh whether those factors justify withholding the car from the owner pending a final determination, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

And what wouldn't be a proceeding?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nWell, I think it's a belts-and-suspenders approach to making sure that there was broad authority to --\n\nJudge:\nSo, yes, it does swallow it, but we should overlook that?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nWell, it's a virtue, so I don't know that I would --\n\nJudge:\nIt's a virtue, not a vice.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nAll right.\n\nGot it.\n\nI got it, I think.\n\nAnd then Microsoft, how do you deal with that, where this Court said that a dismissal with prejudice wasn't a final decision for purposes of 1291?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nRight.\n\nSo I think this goes to an argument my friends make, which is to try to import the concept of finality from appeals to --\n\nJudge:\n60(b).\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\n-- 60(b).\n\nAnd I think a couple of points in response, and we make them in our brief.\n\nThe first one is that the -- the -- the rule-makers used different words.\n\nThey didn't use final decisions, final decisions subject to appeal. They made very clear initially that it covered whatever California covered, which is everything. And then the word \"final\" was added later to make clear that the courts' authority over interlocutory matters was not constrained.\n\nSo that history and the way the -- where the words come from impart a very different meaning.\n\nSo that's number one.\n\nNumber two --\n\nJudge:\nNumber one's good enough for me.\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nOkay.\n\nJudge:\nJudge Matheson's dissent and his boomerang theory of finality --\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\n-- which you seem to embrace, so I -- I -- I don't mean it pejoratively, but that things can become final, you didn't make that argument here.\n\nYou're asking us, as I understand it, to hold that there was always a final proceeding.\n\nIt didn't -- it didn't mature into finality due to later events.\n\nIs that right?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nSo ours wins under both standards.\n\nAnd we took -- we -- we -- we endorsed, I think, something closer to Yesh from the Fifth Circuit --\n\nJudge:\nYeah.\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\n-- which looks at finality when made.\n\nBut we would win under Judge Matheson --\n\nJudge:\nYou would take it if you had to.\n\nGot it.\n\nOkay.\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nAnd -- and, as I mentioned, if finality turns on the limitation period, in this case, when the dismissal was initially made, the -- the limitation period's already applied.\n\nSo even that standard would be met.\n\nJudge:\nThank you, Mr. Levy.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\nCan you walk us through the enactment history and, in particular, the -- the significance of the addition of \"final\"?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nSo, initially, as I said, the -- in 1937, the statute -- the -- the rule, I'm sorry, covered judgments, orders, or proceedings.\n\nThe advisory committee notes made clear that's taken from the California decisions, and Professor Moore has said in various places at the time that the California decisions are authoritative.\n\nBetween 1937 and 1946, some courts were reading Rule 60(b) to apply to interlocutory matters so that if a -- if a -- a decision were made or an order taken along the way, that --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\nIn an open, pending case?\n\nDefendant Lawyer:\nIn an open, pending case. That the movant would have to show a mistake, fraud, or the like under Rule 60(b), and, otherwise, the court would be without authority.\n\nAnd Professor Moore, in -- in the article that is referenced in the advisory committee notes, says that's wrong because, as this Court had said in 1922 in the John Simmons Company case, courts retain plenary inherent authority to revisit interlocutory matters and that's how it should be.\n\nAnd so, for that reason, Professor Moore recommended, and that was ultimately taken up, that the word \"final\" be added to Rule 60(b) not to limit Rule 60(b) but, rather, to make sure that inherent -- that interlocutory matters would always be subject to reopening, unconstrained by Rule 60(b).\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "83", "dialogue": "Judge: Bad facts make bad law, and I fear we may be headed that way. We know there are abuses of the forfeiture system. We know it because it's been documented throughout the country repeatedly of the incentives that police are given to seize property to keep its value as opposed to issues of probable cause or issues of legitimacy of the seizure, okay?\n\nJudge: We also know that that incentive has often led to months, if not years, of retention of property that ultimately gets returned to the owner because there was either no probable cause or because of the innocent owner defense.\n\nJudge: So the question before us is, if we make a determination to take the dicta in Von Neumann and in the other case to say that's the entire process you're ever due, do we leave open the possibility that there are states, jurisdictions that are abusing this process and not leaving us any arms to correct it? That's what we're doing, isn't it?\n\nJudge: If we say there's no overriding first question—is this process, the features of this process, enough, whether it's under Mathews or Barker—then what we're basically saying is go at it, states, take as much property as you want, keep it as long as you want, let's hold out no hope whatsoever that there's ever going to be any further process that's due? That's the bottom line, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that's right, and I think that the Court should hold here that Mathews is the way to analyze the statute.\n\nJudge: I know that's—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But the—\n\nJudge: —what you want, but the point is that if we take that dicta in a case where none of the process itself was at issue, it was a separate process that was at issue or timing of that process, none of the features of the process is at issue as binding on us, we're throwing up our hands and saying due process does not give people any protection whatsoever under any set of circumstances?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that's right. And I think the Court shouldn't do that here regardless of the facts.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I also think on the facts—and I don't want to wear out my welcome—but I also think—\n\nJudge: You are wearing out your welcome—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: —because, like the other judge, that's not the question before us, whether the process here was enough or not.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s right. I do think that there are explanations for the timeline that took place in this case, but the Court doesn’t need to reach that. All the Court needs to decide here is that Von Neumann and the other case—\n\nJudge: There are—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —didn't foreclose any and all potential due process claims that one might bring, and Mathews is the way to think about whether additional process is due in this context.\n\nJudge: Now, after Krimstock, there are jurisdictions that have looked at these issues under the Mathews test and not required retention hearings, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right. There are different ways in which states might potentially satisfy due process. It doesn’t absolutely have to be a retention hearing.\n\nJudge: That’s what I’m saying, which is it depends on each state's assessment of the factors that Mathews looks at, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s right.\n\nJudge: And some have not. Some have required others given the uniqueness of their jurisdictions, correct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s right.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Could I just ask you to clarify that? Because I was confused when I read your brief about how exactly you want Mathews v. Eldridge to work, whether you want it to be a determination in each individual case as to whether, under the Mathews factors, a retention hearing is required, or whether Mathews operates to set up certain categorical rules, and, if so, what those categorical rules are. Are they likely to be state-by-state rules? How does Mathews work in this context?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it does apply at a more categorical level, and that, in fact, is one of the advantages of Mathews over Barker, is that it can apply at a more categorical level and provide some guidance to the states, whereas Barker is inherently retrospective and looks just at the individualized delay in one particular case.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The categorical level at which I think Mathews applies, it would make sense to think of it about car owners in jurisdictions with an innocent owner defense. I think that’s the level at which it applies.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But it’s not a nationwide rule that would require a precise copy of Krimstock hearings in all 50 states. It would allow flexibility for states under Mathews to come up with different ways to potentially satisfy the due process guarantee.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Again, the question is, is there a due process question even to ask? And Mathews tells us that there is.\n\nJudge: Just on that methodological question again, the other side, of course, emphasizes precedent, but they also say that what process is due can't just be a policy question. And they look at history and say that, historically, this kind of interim hearing has not been required by the federal government or the states. There have been lots of different approaches.\n\nJudge: And they say that even today, Alabama is not an outlier. There are lots of different approaches in the states. The states' amicus brief really highlights this. So they say, if we went your way, we would be constitutionalizing a policy question that for over 200 years has been left with the states and the federal government, handled in different ways.\n\nJudge: So I just want you to respond to that overarching theme that I think is in the Solicitor General's brief, in Alabama's brief, and the states' amicus brief.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If I could make two points in response to that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: One, as we've been discussing, the application of Mathews would allow for some amount of continued flexibility by the states. We're not asking the Court to dictate a national rule that a particular type of hearing is required within a particular time period. There will still be room for states to experiment and to customize what they think is an appropriate time and an appropriate kind of hearing, or perhaps even a substitute for a hearing, like a hardship determination that could potentially be made based on a paper filing. So we're leaving room for flexibility.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The second point, with respect to history, I don't think the history provides a clear answer for us here. First, at common law, property could be forfeited regardless of whether the owner was innocent. The innocent owner defense is something that didn't exist at common law. And, again, that gives rise to new procedural protections.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Second, as one of the judges previously explained in a prior case, historical forfeiture laws were quite limited. They were limited to a few specific subject areas, like customs and piracy, where it made some sense to think about in rem proceedings. Civil forfeiture today bears little resemblance to that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Additionally, at the founding, forfeiture proceedings had to move quickly. The Institute for Justice brief explains that courts had to rule within 14 days of the filing date at common law. And so, again, you didn't have this sort of question of months- or years-long delays.\n\nJudge: Oh, okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: Well, keep going then. I don't want you to keep going forever, but—\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The only last point I was going to make is that forfeiture at common law was also considered against a backdrop that the founders had of distrust to civil forfeiture generally based on what the British were doing before the revolution.\n\nJudge: Well, I mean, I'll end it by just saying the early federal statutes seem somewhat inconsistent with that, but I'll leave that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "359", "dialogue": "Judge: Last -- last question. I -- I'm totally sympathetic to the idea that there might be a necessity defense in these cases, and there's a footnote in your brief that indicates that in a lot of cases you could -- you could maybe bring advance preliminary injunctive action at least as individuals. And I don't even see why you couldn't do it on a class-wide -- a class-wide -- basis.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, we haven't ruled out class, we haven't ruled out class.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought you did in that footnote. You said, you know, the -- the whole mistake here is that this was done on a class-wide basis. Why couldn't they?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I think without -- without -- without sufficient inquiry into the individual circumstances is what, particularly with the two class representatives here.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: You just said a minute ago that a lot of this is taken care of on the ground as a practical matter. And I think one of the questions is, who takes care of it on the ground? Is it going to be federal judges, or is it the local jurisdictions with -- working with the nonprofits and religious organizations? So I guess following up on the necessity question, given the line-drawing problems that we've been going through, if a state has a traditional necessity defense, won't that take care of most of the concerns, if not all, and, therefore, avoid the need for having to constitutionalize an area and have a federal judge superintend this rather than the local community, which you've emphasized many times working with the nonprofits and charitable and religious organizations, which is how it works in most places?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I -- I think that the necessity defense at least traditionally has required a much stronger sense of urgency and imminence than -- than this. If states had a necessity defense and we knew that it was available in all of these places, but even in -- in Oregon, I think it's a case called Barrett, the Court said it's theoretically possible, but there was a remand for factual issues. So we don't -- we don't know at this point in time whether -- whether there is such a defense. And that's really not in the -- in the -- in the case here.\n\nThis comes up on an Eighth Amendment challenge without -- without reference to the necessity defense and, frankly, without reference to the new Oregon statute, which seems highly instructive in terms of time, manner, and place that jurisdictions, Grants Pass should examine.\n\nBut I -- I don't think we can -- I don't think the Court should put this core point about Robinson to one side because, in -- the possibility that in Oregon and maybe, you know, maybe no other place, I don't know about California law of necessity, maybe it would be taken care of. I think, at this point in time, that is too speculative to --\n\nJudge: Well, usually we think about before constitutionalizing an area or extending a constitutional precedent, you might disagree with that characterization, but before doing that, we usually think about whether state law, local law already -- already achieves those purposes so that the federal courts aren't micromanaging homeless policy.\n\nAnd it's -- and it's on a daily basis when you work with the homeless. It's a daily issue, how many people are going to show up that day at the food bank, how many people are going to show up that day at the shelter. So it's not like this is a once-a-year thing.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, no. For -- for the people actually dealing with it day to day, that is certainly true, the City, the law enforcement, the City liaisons, the nonprofits, but it's not true for the federal court. The federal court doesn't have to get into any of that.\n\nThe only time the federal court would get into it is when -- is if the core principle of Robinson was being disregarded by not -- by criminalizing somebody for sleeping outside when they have no place to sleep inside. That's the core principle. That's the only thing a court should be enforcing, not the -- not whether people -- whether people show up.\n\nAnd the thing I would -- another thing I would say about the necessity defense, it -- it may be that if the Court issues an appropriate injunction in this case or another case limited to the core principle of Robinson, but it develops or the state law develops that there is a necessity defense, then I think that should be taken into account.\n\nI mean, that's in effect the time, manner, and place or -- or similar to that. If state law comes -- comes along and establishes a -- a realistic defense or a realistic approach to how people can remain in the -- in the community, then the courts obviously should defer to that.\n\nBut we don't have that established state law at this time. And I don't think the Court should decline to address this question, which is important in the Ninth Circuit, both because the principle that those courts recognize should be sustained but the approach they've taken should not.\n\nJudge: Last question I have on the food hypotheticals about stealing to feed yourself or cooking to feed yourself. You kind of waved all those away by, oh, that's all taken care of by local communities, nonprofits, and religious organizations, and by and large, heroic efforts each day to make sure that happens, but it doesn't always happen by any stretch.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: No, it -- it doesn't always happen.\n\nJudge: And then what?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But homeless people are resourceful. They have friends who are also homeless. They may -- they may know people in town. They may beg for money. And the -- the towns are -- are coping in the same way, frankly, that individual homeless people do. They do the best they can under the circumstances, but that -- if those circumstances fail and the nonprofits, et cetera, can't -- you know, the truck doesn't show up one night, that doesn't become an Eighth Amendment problem.\n\nAnd -- and we're by no means suggesting that there should be a federal judiciary overlay on top of all that. The cities and the nonprofits should be left alone to do the work that they're doing, unless the core principle of Robinson is not respected.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: So one odd thing about the posture of this case, putting aside the class part, is its pre-enforcement nature, because in Robinson and in Powell too, the punishment -- you know, the -- the adjudication of guilt had already occurred and it was time for the punishment to be imposed, and then the Eighth Amendment challenge was raised.\n\nAnd another judge was asking you about a lot of the very difficult on-the-ground factual determinations that law enforcement would need to make before deciding whether someone could be given a citation for camping outdoors.\n\nWhy wouldn't it make more sense, assuming that we agree in substance with the line that Robinson would control here, why wouldn't it make more sense for the Eighth Amendment claim to be raised as a defense, much like the necessity defense, once a court is in the position, unlike the law enforcement officer just trying to gather information on the ground, to determine whether there were available beds, whether the person had a place to go?\n\nWhy is a pre-enforcement challenge the right way to think about this?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, several things. It -- it obviously could be raised as a defense in a -- in a criminal prosecution or civil -- citation --\n\nJudge: Sure.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "881", "dialogue": "Judge: This may be a frolic and a detour, but have there been real cases in which the United States has criminally prosecuted itself?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I am not aware of any.\n\nJudge: I mean, if such a case came here, what would—it's Monday morning.\n(Laughter.)\nI'm having trouble getting a grasp on this. How would this work? You would be arguing on one side, and one of your colleagues would be on the other side, and you'd be arguing against each other?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right. I mean, it's a pretty incongruous idea. We think that if Congress wanted that result, it would have made it much clearer than just using the word \"person.\"\n\nAgain, though, the reason that it matters why Congress uses just \"person\" or instead addresses the sovereign in the cause of action itself is that when Congress uses references to the sovereign itself in the cause of action, the only purpose those words can serve is to authorize recovery against the sovereign.\n\nAnd so, in Financial Oversight and Management Board, the Court said that when Congress has expressly authorized suits in that way, it would effectively negate the statutory language to allow the assertion of a sovereign immunity defense. And in that circumstance, the Court has been willing to infer that Congress must have intended to waive sovereign immunity.\n\nJudge: Well, it does negate the statutory language if you do the normal thing that we do in interpreting statutes, which is plug in the definition into the provision that uses the defined term.\n\nSo, here, plug in the definition to n and o, and then it negates the statutory language in the same way that it does in all those other cases.\n\nSo I've said that before. Here's what I really want to ask: What does \"person\" mean if it doesn't mean that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we think that, just as we think in 1681q it means its ordinary definition, so too in n and o, we think it carries its ordinary—\n\nJudge: What is its ordinary definition? Does it include individuals?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It includes individuals.\n\nJudge: Does it include partnerships?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It includes partnerships.\n\nJudge: Corporations?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Trusts?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Estates?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Cooperatives?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Associations?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Other entities?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, but not governments.\n\nJudge: Just not government. I mean, that's a strange way to read a defined term, right? We'll take every part of the defined term and plug it in but not plug in this last listed thing before you get to the residual term.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So that's what we think Congress did in 1681q, and we think it's plausible to think that it did the same thing in 1681n and o.\n\nBut, to the point you made before that, I mean, yes, if we—\n\nJudge: Well, how about the point I'm making now?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That is my answer, that we think that it carries a meaning other than its defined one, just as \"air pollutant\" in Utility Air carried a meaning other than its defined one, just as \"person\" in 1681q carries a meaning other than its defined one.\n\nJudge: But we're taking the entire definition, except we're striking \"government.\" We're taking the entire definition, except for one word, two words, \"governmental subdivision or government,\" four words.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, because that is the ordinary meaning of \"person.\" It is—\n\nJudge: Okay. But—\n\nJudge: Why—why are you doing that? I mean, why—put aside the ordinary meaning of \"person.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We're doing that because we think it's plausible to read the civil liability provisions in the same way that it would be plausible to read the criminal liability provisions.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought you were doing that because of sovereign immunity, and it's important to protect the fisc of the United States against ambiguous derogations of sovereign immunity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we're also doing it for that reason. We think that that's where the—\n\nJudge: But Congress can waive sovereign immunity, and the question is whether Congress has done so.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. And nothing in the statute—may I finish?\n\nJudge: Sure.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Nothing in the statute says anything about sovereign immunity. You can only do that from implication. And we think, logically, the fact that Congress didn't specify sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself means that implication is not available here.\n\nJudge: We'll afford you a couple of minutes for rebuttal.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "119", "dialogue": "Judge: There are distinctions with --with the -- the subject matter jurisdiction inquiry. The court is generally deciding it at the beginning, and the judge is doing it without a jury. It is the rare circumstance where the judge --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: And we said in this case, when the fact is intertwined, you had to --\r\n\r\nJudge: When it's intertwined, this Court still has expressed that the district court has discretion to decide that but suggests that when they 're -- it's dependent, that it should go to a jury. There's no barrier at that point in terms of this Court's jurisdiction to sending it to a jury.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff: Thank you.\r\n\r\nJudge: That's not true with exhaustion. Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nJudge: Ms. McGill.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I just wanted to begin with two clarifying points. This is the first time in this five years of litigation that the State has represented that the --all of the claims might be able to be exhausted. The First Amendment claim that was the subject of the Sixth Circuit's decision here, as far as we can tell, is not protected by the PREA policy. And the Sixth Circuit held that exhaustion and the merits here were completely coterminous under Sixth Circuit First Amendment law.\r\n\r\nThe State also agrees that the historical facts at issue here are of the type that juries decide, and I think that makes this an easy case on the actual question presented because, whatever else is true, this is a 1983 action for money damages. So the jury must resolve those facts regardless of how you characterize exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThat is the point of Beacon Theatres, which is just a specific application of the general rule that even truly threshold issues must be deferred to the jury when they're intertwined with the merits. It's no answer to say that the facts could be relitigated in front of a jury maybe if and only if the case proceeds. It's simply not good enough that the jury trial right might sometimes be preserved.\r\n\r\nAnd the State's suggestion that judicial findings would not be binding on a future hypothetical fact-finder really gives the game away. The only reason that would be so is because of the Seventh Amendment. That was this Court's unanimous holding in Lytle.\r\n\r\nAnd there's certainly nothing in the statute or the federal rules that would suggest the non-binding factual findings procedure that the State suggests here. The State warns that having jury trials on exhaustion will undermine the goals of the PLRA. Those very same arguments were presented and rejected in Jones, and they're even less persuasive here. The State's approach would not reduce the number of trials required. We're talking about the cases that have survived judicial screening and Rule 56, the needles in the haystack as it were.\r\n\r\nRegardless, policy arguments are no match for the Bill of Rights. I welcome the Court's questions.\r\n\r\nJudge: Are you suggesting that the exhaustion --or your exhaustion argument has historical analogs?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: I'm suggesting that this Court held in Del Monte Dunes that a 1983 action at law for damages is an action at law for Seventh Amendment purposes. And I think the State has conceded, and we submit as well, that there is no precise historical analog for the specific theory of the affirmative defense in this case. And I think Del Monte Dunes tells you that when that is so, you look to the functional considerations, the -- the divide between the judge and jury, and, predominantly, factual issues are for the jury as a default rule.\r\n\r\nJudge: Why isn't it enough for you to get the right to a jury after an exhaustion determination if that determination is non-binding?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Two things. I'm not sure why it would be non-binding. But the second is, in this lawsuit, Mr. Richards got past summary judgment on a theory of unavailability under Ross versus Blake and a First Amendment claim that the Sixth Circuit said stated a prima facie case for --for First Amendment retaliation. He got to the point where he should have had a jury decide that. The Seventh Amendment can't turn on whether, after dismissal, a pro se plaintiff might be able to file Lawsuit 2.0 on -- on some of these claims.\r\n\r\nJudge: Well, why not? I mean, it -- it -- if the prior determination without a jury is not binding, what exactly has been taken away? If you can proceed to litigate before a jury with respect to exhaustion, what --what's the great loss? Time, of course, but --\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: Other than five years of --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- but he's got time on his hands, right?\r\n\r\nPlaintiff Lawyer: --of effort. It's no small feat for a litigant like Mr. Richards, who was representing himself throughout these proceedings until the Sixth Circuit appointed counsel, to even get a case filed and before a court and all the way past summary judgment. So I think that's a significant consideration.\r\n\r\nBut our, you know, second point is that I think, you know, the modern Restatement of Judgments would say that once an issue is finally decided, the words \"without prejudice\" are not magic words that mean that nothing has actually been decided.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think the State would take the position that in this hypothetical Lawsuit 2.0, Mr. Richards could re-argue the very thwarting facts and allegations that were the basis of both the unavailability claim and the First Amendment claim.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

{"id": "787", "dialogue": "Judge: Just two clarifying questions about the limits of your argument. There's a discussion sometimes about permanent appropriations and forever appropriations. My understanding, but I want to make sure you agree, is that Congress could not entrench a funding scheme, in other words, Congress could not pass a law that says this is the funding scheme and no future Congress may alter this for 10 years or a hundred years. That would be constitutionally problematic, is my understanding, and I want to make sure you agree with that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes, I absolutely share that understanding. And I think what it shows is that it's incorrect to characterize standing appropriations as lasting forever. In fact, we've pointed to a number of examples where Congress has acted to change the standing appropriations, and the Customs Service is a great example on this one too. You know, it was funded through a standing appropriation for the first 120 years of this nation's history, and then, in 1912, Congress took it out of a standing appropriation and brought it into annual appropriations. Congress just did this again in the debt limit bill recently. It rescinded many standing appropriations that had been part of the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act, and I think it just demonstrates that there is always that additional check of a future Congress deciding that it wants to alter the work of a prior Congress.\n\nJudge: So Congress could change it tomorrow?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Absolutely, Congress could change it tomorrow.\n\nJudge: Okay. And then, if the statute here gave the Federal Reserve more than ministerial control, that the amount was in the control of the Federal Reserve to range from zero to the cap for what the agency would receive, would that change anything?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think that that would change the relevant constitutional analysis. You might think of that as functioning a little bit like an agency overseeing a sub-agency and making modifications to its budget. In either example, Congress still retains a direct line in deciding how much funding should go to that sub-agency, and if it wants to change anything, there's no kind of double layer of insulation. But even if the Court thought that maybe having that kind of more than ministerial process would create some kind of novel constitutional question, of course, here, it's important to emphasize that the Federal Reserve Board just has this ministerial role and it doesn't exercise any supervision.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Good morning, Counsel. So I'm concerned that there might be burden-shifting happening in the way in which we're thinking about this, and so maybe you can help me just to keep the right burdens in the right place. Some of the questions that have been asked this morning seem to be requiring you to establish whether or not Congress can do certain things—what if Congress, you know, delegated the authority to determine a trillion dollars worth of funding and how the agency was going to do it? What if Congress set it up in this way or that way, et cetera? But I sort of thought that the burden was on them to show that Congress can't set up the agency in this way, and the reason I think that is because of the language of the Appropriations Clause and the way in which it seems to give the legislature the prerogative of the purse.\n\nAnd, here, we have a statute in which the legislature has exercised that. So am I right that that's really all you need to say to win? I mean, you don't lose if you can't establish the limits in Congress's exercise of its authority, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that's right, and I think it actually highlights an important aspect of this case. You know, this is a separation of powers case. We are here defending a statute that Congress provided to fund an executive branch agency. And the plaintiffs are coming in and asking the courts to oversee and superintend Congress's own exercise of its prerogatives over the purse. So I think absolutely the burden is on them to show that that kind of judicial intervention and invalidation of a statute is warranted here.\n\nJudge: And when we get to them, I would assume that in determining what limits there are, they’ve raised certain concerns. They say, oh, it's a problem with duration. Oh, it's a problem that the agency has this degree of discretion, that the agency has this amount of power, that the source is coming from private individuals, et cetera, et cetera. But I guess their burden would have to be to determine that those limits exist somewhere in the law.\n\nI mean, it's not just up to us to sort of say, geez, those things seem problematic. We would have to find a legal source, I would think, in order to agree with them that those limits are actually imposed on Congress's authority.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "70", "dialogue": "Defendant’s Lawyer: Well, the last thing I would point out about Employees before I turn to federal versus state is that a critical part of Employees was that the federal government could still enforce the FLSA against the states. The government's argument here takes us a step further and says no one, not even the federal government or the state governments, can enforce Employees against any governmental furnishers because the term \"person\" does not apply—the definition of \"person\" does not apply to 1681s, which is the administrative enforcement provision. So this would be a step beyond Employees.\n\nOn the federal versus state issue, Congress—I don't think there's a different textual standard in this Court's cases between waiving sovereign immunity and abrogating state immunity. It's simply that what Seminole Tribe and its progeny hold is that where there's a conflict between what Congress wants and what the state wants, the state wins absent—unless it's in a few discrete areas where the Constitution abrogates state sovereign immunity or it's a Fourteenth Amendment case.\n\nBut if this statute were in the Fourteenth Amendment context, I think this language would be sufficient to abrogate state sovereign immunity just as it waives federal sovereign immunity.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I think it's an unavoidable consequence of your interpretation that the statute authorizes criminal prosecution of the United States.\n\nNow, if there were such a prosecution and the United States were convicted, what would the pre-sentencing report look like?\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So, as a technical matter, I would say the proper defendant in an FCRA action would be an agency, not the United States itself. That said, I don't think this Court has squarely held how far the federal—the absence of criminal liability for governmental entities extends. Last year, in Halk Bank, I think you said that criminal law can apply to foreign states and their arms. I don't think you've said that in the context of domestic agencies.\n\nIn Bennett v. Spear, you suggested that perhaps agencies could be criminally or civilly liable for failing to adhere to a biological opinion.\n\nJudge: So you agree that your reading of the statute leads to that result, that a criminal prosecution can be brought against the United States, whether it's through a United States agency or the nation as a whole?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That—that is one reading. I can't say it's absurd since this Court has not said it's absurd previously. That said, the easier path for this Court would be to follow what Judge Katsas said in the D.C. Circuit in the Mowrer decision, what Judge Krause said below, which is that any contextual reason you might have for disregarding an otherwise controlling statutory definition in the criminal context is unique to the criminal context.\n\nJudge: Well, but how—\n\nJudge: Why is that?\n\nJudge: —does that work? I mean, n and o and q are all added at the same time. We can add s to that too because s raises its own anomalies. They're all enacted at the same time. And they're all different kinds of liability provisions.\n\nAnd you're essentially saying—and you're right that Judge Krause said this below, Judge Katsas said it—but you're saying, well, you know, it fits with n and o, so we'll use one interpretation there. It doesn't fit with q, so we'll use a different interpretation there.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So—so one correction. Q stems from the original 1970 act that enacted the definition of \"person.\" The 1996 Act, Congress amended the civil liability provision and amended the administrative enforcement provision to extend—authorize enforcement against persons. But it didn't add in the term \"person\" in 1681q in 1996. That's—\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It enhanced the penalties in the definition. With that said, each—there's no—I think, well, q rests as sort of a stand-alone self-contained provision. It doesn't interact with the rest of the FCRA in any way.\n\nIt contains its own substantive prohibition and its own criminal penalties, whereas you have the liability provisions and the enforcement provisions, which are designed to enforce the substantive—\n\nJudge: But you're—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —provisions of FCRA.\n\nJudge: —to pick up on the Chief Justice's question, it's not just criminal prosecution against the United States, it's punitive damages against the United States, very unusual. State and federal enforcement against the United States would be contemplated if we took your interpretation.\n\nThere's an express waiver in another provision that was enacted months earlier. The government says that's an anomaly. The Privacy Act is a carefully reticulated scheme for imposing liability on the government for Privacy Act violations. They're saying that you would create this anomaly.\n\nSo there's a string of anomalies that the government says would be created by your position.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I think the only one that qualifies as even a debatable anomaly would be 1681q. The government—it just doesn't—I don't think they've made any—\n\nJudge: I thought your—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —case about what—\n\nJudge: —I thought the answer was that it's not that the definition is shrinking or expanding provision by provision, the definition of \"person,\" that you can have this group of entities that are defined statutorily as persons and that carries throughout the whole statute.\n\nBut there may be various provisions in which subsets of persons are carved out because they have other defenses. I mean, just because \"person\" is there doesn't mean that, you know, every person will automatically and always be subject to the entirety of that separate provision.\n\nAs the government said, they could have separate defenses. They could have other reasons why they're not subject to criminal liability even though they're still persons for the purpose of the statute.\n\nSo, if that's happening, then the government's observation that in certain parts of the statute persons are not going to—or governments, even though they're persons, are not going to be subject to that part of the statute, it seems to me, doesn't really help their argument because, as another judge said, we don't see even that happening in n and o, which is really all that is at issue here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right. I think the government argument really tries to focus on provisions away from n and o because there is no textual basis in looking at n and o for not applying the definition as written.\n\nJudge: And there's no real basis for suggesting that—\n\nThat notwithstanding the statute saying that \"persons\" is defined in this way throughout the entirety of the provision, sometimes it's not really defined this way.\n\nIt seems to me that is an implausible reading of the text of the statute that very clearly defines the term and says it applies everywhere.\n\nSo, if it's not actually operative in certain places, it's not because the definition has changed. It's because something else is going on that would prevent that consequence occurring in that particular circumstance.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that's right. For example, in 1681g, subsection g, Congress has an expressed alternative definition of \"person\" for purposes of that provision. That doesn't mean somehow n and o become ambiguous in terms of where the definition applies.\n\nJudge: Well, it's not only—\n\nJudge: —that you think that it's right, but under our sovereign immunity precedent, that has to be the only way of reading it?\n\nIn other words, there's no other way and all these other areas where \"person\" doesn't actually mean \"person\" the way it's defined in the statute but means much less, and there's not just one, there's two, there's three, and you have to say that changing the reading of \"person\" is the only way you could read that because, if it isn't, then sovereign immunity, it seems, is implicit in the statute in a way that other provisions may not be.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I—assuming the hypothetical, which is that there are variations in what \"person\" means throughout the statute—\n\nJudge: It's not my hypothetical, but go ahead.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes. The fact remains, if the Court's going to depart from the otherwise controlling definition, it looks to something else in the statute that provides a countervailing argument.\n\nFor example, in Utility Air, the Court looked to provisions of the statute that said, if we apply the definition of \"air pollutant\" to these provisions, we have an unworkable statute.\n\nAnd to the extent you conclude that \"person\" doesn't apply to 1681q because that's unworkable or improbable that Congress intended to extend criminal liability this far, that is an argument, an interpretation that would be limited to 1681q.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Even in that case, if the manufacturer was simply treating all of the dealers the same, including that dealer, then I don't think you would have crossed the line into aiding-and-abetting liability --\n\nJudge\nTreating them the same, what -- what does that mean?\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nSo, you know, like, say they have a policy that says: You know, look, I sell firearms.\n\nAny dealer that wants to purchase my firearms --\n\nJudge\nI see.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\n-- I'm going to sell them to that dealer.\n\nJudge\nOkay.\n\nWell, they are treating them the same.\n\nI mean, from one perspective, that's -- that's the problem --\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nMm-hmm.\n\nJudge\n-- that they're treating this rogue dealer the same as the good dealers, right --\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nRight.\n\nJudge\n-- even though that they know that the rogue dealer is, in fact, a rogue dealer.\n\nIsn't that enough of a problem to bring you -- and say just where -- one thing that's not -- that is the same is that we're at a 12(b)(6) stage.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nSure.\n\nAnd, Your Honor, I --I -- I think I'd invoke Twitter, where the social media platforms knew to a metaphysical certainty that ISIS was on its platform doing nefarious things, and that knowledge to a metaphysical certainty wasn't enough if you were simply treating your customers all the same and you were indifferent to what they were doing.\n\nI think this case is a lot easier than Twitter in various respects.\n\nJudge\nYeah, I guess that's the question.\n\nIs the -- is the case that I gave you, is it a Twitter or is it a Direct Sales? It seems to me more like a Direct Sales.\n\nI'm a manufacturer.\n\nI have a dealer network.\n\nI know that there's one dealer that's way off the beaten track and doing things that are really different.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nRight.\n\nJudge\nThat seems a Direct Sales case.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nAnd -- and if I can explain why I think that Direct Sales is far more extreme than your hypothetical.\n\nRemember, in Direct Sales, it wasn't just that this doctor was purchasing so much that there was no possible explanation.\n\nThere was no issue -- nobody even argued about whether he was -- the Direct Sales was treating everybody the same.\n\nBut, in addition, what that manufacturer was doing was explicitly encouraging that doctor who it was -- knew -- knew it was already illegal -- illegally prescribing to do it even more.\n\nThere's an example in the facts, for example, where the doctor orders two batches of pills, one for a thousand pills and another for a hundred pills.\n\nAnd Direct Sales comes back and says: Don't do that.\n\nI'm just going to cancel your hundred order because I'll sell you another thousand pills at this massive discount.\n\nSo you not only had a high degree of knowledge, you had a very high degree of conduct with the manufacturer actually encouraging the over-sale.\n\nJudge\nSo you think that's necessary to Direct Sales, that there's a kind of encouragement in addition to a realization that your products are being used in this way for these purposes?\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nYeah, I -- I -- I think that's the necessarily implication of Twitter, where you had knowledge to a metaphysical certainty that one of your customers was doing something bad.\n\nBut what the opinion makes clear is that simple knowledge doesn't get you across the line unless you're, in addition, acting in an unusual way, as the Court put it --\n\nJudge\nHow about if the conduct is like -- and we do this for everybody. Don't get me wrong, we do this for everybody, but it's particularly maybe important to Mexican gang members, is that we make it so that you can, you know, easily scrape off serial numbers and we construct a set of products that are obviously useful in their characteristics for cartel members.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nWell -- well, Your Honor, the more you ratchet up the facts and make them cartel-specific, I think the closer you do get --\n\nJudge\nBecause those --\n\nDefendant Lawyer\n-- to Direct Sales. But --\n\nJudge\n-- those allegations are in this complaint, right, that the manufacturers have basically designed and manufactured a set of weapons with a set of characteristics that are peculiarly useful for criminal activity?\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nWell, and that's where I don't think you would be getting anywhere close.\n\nIf we simply make our firearms in a way that the general public likes and we allow whoever wants to buy our firearms buy our firearms and we know, as in Twitter, that some percentage of them are going to do something wrong, that's not the type of affirmative action that gives rise to aiding-and-abetting liability.\n\nAfter all, the social media platforms in Twitter did know that ISIS was on their platform.\n\nThey were much more active than we are in the ways that I've already described.\n\nThis Court said as a matter of law on a motion to dismiss that that wasn't even close enough because there was no unusual treatment of ISIS relative to any other customer.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nAnd there was no affirmative conduct towards ISIS.\n\nJudge\nJustice Gorsuch? Justice Barrett?\n\nJudge\nJust one question. Is there any reason for us to reach the proximate cause question if we conclude for aiding and abetting that you win?\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nIf you rule for us on aiding and abetting, that will completely dispose of the case.\n\nThe reason to also address proximate cause is because it's an extraordinarily important issue that I think applies in many different contexts, which is why there's such a broad range of amici in this case that go well beyond the firearms industry.\n\nSo, while you could completely resolve it on aiding and abetting, I would -- I would urge you to address proximate cause as well.\n\nJudge\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nJustice Jackson?\n\nJudge\nSo, Mr. Francisco, I'm just trying to understand what you mean by \"resolve it on aiding-and-abetting liability.\" Don't we have to have a conception of aiding-and-abetting liability that is specific to this statute?\n\nDefendant Lawyer\nNo.\n\nJudge\nYou seem to be drawing on others.\n\nAnd I thought we took a statute-by-statute approach to aiding-and-abetting liability.\n\nWe've held as much.\n\nWe've said that before.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "499", "dialogue": "Judge: So, if the parties came to court and made an argument that was specifically directed at the delegation clause somehow being undermined, this would require showing that your argument addresses the same level of concern as who decides.\n\nAgain, if we think about it, you've got who decides, you've got arbitrability, and you have the merits. They pointed to a provision that talks about a court deciding controversies regarding the promotion.\n\nThis threshold question is not a controversy regarding the promotion. And I think that's why, in the district court, in the court of appeals, in this Court, the way respondents seek to get to a delegation invalidation is to argue that the arbitration agreement has been narrowed and there's been some corresponding narrowing of the delegation clause.\n\nJudge: Can we set aside the way they framed it? Because I agree it's a little confusing if you start from the world where we have a delegation agreement, then we have a subsequent agreement, and the question is to what extent the subsequent agreement is a carveout or narrows or whatever.\n\nLet's say we don't frame it that way. Let's say we frame it in the way that I want to think about it, which is: We have contract A that absolutely answers the who decides question, and then we have contract B that implicitly decides the who decides question.\n\nBecause I understood by operation of law, based on what was mentioned earlier, that if you don't pick arbitration, if you're silent about it, then the background rule operating is that arbitration is not what happens, and any question about whether or not arbitration is what happens—the who decides—goes to the court.\n\nSo we have contract number 1 that picks the arbitrator as the one who decides, and we have contract number 2 that implicitly picks the court as the one who decides.\n\nI thought you agreed with me at the beginning that in that situation, it's a question for the court.\n\nAnd that's what we're asking—Which of these contracts is actually operable today?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think the difference between your earlier hypothetical, as I understood it, and this one is that the second contract, in your earlier hypothetical, specifically said that the delegation clause— it identified that there wouldn't be a delegation; it would be on some sort of different terms.\n\nIn this case, the second contract says nothing—\n\nJudge: Right, but—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —about delegation.\n\nJudge: Do you disagree with me that, by operation of law, when a contract says nothing, the court is the one that decides what it means and what happens?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: In the abstract.\n\nIf the only—\n\nJudge: No, not in the abstract. In the way we look at the law.\n\nIf it doesn't say anything about arbitration—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: So if the contract didn't say anything about arbitration—\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —we wouldn't be able to invoke it as part of a motion to compel arbitration.\n\nJudge: No.\n\nWhat you're doing is you're invoking contract 1.\n\nSo—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That's right.\n\nJudge: What I'm saying is, he's invoking contract 2.\n\nWe have two people presenting contracts, one of which suggests that this is supposed to be decided by the court, and the other suggests that this is supposed to be decided by the arbitrator.\n\nAnd so, in that situation, isn't the question which contract controls?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it's important to figure out what the correct starting point is.\n\nAnd I think one of the remaining places of daylight between the respondents and the petitioner here is what the right starting point is.\n\nWe say the right starting point is the arbitration agreement that we seek to enforce.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And here, that is the delegation clause in the first contract.\n\nThat delegation clause, under the straightforward operation of Section 2 of the FAA, remains valid, enforceable, and irrevocable unless they can make some state law challenge that would displace it.\n\nAnd so the question becomes—and this is the analysis the lower court didn’t do—have they, by pointing to the forum selection clause that talks about resolving controversies about the promotion, done anything under state law to displace the who decides delegation clause in the first contract?\n\nJudge: Counsel, can I ask you just a practical question?\n\nI fully appreciate your argument that parties might send to the arbitrator the question of who decides and, at the same time, have the merits decided in one place or the other, even within a single arbitration agreement.\n\nThe arbitrator decides whether agreements go to court or arbitration. Some will; some won’t.\n\nI get that.\n\nI guess I'm a little curious why your client is fighting this so hard if, at the end of the day, you're going to wind up saying, yeah, sweepstakes disputes go to court.\n\nSo, if the arbitrator is going to have to send it to court anyway, why are we here?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: That’s the practical point that I tried to make earlier in response.\n\nI think, if we thought this was going to end up back in court, we wouldn’t have invoked—\n\nJudge: No, I—\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: —the delegation clause.\n\nJudge: I fully appreciate that, and I also appreciate that under Schein, an arbitrator could sanction you for a frivolous effort to keep this in arbitration.\n\nMy question is more practical than that and more detailed.\n\nWhy, in this case, are you fighting it when you have this second agreement that would seem to route the dispute to court?\n\nI accept that maybe the arbitrator should have decided this.\n\nI'm granting you that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "925", "dialogue": "Judge: It is certainly a fair point that the criminal defenders are on the other side.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think they have clearly made a judgment that this rule that the Petitioner and the government are urging is a net benefit for criminal defendants. And I don't think you should take my word over theirs on that. What I think—my submission, though, is that I think it is indisputable that in some cases, like you said, the cases where this is a close question and the government refuses to bifurcate, I think it's going to prejudice defendants. I think that's what the Harrell case that we cite at page 46 shows. In some cases, this is going to prejudice defendants.\n\nJudge: But isn't that true of Apprendi, generally? I mean, Apprendi was not justified on the basis of always helping defendants. There are any number of elements that a particular defendant might prove and might decide in a particular set of circumstances he would rather argue to a judge. I mean, you know, it just doesn't seem to me that that's a reason for denying the force of Apprendi in this situation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, I agree the same could be said of the prejudice point on Apprendi. But this is not something I am making up. This is what courts have said going back hundreds of years—there's a reason to treat recidivism differently. So I think Apprendi recognized a tradition as to present crimes. And Apprendi made that very clear at pages 488 and 496 of the opinion in distinguishing Almendarez-Torres. What the Court said there was Almendarez-Torres was about prior crimes. It was about issues that didn't go to the defendant's guilt. They went to punishment only. This tradition we're recognizing here is about present crimes. The Court recognized it was the prejudice point and the fact this was sort of a collateral issue, more like a sentencing issue. That was why there was a different tradition as to recidivism.\n\nJudge: So your point is it wasn't a historical accident necessarily, it was justified by a principle of not prejudicing defendants?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right. And I think a good place to look for this is the Bishop treatise, one of the leading criminal law treatises of the 19th century, which said just that. He said that recidivism is treated differently because putting it before a jury is seriously prejudicial to defendants and because this is an issue that's more like a sentencing issue which, as noted, has a tradition for hundreds of years as being not subject to the Sixth Amendment.\n\nJudge: On the methodological question, because I think how to think about all this is pretty important here, so start with the text. The text itself of the Constitution does not tell us the answer, just the bare words, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: Okay. So then we usually look to history. We might not like it, but—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Agreed.\n\nJudge: —unless we're just making it up, I don't know where else we're going to look. And the question raised was, who has the burden on that? And I think, I would like you to speak to who has the burden. Do you have the burden to show a consistent uniform practice, or does the other side have the burden to show a consistent, uniform practice going the other way in which recidivism always went to the jury?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that is the critical question. If the government has the burden, then I see no way in which Almendarez-Torres is correctly decided. But I think that in these cases, the government does not have the burden because, as a default principle, when somebody is coming into this Court or a court saying the Constitution invalidates my sentence or invalidates a statute, typically it is upon that person to show that there is some well-established understanding that's what the Constitution means. And sometimes when the text is clear, like in the Gaudin case that was cited, then the burden flips to the government to show some historical practice that contradicts the text. But, as noted, the text here doesn't answer the question. And so we're looking to history. And I would say we're not only just looking—we're not looking to history directly interpreting the connection of the Sixth Amendment. We're looking to history—we're looking to state common law principles. And I think when the Court is that far removed from something actually interpreting the Sixth Amendment, the Court should demand a level of uniformity in those state common law principles before making the leap that the Constitution necessarily incorporated those common law principles.\n\nJudge: Is the right year to look at 1791 or 1868? Obviously, this is a federal case but—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think there's academic debate about that. I think, for purposes of this case, the time of the founding is obviously the most relevant time. And I guess what I would say is I think, if anything, what the history shows here is that there was an almost uniform practice that legislatures had discretion in this area. So it wasn't only the four states where judges were allowed to make findings about recidivism. It was also four states—we have Virginia, Massachusetts, and Maine, significant states, between 1818 and 1824, enacting supplemental information statutes that allowed the government to withhold recidivism allegations from an indictment, despite generally requiring all elements of an offense to be in an indictment. So we have at least eight—and then West Virginia added on a similar statute in 1868. So we have eight states. And then, on the other side, the government and Plaintiff haven't cited a single case in any relevant time period where a court struck down a statute on the ground that it assigned recidivism findings to judges or allowed the government to withhold these allegations from the indictment. And so I think, as far as I can see, there's an unrebutted tradition here of legislatures having discretion when it comes to recidivism. And I think there were good reasons for that, as we discussed.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

I also don't know where that comes from.\n\nIf you start with the regulation, Section 1001.1, it says it applies to any action.\n\nThe government tries to read that in a way that it only applies to regulatory deadlines and not statutory deadlines.\n\nWhat the government fails to grapple with is that many statutory deadlines -- excuse me, many regulatory deadlines simply parrot statutory deadlines in Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in plenty of other regulatory schemes outside of immigration.\n\nWe cite examples at page 42 of our brief where other agencies have adopted this same traditional principle.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I think the question is, what would somebody picking up this statute in 1996 have made of it? That person would have had the immigration regulation we've been talking about.\n\nThey would have been -- they would have had Rule 6(a), which both this Court and the BIA have looked to to understand how deadlines work not only where the rule directly applies but also in other cases.\n\nThat person would have had precedent from this Court applying this traditional rule. That -- that -- that person would have had the common law principle that has applied even before that.\n\nAnd there is nothing cutting in the other direction, nothing that that person would have looked to in 1996 to think that there was a different definition, a different time calculation rule that applied to this statute and this statute only.\n\nWe ask the Court to reverse.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1011", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay. That is what I understood you to be asking from your brief, and I thought you were asking for more in the course of the argument.\n\nJudge: This goes to the earlier questions about what might happen, and this is something that I'll ask the other side as well, but what do you understand the further process to be? Because it doesn't do someone all that much good just to know what the reason was.\n\nJudge: You know, as was mentioned earlier, if you think my husband is John Doe, but he's actually Jack Smith and has no ties to MS-13, the value of that information would be to have some opportunity to be heard about why it's wrong. But the precedent really is just about notice.\n\nJudge: And none of the Court's cases, which are really just a few, have gotten into what would happen after that.\n\nJudge: What is your understanding? Would they have to go back to the State Department? Go back to the consular official? Is the idea that the district court would have some opportunity to hear why this is wrong and why the tattoos didn’t really show an MS-13 affiliation?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They might contemplate that that's what they would be getting because they want the information about what he said or what he did.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We don’t think that’s appropriate.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think that if the Court were to say that -- I -- so I'm not sure what they think is going to happen with respect to that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: They could re-file a new application with the State Department. If they have this information, they will know this was the reason for the first denial.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But that doesn't mean that -- the point of the precedent isn’t actually notice. It’s confirmation that the government had a reason.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And so I'm still fighting the premise that the point is to provide the person who is complaining with some form of redress.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: It’s instead just a confirmation that the government had a legitimate reason to do what it did here.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: There are procedures within the State Department. There were multiple levels of review of this decision.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Anytime that there is a denial, that has to be reviewed by a supervisor. This particular basis for inadmissibility needs to be based on an advisory opinion from Washington, D.C.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And so there are lots of other ways in which the State Department can be asked to go back and approve this decision.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: We don’t think that that should be done at the behest of judicial review and a court saying you have to do this and I want to see all of your evidence.\n\nJudge: Okay. So the government’s position is that even if the precedent applies, once you point to a reason, whatever is required to make that reason sufficient, that would be kind of the end of it anyway?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: As was just quoted from the complaint, it would be a declaration that that's not a good enough reason.\n\nJudge: And then you go on your way, and if you want to try to go back --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: If -- if --\n\nJudge: -- to the State Department --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- if they want to re-file, since they’re past the time for reconsideration of this decision, they would have a judicial decision that says that that reason wasn’t good enough on the basis of what was before the agency at the time.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: And it might come out differently the next time.\n\nJudge: But would there be some process in the State Department for letting them make their case that these tattoos, for example, didn’t actually show an affiliation with MS-13, or is it just like you file for reconsideration and the State Department says, okay, well, that wasn’t good enough, but we still think, you know, and maybe just add a little bit more?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I mean, they did provide that information from the State Department.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The officers looked at that information and concluded that it didn’t change their answer here.\n\nJudge: I understand that, and they weren’t satisfied.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: Yeah.

{"id": "842", "dialogue": "Judge:\nYou acknowledge there is some group, though, who later changes their mind and wants to detransition? That doesn't defeat your case.\n\nI just want to make sure you acknowledge there is, as a factual matter, some group of people?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes, yes.\n\nWe're certainly not denying that some people might detransition or regret this care, but all of the available evidence shows that it's a very small number.\n\nJudge:\nThen, to pick up on the Chief Justice and Justice Alito's questions, it's a obviously evolving debate.\n\nI mean, just in the last couple years in Europe, there's big changes in terms of how they're thinking about it and how they're thinking about these risks and benefits that you and I have just been talking about and you've been elaborating.\n\nIf it's evolving like that and changing and England's pulling back and Sweden's pulling back, it strikes me as, you know, a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this Court to come in, the nine of us, and to constitutionalize the whole area when the rest of the world or at least the people who -- the countries that have been at the forefront of this are, you know, pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment because of concerns about the risks.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nWe certainly are not asking the Court to set forth some bright-line constitutional rules in this space that is going to -- to really take further debate and evaluation of regulatory options away from states.\n\nWe think, as I mentioned, that the Court really only needs to decide the first-order question here of whether this law classifies based on sex. I think that's entirely distinct from some of the concerns you've identified about what justifications the State has.\n\nJudge:\nDo you think that West Virginia law you mentioned is constitutional?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nI think it would likely satisfy heightened scrutiny.\n\nIt hasn't been subject to adversarial testing because I don't think anyone has sued to challenge it, so I haven't looked at the record that West Virginia would build, but I do think that there is room here for states to enact tailored measures to try to guard against the kind of risks that you're concerned about and that the State has identified.\n\nJudge:\nAnd last topic, on the heightened review -- and you -- you say all we need to do is do heightened review and that's kind of a minimal approach -- step, I mean, I'm not sure, really, that the follow-on effects of that could be pretty significant.\n\nI think Justice Kagan alluded to that in her question or at least raised that as a question.\n\nAnd I want to ask in particular about one thing.\n\nIf you prevail here on the standard of review, what would that mean for women's and girls' sports in particular? Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women's and girls' sports, basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, et cetera, notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes seen in the amicus brief of the many women athletes in this case? So can you explain how intermediate scrutiny would apply to women's sports?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nYes.\n\nAnd -- and just as a threshold clarifying point, I want to be clear that when it comes to access to sex-separated spaces, like sports and bathrooms, courts already recognize that those are facial sex classifications that trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\nSo it's actually not the question teed up here about how to classify the law in the first place or how to identify whether it's a sex classification.\n\nInstead, that's taken as given in that litigation.\n\nAnd the entire focal point of the disputes in those cases has been, well, does the state have an important governmental interest and does it need to draw the lines to exclude --\n\nJudge:\nIf we -- if we --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- transgender people.\n\nJudge:\nRight.\n\nBut how would it --how would intermediate scrutiny, which we may not -- if we went to intermediate scrutiny, there' s a possibility we would apply it here.\n\nHow would it apply to, in your view -- and maybe you don't have fully informed views, which would be fine -- but how do you think they would -- it would apply to sports?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nSo courts have split on that issue, and I hesitate to -- to try in -- you know, in a vacuum without an actual factual record to try to opine on the State's justification and whether it will satisfy that standard.\n\nIt's obviously a different set of governmental interests that are being asserted there, and those would have to be analyzed in their own right.\n\nBut I think that this Court, if it wants to preserve space to make clear that nothing here should be understood to affect the -- the separate questions that are arising there, the Court could very well do so.\n\nAnd we would have no objection --\n\nJudge:\nDo you think --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\n-- to explicit language saying this decision does not in any way or should not be understood to affect the separate state interests there that have to be evaluated on their own terms.\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nBut looking ahead, do you think it's logically possible as a matter of constitutional decision-making to say that laws like the ones at -- the one at issue here do not satisfy intermediate scrutiny, but laws that restrict women's and girls' sports in a way that transgender athletes cannot participate would satisfy intermediate scrutiny? Is that logically possible?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff:\nOh, yes, definitely.\n\nSo we do think intermediate scrutiny applies in both contexts, but there are a different state of --a different set of state interests at play.\n\nAnd I think one readily apparent difference is that in the context of sports, there are arguments made that that affects the rights of cisgender women and that the ability to allow transgender women to compete on those teams is going to be other regarding in the sense of having those external impacts.\n\nThere's nothing like this here. Allowing transgender individuals who have carefully thought about this and consulted with their parents and their medical team to access these medications that have health benefits recognized here and abroad in no way affects the rights of other people.\n\nAnd so I think the Court could well understand the statute here to fail intermediate scrutiny even if it would survive there.\n\nJudge:\nThank you.\n\nJudge:\nJustice Barrett?\n\nJudge:\nGood morning, General.\n\nI want to pick up on one of Justice Kavanaugh's early questions.\n\nYou know, he -- he pointed out that the burdens of the law fall equally on boys and girls because neither can transition.\n\nAnd you responded that it's kind of the -- the sex classification or the expectation that one will conform to one's, you know, biological or gender assigned at birth.\n\nWhy isn't that more of an Arlington Heights argument about intentional discrimination than if what you're really saying or what the legislature is really saying is the burden of this is going to be equally applicable, neither boys nor girls can have access to these drugs, but the reason why is because we want girls to be girls and boys to be boys at least until they're old enough to decide otherwise?", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "940", "dialogue": "JUDGE: So can I ask about the dimensions of your argument in two different ways? I'll give you just a couple of hypotheticals.\n\nSo one is suppose we take this out of the employment context.\n\nWe're not talking about a benefit of any kind.\n\nIs that perfectly okay? Or does that change matters?\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: I think, Your Honor, if we're talking about case by case, then I think it's time to affirm the Alabama Supreme Court's decision because it was just this categorical argument.\n\nBut, second, to get to your question, you need to look to see does this look like a rule of judicial administration or not.\n\nIt may be looking a lot more like Felder and thus might be more suspect, but --\n\nJUDGE: I --I don't understand.\n\nWhat makes it more suspect?\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Well, it --it might be what are --like, who is it that's doing the adjudication? What are the sort of requirements that bind them?\n\nJUDGE: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of set up the same way, but there, it's a police board.\n\nYou know, police officers are on these boards, and they make you go through three -- three different stages, and we make you do all that for police boards of different levels before you can take the claim to court.\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Your Honor, again, if it's particularly stringent, you might run into some problems like in the Brown case from 1949.\n\nIf it looks like it's designed to minimize liability, you might run into some Felder problems.\n\nJUDGE: Well, if, if, if. Let's just say it's the same kind of thing, but it's in the police context.\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Your Honor --\n\nJUDGE: It's the same time limits.\n\nIt's the same everything.\n\nThere's no piece of paper that says we're doing this to prevent good claims.\n\nYou know, it's -- but -- but it's in a -- it's in a different context, a non-benefits context, a quintessential 1983 context.\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: The Court has said in Howlett and Haywood that neutral rules of judicial administration are a valid excuse for refusing to entertain a federal claim.\n\nSo, if that is a valid and -- and jurisdictional rule that's been set up, then I think that would be okay.\n\nJUDGE: Well, why wouldn't --\n\nJUDGE: -- that look an awful lot like Haywood itself, a -- a rule that evinces hostility to the 1983 claim? Because there's no tradition of requiring this sort of thing when a plaintiff wants to sue -- wants to bring a classic Fourth Amendment 1983 claim.\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Well, I think that history could factor in.\n\nBut, at the same time, in Haywood, there was no way to get into state court whatsoever.\n\nI took it in Your Honor's hypothetical that you -- you would get to court eventually to raise your claim.\n\nAnd so -- and this Court has said -- I think this Court's rulings show that merely deferring consideration of a claim is very different than defeating it.\n\nSo look at Johnson v. Fankell, where you had a 1983 defense of qualified immunity that was denied at summary judgment stage in the Idaho trial court, and they wanted to take that up immediately to the Idaho Supreme Court and were not able to do so.\n\n1983 did not give them some right of interlocutory appeal.\n\nAnd I think that's essentially what Petitioners are asking for here, is a right of interlocutory appeal.\n\nJUDGE: Well, I -- I don't want to derail -- Your Honor, I think, had a number of hypotheticals, but --so I -- I don't want to interrupt that.\n\nBut then, eventually, I do want to ask you about the Plaintiff’s Lawyer’s narrow argument.\n\nDid you want to --\n\nJUDGE: It -- it doesn't matter which way we do it.\n\nJUDGE: Okay.\n\nI'm not sure I can capture exactly what his narrow argument is. But suppose the narrow argument is that there's no exhaustion requirement in a 1983 case in state court, where it is, as a practical matter, impossible or extraordinarily onerous to get a decision.\n\nHow would the state be hurt by that? What would be wrong with that?\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: I think there might still be some -- some sovereignty interest if you're going to be reading the statute to require state courts to exercise jurisdiction that the state has never given them jurisdiction to exercise.\n\nAnd that's why the Court has been careful in -- even in Haywood to say that these neutral and -- and truly jurisdictional rules are a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction.\n\nThat's the nature of any jurisdictional rule.\n\nThat's going to keep some cases out of court, so that can't be the test.\n\nJUDGE: But it --it -- couldn't it be, though, that in some of those cases at least, where it's truly impossible and it really is a Catch 22, that that is evincing hostility to the plaintiffs' claims and a Felder argument might be made there?\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Absolutely.\n\nOr even a Haywood argument.\n\nJUDGE: Or even a Haywood argument.\n\nI mean, you -- we just don't know whether that's the case here.\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Right.\n\nJUDGE: Yeah.\n\nAll right.\n\nJUDGE: How about if -- you know, in Felder, there is a lot of talk about the time limits.\n\nHere, the time limits are even more stringent than they were in Felder.\n\nSuppose we make them even more stringent still, and let's add another bunch of things.\n\nLet's say that instead of three levels of review, there are five levels of review. Let's say between each level you have to proceed within five days, and then you have to bring your court claim at the very end within five days.\n\nLet's say we have empirical evidence that suggests that because the state administrative process is very slow, it takes an average of 10 years to actually get to court.\n\nAt that point, can we say that this is so -- so onerous a process that it has to be in conflict with 1983?\n\nLAWYER OF DEFENDANT: Your Honor, that sounds like it -- it could fall under Haywood and -- and potentially be in conflict with 1983 under a Haywood theory.\n\nEven if it is a truly jurisdictional rule, that starts to look like an evasion rather than something that's really about the competence over the subject matter.\n\nBut, here, this truly is about competence over the subject matter.\n\nYou have an expert agency -- like, since these claims existed for the first time in 1935, they've always been adjudicated in the first instance by these hearing officers.\n\nThey have expertise when it comes to hearing these types of claims because they hear thousands or hundreds of thousands a year.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "878", "dialogue": "Judge: Can I go back to the previous question and ask for a point of clarification? I understood Texas law to provide a cause of action for vitiating the federal Fifth Amendment right. I took your answer to be saying that Texas courts define a taking for purposes of the Texas Constitution. Am I wrong in thinking that Texas allows you to bring a state cause of action for the federal Fifth Amendment claim?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I'm not sure whether that's right, to be honest. And I think two things flow from this. One, if it's true that there is a Texas common law cause of action under which we could vindicate our Fifth Amendment rights, then the Fifth Circuit still has to be reversed because it held that the substantive claim should be dismissed on the merits.\n\nJudge: Okay. Let me just clarify this procedural point. Does Texas provide a state cause of action to vitiate the state takings right from the Texas Constitution?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. Then it seems that Texas can't discriminate against the federal claim anyway.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that's true, but Texas isn't trying to discriminate against this federal claim. What Texas says, like other state courts, is that it doesn’t create a cause of action through common law analysis. Instead, it conducts constitutional analysis. Texas courts cite the Fifth Amendment and recognize it as creating an obligation. Frequently, they reference prior cases that confirm this obligation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: As I understand Texas's argument, the complaint we filed in state court was valid and could have been adjudicated under the Fifth Amendment. But once it was removed, Texas moved to dismiss and sought an interlocutory appeal, which extinguished that claim. My concern is that if Texas's argument is adopted, it will send a message to state courts that the Fifth Amendment does not require a remedy, eliminating the federal takings remedy in state courts across the country.\n\nJudge: The language of the Takings Clause is quite similar to the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment, which immediately precedes it. \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\" Why should they be read differently with respect to the creation of a cause of action?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I don't think they have to be read differently. If there's an ongoing due process violation, a plaintiff could bring an action similar to Ex parte Young.\n\nJudge: Not an Ex parte Young action, but a claim for damages?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, I think that’s the difference here. We're not seeking damages; we're seeking just compensation. We're not saying there was a past completed violation of the Constitution that needs to be offset. We're saying that the government has taken property, which creates a present duty to pay just compensation, and we want that obligation enforced. The alternative view, that only injunctions are available, does not align with either the text of the Fifth Amendment or historical interpretations.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: For example, early legal commentators discussed the Takings Clause in terms of the military seizing property. The understanding was not that you could stop the government from taking property, but rather that there was an ongoing duty to provide compensation. Historical court decisions, such as those from the Massachusetts Supreme Court, reflect this understanding as well.\n\nJudge: If the Fifth Amendment confers a right to sue for just compensation in and of itself, is that right unqualified? If not, what qualifications do you recognize?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I certainly don't think it's unqualified.\n\nJudge: What qualifications do you recognize?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It requires a court of competent jurisdiction. Congress is free to channel jurisdiction as it sees fit, and Texas is similarly free to establish jurisdiction through its courts. But the core argument is that there is an underlying entitlement to just compensation, and when that entitlement is denied, a court of competent jurisdiction can order that compensation be paid.\n\nJudge: Does it make sense to view the Fifth Amendment as providing a right to sue for compensation, but your ability to vindicate that right depends entirely on Congress's discretionary choice to create lower federal courts and grant them jurisdiction? That sounds like a very weak right if it is subject to such limitations.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The same could be said of the entire Bill of Rights. All federal constitutional rights depend on Congress to create lower federal courts where these rights can be vindicated.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1021", "dialogue": "Judge: So just one question. The Chief mentioned the sort of common intuition that everybody gets their day in court. And I understand that and agree in a general sense. But there's also the intuition that the Court sometimes talks about—the importance of finality. And it seems to me that in this particular scenario, finality principles should be playing a significant role.\n\nSo can you just speak to—this has come up a couple of times—but why should a new company that has been born into a particular regulatory environment be entitled to appear on the scene and potentially unsettle all of the long-established rules and expectations that govern all of the other companies that exist in that space?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, of course, we don't think they should. And I think—any statute of limitations is always balancing the interest in judicial review, on the one hand, and the interest in repose, on the other.\n\nAnd I think in the context of administrative law challenges to agency action, both of those considerations sort of point in the direction of accrual at the time of agency action because the new entrant to the market knows what it's getting into. So its interest in having its day in court is less than it might be in some other contexts.\n\nAnd on the other hand, because there are so many new entrants every day in a market, if you don't cut off the limitations period at that point, then the time for bringing challenges would extend to decades.

{"id": "868", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay, yeah, Congress doesn't share it, but, I mean, it has -- it's not exactly an uninterested party. It has set up an agency, and they just as soon not -- it not be challenged. We don't say when there's a legal challenge to something else that Congress is happy with it, so go home.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I don't think there's any dispute that Congress can say that facial challenges are not available after a certain point. My friend is not here suggesting that the Hobbs Act or the dozens of other special statutory review provisions that we've pointed to are unconstitutional. And there are in the APA -- APA context other ways in which parties can raise challenges to agency action, and --\n\nJudge: Like what?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: Like what one is going to help Corner Post? I mean, they're not injured by direct enforcement of the regulation, so don't tell me, well, they can object to enforcement. What else is there?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So the other option is that they can petition for rulemaking. That's something that Congress set out in Section 553(e) of the APA itself. In 555(e), it required the agency to respond in a reasonable time. My friend --\n\nJudge: Well, but -- but maybe they don't want a rule. They want the government to stop what it's doing to them.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I mean, we were -- we were talking in this case about Corner Post's interests. I think it's relevant that Corner Post is not relevant or, excuse me, is not regulated. And so it's true that Corner Post can't assert these types of claims in an enforcement action, but that's because this rule doesn't apply to Corner Post.\n\nJudge: But you don't doubt that it has standing, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, we don't doubt that it has standing. And so it could have brought a suit within six years after the regulation was adopted, just as --\n\nJudge: Well, but they weren't -- they weren't in existence six years after the regulation was adopted.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So that's true. It's also true in the Hobbs Act context, it's true in dozens of other contexts as well --\n\nJudge: We have a whole bunch of things that are illegal.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I -- I don't think anyone has suggested that those are illegal, I mean --\n\nJudge: Well, I --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- except for the Chief Justice of the United States. (Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So --\n\nJudge: Thanks.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- with -- with that caveat, let me put it this way. I don't think the -- the entity with the strongest interest in making that kind of argument has made any serious suggestion that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional or that those other special statutory review provisions are unconstitutional. So I think --\n\nJudge: I didn't mean to suggest it either, but you do have a specific injury inflicted by the government, the individual has standing, and your argument is, well, Congress doesn't want people to sue, or somebody else had the chance to sue and you could have joined that trade association.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I do want to push back a little bit on the idea that this injury is inflicted by the government. I think the reason that they cannot assert this claim in an enforcement proceeding is because the government is not applying this regulation to them directly. What their argument is, is that the government should be regulating someone else more aggressively. And so, in that context, it's true that they have fewer rights to judicial process when what they want is for the government to go and regulate someone else. If they were the one regulated, they would have additional rights, and that's true in the context of dozens of other special statutory regime questions as well.\n\nJudge: But, counsel, I mean, you mention the enforcement action possibility, but why would banks challenge this rule? They benefit from it. So that avenue doesn't seem to be very helpful to you.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, I mean, I think the banks probably think the rule should be higher, but --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But I do want --\n\nJudge: Right. If anything, they want more money.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I do want to get to my friend's suggestion that the Board has been unresponsive to petitions for rulemaking.\n\nJudge: Well, no, that -- that -- that wasn't my question. And -- and -- and just to pick up on the earlier point, I can certainly understand Congress might want to pass statutes of repose with respect to rulemaking in a variety of contexts, as it did before the APA and it did after the APA with respect to specific statutory schemes. But the APA was passed 80 years ago as the background rule, the kind of minimum, the floor, and it was with a presumption of judicial review. And it uses the word \"accrue,\" which had a lot of encrusted meaning, and we have a lot of precedent about it that suggests, yes, an injury, that's when it starts, okay? Why wouldn't -- and just as a matter of sense -- your whole argument is it doesn't make sense to interpret it differently than those agency-specific statutes, the Hobbs Act and others. But -- but is that so? Why wouldn't it be also perfectly rational for Congress to have adopted as the background rule the norm, the traditional common law rule?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I disagree that that's the traditional rule in this context. Both before and after the adoption of the APA and --\n\nJudge: I'm talking about the word \"accrue.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And that's what I'm talking about too. In Reading Company, this Court adopted an interpretation of the word \"accrues\" in which the -- the statute of limitations started to run before the plaintiff could recover on the claim. And then, in Crown Coat Front Company, the Court, pointing back to --\n\nJudge: Certainly, there are statutes where that's done, and, again, I don't dispute that. But the normal rule -- and I think you'd have to concede it -- is that the plaintiff's injury is the moment of accrual, that that's the normal rule.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that is the norm --\n\nJudge: And if we're looking at what the APA was trying to do, as a -- as -- as a floor -- again, I'm not disputing that there are other examples -- but why would it be irrational to think that that's what Congress had in mind? That's my question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So just as a point of clarification, in Reading Company, the statute just used the word \"accrues.\"\n\nJudge: I understand.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

{"id": "334", "dialogue": "Judge: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre. Counsel, you may proceed.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: May it please the Court. Respondent's No Fly List claims are moot. He's not on the list. He hasn't been on the list in eight years. And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently available information. That makes it absolutely clear that his return to the list for the same reasons he was put on it initially can't reasonably be expected to recur.\n\nNow the lower court thought the claims weren't moot because the government hadn't acquiesced to the righteousness of his contentions. That fundamentally confuses mootness with the merits. As this Court has explained, a case can be moot no matter how vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit. Respondent's new test isn't much better because it too can be satisfied solely by repudiation of the past conduct.\n\nAnd that persistent focus on repudiation and the past lays bare what's really going on in this case. The complaint isn't really concerned about Respondent's potentially being put back on the No Fly List in the future. What Respondent wants is vindication for his past placement. But that vindication could come only through an advisory opinion.\n\nThere is no prospective relief of any kind that could actually redress any cognizable injury that Respondent currently suffers or imminently will suffer. Mootness implements Article III's case or controversy requirement. The voluntary cessation exception purpose is rooted in preventing gamesmanship or docket manipulation in an attempt to avoid judicial review.\n\nBut that's clearly not what's going on in this case, and it's not what's going on in other cases either. The government has litigated many No Fly List claims to judgment. This case, however, is 11 years old, and Respondent has been off the list for the past eight of them. There simply isn't a live case or controversy any longer, and this Court should hold as much. I welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Well, the Respondent was also concerned about the propriety of the procedures that were used to put him on the list to begin with and challenged that. So how does the declaration that you all used change the procedures that he thought were violative of his rights?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So two responses. As far as a procedural challenge goes, number one, for the post-deprivation procedures, those have actually already changed since the time he was first on the list. I take the point that maybe he wants some pre-deprivation procedures. Those haven't changed.\n\nBut I think precedent pretty squarely forecloses that challenge. In a similar case, the plaintiffs complained about the procedures used to deprive them of property and the procedures to get their property back. After their property was returned to them, the procedures hadn't changed, but the Court held that the challenge was moot.\n\nAnd I think that just goes back to the fundamental principle behind Article III standing and mootness, which is that you no longer have a live challenge to procedures if, substantively, you're not subjected to those procedures or can't show that it's imminent that you're going to be subjected to those procedures. Procedures in a vacuum just can't be challenged.\n\nJudge: But how would we know, for example, and how would he know that any circumstances or any procedures are different if he's put on the list in the future when we don't know the procedures or the circumstances that got him on the list?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So let me take those two separately. With the procedures, again, I'll just say procedures in a vacuum can't be challenged unless you're substantively going to be subjected to them.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I understand that, but we know nothing. We don't—how would he know a year from now if he is on the list with the same procedures or different procedures or different facts when he doesn’t know why he was on the list in the first instance?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So that's the key. He does know why he was on the list, and we've made this public. The standard to be on the No Fly List, in addition to reasonable suspicion that someone is a known or suspected terrorist, is that they must also pose a threat of conducting or engaging in one of four enumerated acts of terrorism—international terrorism, domestic terrorism, or a violent act of terrorism.\n\nHe was told that he was put on the list because he posed a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and was operationally capable of doing so. Now, I appreciate the fact that the information on which that determination was based is classified and that we don't reveal that for obvious reasons. It's based on a totality of information at the time the decision is made.\n\nBut that is the threshold determination—only people who satisfy that are placed on the list, and so we know exactly what those criteria are.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "879", "dialogue": "Judge:\nAs the Court may be aware, there are other cases pending about the validity of the Universal Service Fund structure, precisely under doctrines like non-delegation, that go to some of the concerns you're raising. But I don't think those are False Claims Act concerns.\n\nWhat the False Claims Act is concerned with is protecting the integrity of government programs, as Justice Jackson pointed out, and ensuring that program funds move to their intended beneficiaries, which are identified by the government, and the amounts they're supposed to get come from the government as well.\n\nAnd so I think, if you have concerns about how the program is structured, those are really concerns for another case, not this one, because they don't bear on whether the Universal Service Administrative Company is an agent of the United States, nor whether the funds are provided by the government.\n\nAnd I would just say one more thing which may help with the concern you're drawing, is that the Universal Service Administrative Company, the administrator here, is not like just any private entity.\n\nYou know, it's not as if private carriers are being ordered to pay funds to just another private company that's out there.\n\nThis company has one job.\n\nIts only job is to administer this government program or this set of Universal Service government programs.\n\nIt has no real other function, and I think that really does distinguish this situation from things the other side talks about, like minimum wage or potentially other examples where the government is causing money to move between private parties and we don't normally think of it as providing money.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\nIf -- if we're persuaded by your argument on the hundred million dollars, it seems to me a difficult question whether or not that sort of -- whatever a non-pejorative word for \"taints\" is, in other words, whether that determines the characteristic of the other umpteen billion dollars.\n\nI mean, if -- if it were 10 million, would that be enough to characterize the entire rest of the fund, or $1? Or are you limited with respect to, whether it's damages or whatever, to the percent of money that you actually collect?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThe text of the statute says that if the government provides any portion of the money requested or demanded, then it's covered.\n\nNow, as I say, I think the government provides it all.\n\nWisconsin Bell can't get a penny that the government does not authorize it to get.\n\nAnd so that's our frontline argument, of course.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\nSo -- so just to stop there --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes.\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\n-- your frontline argument is, if it's a dollar, the entire billion-dollar account is government funds?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell -- well, to be clear, our frontline argument is all of the money is government funds.\n\nNow --\n\nPlaintiff Lawyer:\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- coming down to your question, which is about what if only a subset of the money is provided by the government, I think that under the \"any portion\" language, all of the claims are still false claims.\n\nI do acknowledge that there will be damages questions down the line, and to be candid, that is part of why we're saying all of the money is government money.\n\nWe don't want to talk about those questions down the line.\n\nWe want it to be clear because this litigation has been pending for a very long time, and we think resolving it expeditiously is to everybody's benefit.\n\nSo part of the reason we're arguing for all of the money is looking around the corner at the damages questions.\n\nBut, to be clear, in this case, the Petitioner has not made an argument.\n\nThey have not even attempted to make the tracing argument that Justice Gorsuch was alluding to.\n\nThey could have said: Well, if it's only the hundred million, then that's not enough to make us liable.\n\nThey have said nothing of the sort.\n\nAnd so I don't think that question is before you.\n\nI think you can acknowledge, as both parties have, that the \"any portion\" language basically gets us home on liability if you're inclined to go that way, but I really do want to talk through all of the money.\n\nJudge:\nMr. Singh, on -- on the hundred million, just to wrap that up, so there is no traceability argument, so that takes us to the question of damages.\n\nWould a ruling on the hundred million point in your favor cause you any heartburn when it comes to damages and, if so, what would it be?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYes.\n\nWell, Your Honor, I think it will cause the government more heartburn than it causes me specifically, but it will cause a lot of heartburn.\n\nHere's why.\n\nThe hundred million -- if -- if a hundred million were treated as the upper limit on damages and --\n\nJudge:\nWould it be, or -- or would that be relevant at all under the damages provision?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nThe issue has not been briefed in this case or argued.\n\nThe law of damages is --\n\nJudge:\nI suspect you've done a lot of thinking about that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nI have done a bit.

{"id": "1015", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-50, Chiaverini versus the City of Napoleon. Counsel for the plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone in this case now agrees that as the lack of probable cause element of a malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, the charge-specific rule governs. That is, a plaintiff may make out a malicious prosecution claim by proving that one charge is not supported by probable cause, even if other charges are, provided, of course, that the plaintiff also makes out the other elements of the claim. As no one appears to dispute, that charge-specific rule is supported, as Chief Judge Pryor put the point, by both centuries of common law and by bedrock Fourth Amendment principles.\n\nThat's all this Court needs to address to resolve this case. The defense urges this Court to go beyond that ruling to weigh in on a series of open questions about a different element of the Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim, the resulted-in-a-seizure element. No one disputes that the plaintiff must prove that on remand.\n\nBut weighing in on the precise contours of that question would require this Court to go beyond the question presented to address issues not aired at all below, that haven't percolated in the courts of appeal, and to do so on the sort of briefing that doesn't have the kinds of text, history, and common law arguments that you'd expect before weighing in on an element of a constitutional tort. As in Thompson, this case involves a narrow dispute over one element of a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim.\n\nThis Court should simply hold that a plaintiff can make out a claim by showing that at least one charge lacks probable cause, again, assuming they can make out the other elements of the claim, and remand for consideration of everything else. I welcome this Court's questions.\n\nJudge: Well, what do you have to show, if anything, about causation? If you have a situation where you've got three crimes—three allegations—and two are concededly valid and they justify the seizure, you still get relief? Don't you have to show some kind of causation?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. So we agree there has to be some kind of causation. We think the formulation in Thompson is correct. You have to show that the malicious prosecution resulted in a seizure. Our position is that if you want to weigh in on precisely what the counterfactual is, the Eleventh Circuit's position is correct—that the correct counterfactual is, could this have been done as a warrantless arrest? The Eleventh Circuit said—\n\nJudge: What's \"it\"?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Could the plaintiff have been seized for this length of time or seized with this length of time based on a warrantless arrest?\n\nSo the way the Eleventh Circuit articulates it is, look, this legal process was corrupted, we know this legal process was necessary if the detention is longer than 48 hours, right? That's a Fourth Amendment requirement—you've got to have legal process for a detention that's longer than 48 hours. And so, because this legal process was necessary, what you have to show is—you prevail unless this could have been done as a warrantless arrest.\n\nJudge: Well, I thought the evidence was that the first two of the crimes would certainly support what was done in this case without regard to the third.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So that's correct, Your Honor. Would support in the sense that a magistrate could constitutionally have signed this arrest warrant. But, in fact, no magistrate did sign this arrest warrant based on just those two charges.\n\nSo, based on courts' case law, for instance, we cite the Eastern District of Michigan case in our opening brief, where the court says—that's the case, remember, where the attorney general says, \"I can sign warrants to authorize wiretaps.\" This Court says, surely a magistrate would have signed off on these warrants, right? Surely, a magistrate would have caved to the national security concerns and signed these things.\n\nStill a Fourth Amendment violation because a magistrate didn't do so. Again, I think this is all beyond the scope of the question presented. And, frankly, because there are indications from precedent and common law to support the Eleventh Circuit's rule, at the very least, this Court shouldn't go any further than it did in Thompson in defining the precise contours of the resulted-in-a-seizure element.\n\nJudge: Are you giving up on the Solicitor General's position that—as an alternative to the Eleventh Circuit's view—that if you can show that you were retained for longer or that, as you argued below, you would have never been arrested, you would have been given a summons to appear, as the person who sold you the jewelry was, so you would have never been in jail, that that would be enough? Are you giving up on that?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, Your Honor.\n\nSo we think—we don't have much of a dog in this fight. We think that we win under the Eleventh Circuit's rule, we win under the Solicitor General's rule. As between the two, we think the Eleventh Circuit's rule is more consistent with this Court's precedent and with the common law. But, again, we think that you should make that decision on the basis of some briefing about the text of the Fourth Amendment, Founding-era practice, common law—none of which you have before you.\n\nJudge: We shouldn't reach it, is what you're saying?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, that's right.\n\nJudge: Well, what if I think it is subsumed within the question presented? What is wrong with the logic of the Solicitor General's position? Under Thompson, an element of the claim at issue is a seizure, and that's necessary to bring this within the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSo your client was seized when he was arrested, and under Thompson, he experienced a continuing seizure during the period when he was in jail. And so the question is whether either his arrest or the length of his detention was the result of the charge—the so-called money-laundering charge—this statute that doesn’t seem to have anything to do with money laundering.\n\nBut what's wrong with that logic? It seems to follow step by step.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, again, Your Honor, I think we win under that test, right? The police officer's affidavit in this case says we are seeking a warrant because there is a felony of the third degree.\n\nSo I don't want to push too hard on this. That’s a totally acceptable result from our point of view. The reason that we think it's not the best way to interpret that \"resulted in a seizure\" language is twofold.\n\nFirst, what Williams explains is that the entire point of requiring a neutral and detached magistrate to weigh in is to give that neutral party the opportunity to weigh the law enforcement interests against the privacy interests. And so doing this sort of counterfactual predicting what the magistrate would have done kind of undermines that goal.\n\nSo I think the Williams rule, which basically says, look, if you could have done this as a warrantless arrest—right? If you didn't need the warrant, you didn't need to have a Gerstein hearing, and you only detained him for a few hours—then it's fine if the warrant process was totally corrupt. That was just something bonus you were doing.\n\nBut where the warrant was necessary to the detention, you could not have detained him for four days without a warrant, then we're not going to peer in and try to figure out whether the magistrate would have reached the same result if it knew the actual charges.\n\nJudge: What if the other charges on which there was probable cause were also felonies and maybe even more serious felonies than the so-called money-laundering charge? Would you make the same argument?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I don't think we'd be able to make the same argument about why we win under the United States' rule.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "896", "dialogue": "Judge: The whole family, I think, was meant to be covered by the life insurance policy, but I'm not sure why the company's net worth should drop by half. The purpose of the life insurance policy was to prevent that, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that’s what the parties intended, but intent doesn’t govern here.\n\nJudge: I understand, but it seems odd that the company is suddenly worth 50 percent of what it was the day before his death, even though there was a life insurance policy in place to cover the redemption.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right. Two responses to that. First, this is exactly what a redemption is supposed to do—one shareholder receives cash for their shares, and the other maintains control of a smaller company. Second, if your concern is that this isn’t what the parties intended, you’re correct. What they wanted was for Crown to remain a $3.86 million enterprise while providing $3 million to Michael. That results in a $6.86 million valuation for estate tax purposes because Michael owned that value. His percentage stake determines the fair market value of his shares. This aligns with the petitioner's concerns about continuity of ownership.\n\nThere are many ways to ensure continuity in a closely held corporation, but what you can’t do is have $6.86 million in corporate assets, use life insurance proceeds to pay out $3 million to one shareholder, keep the company valued at $3.86 million, and then claim for estate tax purposes that the company wasn’t worth the full $6.86 million.\n\nJudge: What do we—\n\nJudge: Do you—\n\nJudge: Sorry, go ahead.\n\nJudge: Do you dispute the claim that this is a common way for family corporations to maintain continuity of operations? If so, how long has the government overlooked this supposed loophole?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s not our understanding. We know of only three reported cases—Blount and Cartwright from 1999 and 2005, and this case. That’s it.\n\nWe also asked IRS examiners whether they see this often in estate tax returns. They couldn’t find any cases like this. That doesn’t conclusively prove it’s uncommon, but tax advisors likely consider the risks. On one hand, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits ruled in favor of this structure with minimal reasoning. On the other hand, the Tax Court in Blount I explained clearly why this method is problematic: it subtracts the value of the very thing being priced when determining its value.\n\nJudge: So the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits ruled in favor of this?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: That would suggest it is a common way for family corporations to maintain continuity.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Possibly, but this case comes from the Eighth Circuit. It’s likely that tax advisors in the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits felt safer using this method. However, there are alternative structures—like cross-insurance agreements or trusts—that ensure the life insurance proceeds don’t enter the corporation.\n\nThe issue with Blount and Cartwright is that they assume money can enter a corporation without affecting share valuation. There’s no reasoning behind treating the redemption obligation as a liability.\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The assumption is that since the money goes out quickly, it shouldn’t count.\n\nJudge: Exactly.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That may seem intuitive, but it’s incorrect. If the money went to a creditor, it would reduce the corporation’s net worth, and therefore, the shareholders’ value. We agree with that. But here, the money went to Michael’s equity stake—he was cashed out. That’s not a debt owed to creditors; it’s an exchange of shares for cash. This does not reduce the company's net worth.\n\nJudge: If the IRS doesn’t see many cases like this, what do families typically do instead?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The more common approach is a cross-purchase arrangement. In that setup, two brothers would take out life insurance on each other, keeping the proceeds outside the corporation. This allows one brother to buy out the other without affecting the company’s valuation, avoiding the issues we’re discussing here.\n\nJudge: And the reason companies don’t prefer that method is because, in this case, the corporation is paying the premiums?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The two methods are not identical in economic impact. We’re not arguing that this is just a formality. They are structurally different transactions.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

That's the last paragraph of Mandel.\n\nAnd I -- I understand the -- the -- the temptation to say we should decide the easy question here because the government actually did give more information in this case, but that would still leave an entrenched circuit split on the first question presented. Several circuits have said there is no constitutional right in this interest and there's not even Mandel review. Three circuits since Din have assumed the first question and went on to say that the government satisfied the Mandel standard as applied in those cases.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit is the only circuit on the other side that's saying that there's a constitutional liberty interest here. And I do think that assuming that means that we're going to have to continue to litigate questions over what are the contexts in which there's a sufficient liberty interest. Is it a spouse? Is that enough? Is it a fiancé? Is that enough? If a parent and child, is that enough? Does it implicate something other than visa denials? We haven't seen a clean line for distinguishing between the circumstances here and the circumstances there.\n\nBut, if you're in QP-2, my basic answer is that there's not balancing. It's just --\n\nJudge: What do you think is --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- a question of whether it's a facially legitimate and bona fide reason.\n\nJudge: What is required by Mandel in your view, and what would be the problems, from your view, in requiring more of an explanation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, our -- our basic position on the Mandel question here is that the statutory citation is good enough, as Justice Kennedy concluded in Din, and we think that that's similar to what the professors were able to get in Mandel, to the extent that, there, there had to be a reason of some kind because, otherwise, it was just blanket discretion in the attorney general to grant a waiver or not. In this context, there's additional information that is provided by the citation of -- of the statutory kind of inadmissibility.\n\nJudge: And why don't you spell out -- spell out, because I think it's helpful, what would be the problems from the government's perspective if more of an explanation were required than just the statutory citation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, one problem is that in cases that involve law enforcement and intelligence information, as security-based denials like this arise, that there are sensitivities about being able to share that information. That is why Congress has expressly provided in 1182(b) that the State Department doesn't even have to give --\n\nJudge: What --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: -- the statutory citation --\n\nJudge: Explain what sensitivities encompass.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, it encompasses the fact that we'd be sharing information that indicates what we might know about transnational criminal organizations' operations. They would be able to -- in this case, they have said in their red brief that they want not just the statutory citation, which is -- or even the identification of the fact that he was -- we think he was a member of MS-13, they want more than that. They want to know what he said or did that made the government believe that.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So, on page 18 of your brief, in that same paragraph, you talk about the example where, you know, high school seniors generally know the honor code.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mm-hum.\n\nJudge: So this kind of is similar to the hypotheticals brought up earlier.\n\nJudge: What if I said—so that falls outside of your rule because it refers to knowledge? No. Right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It falls what now?\n\nJudge: It falls—that would be inadmissible under 704(b) under your rule.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Right. Okay. But what if you had somebody testify—and let's just say it was an expert, not a fact witness—that yes, the honor code is distributed to all students, we give them time to read it, they sign it at the bottom and then we walk out. What about that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that would be okay.\n\nJudge: That would be okay. And why? So it's just the word \"knowledge,\" is it that formalistic, or once you start stepping back and it takes an inference to get there—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right, it's an inference.\n\nJudge: —it's okay?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In that scenario you're describing, there could still be questions about whether the person who signed the honor code understood the explanation, whether that person remembered the honor code when the alleged transgression happened, et cetera.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But you asked me about how you would articulate the rule. If you wanted to be extra careful, you don't even have to articulate that part of the rule.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Here, you have a statement directly about knowledge. So whatever the line is between knowledge and other statements that might be less direct about the particular mens rea, that would be a different case.\n\nJudge: Well, I think we'd be down the sowing chaos road if we didn't articulate whoever's rule in that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well—well, either way, you're going to have to answer that question.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Pages 28 to 30 of the government's brief, it says that testimony needs to be understood in context and what it signals in so many words.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the government agrees that statements are going to have to be understood in context as to whether or not they're about mens rea.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So we agree with that. We might calibrate that line a little bit differently, and you could give a first cut at it in this opinion, but, again, all you have to say in this opinion—and this goes back to an earlier question—is that the words \"the defendant\" cover not just statements about the defendant, but they cover statements about a class of people that includes the defendant, regardless of whether they're absolute or probabilistic.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Then you're done. You can say that, you know, therefore, we can give some guiding principles to when something is about mens rea or not about mens rea, but you wouldn't even have to do that strictly speaking in this case.\n\nJudge: Thanks.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "960", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, I did want to ask you just about that. I mean, let's say I'm with you on the fact that you can't prohibit being homeless, and because you can't prohibit being homeless, you can't prohibit sleeping outside if you are a genuinely homeless person.\n\nAnd let's say I'm with you that the fact that this ordinance says, well, but we're prohibiting using a blanket, that can't be right. You know, you're not, like, just, like, get hypothermia and the constitutional problem will go away.\n\nBut it does seem as though there are line-drawing issues, as you go up, right? It's a very cold night and somebody wants to make a fire. It's raining and somebody wants to put up a tarp. The city has said you can sleep in particular areas, but it turns out that those areas have a ton of crime.\n\nYou know, you could go on and on. And I'm not -- how do you deal with questions like that? These are not, like, gotcha questions. This is, like, how do you deal with questions like that? Where is the line where the city can say our legitimate municipal interests can come in and say, you know, as to that, as to that, you can't do that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yeah, so what -- and there are several examples that you have there. With respect to tents and tarps, I guess, you -- you were saying, I -- I -- I'd think there's a difference between what you might need to realistically sleep outside if it's raining, snowing, or something like that, and what you might prefer to have as a structure for long-term camping.\n\nAs I mentioned, the city might say you can put up a tent if it's very cold, but you've got to take it down in the morning. That's like being in -- some shelters say you can stay here overnight, but you have to leave during the day and you can come back.\n\nI mean, that might seem gratuitous of the city to do it. It might not want to do it. But -- but we're not saying that the Eighth Amendment would prevent it from doing it, and especially as you say, if there's no alternative and it's, you know, 20 -- 20 degrees.\n\nWith respect to fires, there are really important issues on the other side of that question. In an urban area, if you're creating fires, there may be hazards in a park. There might be --\n\nJudge: So how does --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: -- there might be fireplaces in a park.\n\nJudge: How does a court make these judgments? Because these are tough judgments, and -- and usually they're the kind of judgments that we think of as municipalities making them.\n\nBut you're saying, no, there's a certain level where it's out of their hands and it's in the court's hands. And I guess I want to know what the principle is where those questions go to the courts and why that principle is the right principle.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think -- I mean, I think there are two principles.\n\nOne is that it -- it's the municipality's determination, certainly in the first instance, with a great deal of flexibility how to address the question of homelessness and a time, place, and manner.\n\nAnd then municipalities should -- should be able to choose the place, should be able to choose the attributes of that place, should be able to say we're not going to allow more than, you know, 20 people or something, you know, to -- to regulate it in that manner.\n\nAnd I think the -- I think the principle, the Eighth Amendment principle, would be whether the -- the city has effectively prevented sleeping outside because the protections needed from the elements are not available.\n\nAnd, certainly in Grants Pass, I would think even a blanket would not be enough under some -- but I think that's the -- I think that's the touchstone.\n\nAre you basically -- does it boil down to or is the core principle that you can't criminalize homelessness, which includes not being able to criminalize sleeping outside?\n\nIf you can't sleep outside because of lack of protection from the elements, I think that's the principle a court would apply. But the Ninth Circuit, in a number of cases, has gone way beyond that.\n\nAnd we think that's really the source of the problems that have been identified in the briefs, and not the core principle.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I want to probe this a little bit further because it does seem to me this status/conduct distinction is very tricky.\n\nAnd I had thought that after previous cases, the ruling was just limited to status. And now you're saying, well, there's some conduct that's effectively equated to status.\n\nBut you're saying involuntary drug use, you can regulate that conduct. That doesn't qualify as status.\n\nYou're saying compulsive alcohol use, you can regulate that conduct in public, public drunkenness, even if it's involuntary. That doesn't qualify as status, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: You're saying you can regulate somebody who is hungry and has no other choice but to steal. You can regulate that conduct, even though it's a basic human necessity. And that doesn't come under the status side of the line, right?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Okay. But when it comes to homelessness, which is a terribly difficult problem, you're saying that's different and -- because there are no beds available for them to go to in Grants Pass.\n\nWhat about someone who has a mental health problem that prohibits them -- they cannot sleep in -- in a shelter. Are they allowed to sleep outside or not? Is that status or conduct that's regulable?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I think the -- the question would be whether that shelter is available.\n\nJudge: It's available.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, no, available to the individual?\n\nJudge: It's available to the individual.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: It's just because of their mental health problem, they cannot do it.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I think there might be -- I mean, that's, the mental health problem --\n\nJudge: Status or conduct?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: The mental health situation itself is a status.\n\nJudge: Right, I know that.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: But -- but it --\n\nJudge: It has this further knock-on effect on conduct. Is that regulable by the state or not?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I --\n\nJudge: All the -- you know, alcohol, drug use --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right, right.\n\nJudge: -- that they have problems too, but you're saying that conduct is regulable. How about with respect to this pervasive problem of persons with mental health problems?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I think in a particular situation, if the -- if the -- if the person would engage in violent conduct as --\n\nJudge: No, no, no, don't mess with my hypothetical, counsel.\n(Laughter.)\n\nJudge: I like my hypothetical. I know you don't. It's a hard one, and that's why I'm asking it. I'm just trying to understand --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I -- I --\n\nJudge: -- the limits of your line.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I think it would depend on how serious the offense was on the -- on the -- individual.\n\nJudge: It's a very serious effect. The mental health problem is serious, but there are beds available.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: What I was trying to say it would depend on how serious being required to go into that facility was on the person's mental -- if it would make his mental health situation a lot worse, then that may not be something that's --\n\nJudge: So that's status -- that falls on the status side?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, I -- I guess you could put it that way, but I -- I guess what I'm saying --\n\nJudge: I -- that's what I'm wondering. I don't -- I'm asking you.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well --\n\nJudge: I really am just trying to figure out --\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: You could view that as --\n\nJudge: You're asking us to extend previous rulings. I'm asking how far?\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Well, what I was going to say, you could -- you could think of it as status, but I think another way to think about it is that place realistically available to that person?\n\nJudge: It is in the sense that the bed is available.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: I know that it's --\n\nJudge: -- but not because of their personal circumstances.\n\nDefendant’s Lawyer: Right.

{"id": "67", "dialogue": "Judge: If it's right next door, that's close -- that's close in distance. Maybe it would take a while to build the project.\n\nAnd so that's a matter of the agency's judgment, is: But what should be taken into account?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: But that's not remote in time and place, right? I mean, that's -- that's close in place.\n\nSo is that --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nNo, I was -- I was responding to the point that sometimes an agency should take account of something that isn't directly -- it's not just the place, it's not just the ski lifts.\n\nIt's --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I agree.\n\nI agree.\n\nIt just seems like that's not -- I mean, so I think, like, the 88 miles, just focusing on the track itself, might be too narrow a focus. But, if it's something kind of alongside either in your hypothetical, it's something that seems to me pretty close in space.\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nNo, and that -- that -- that was my point about indirect effects.\n\nSome -- it -- it's not the ski resort -- it's not the ski lifts itself. It's -- it's what -- what indirect consequences that will have by building the ski resort there or maybe a mile away.\n\nSo it's a question --\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nI guess what the Lawyer of Defendant is saying is, you know, it depends how you define the term \"remote.\" But I wouldn't think of that as remote.\n\nSo I would think of that as passing Mr. Clement's test. Is there -- is there anything that you're worried about that's not, like, just around there but really is further away, that the agency should really take a look at because it could influence their decision-making?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, I -- I think the Corps of Engineers, in issuing a permit for a deposit, is not just going to look at -- or shouldn't just look at the immediate place where there might be fill put in the river but -- but should be concerned if the -- if whatever pollutant is being added, what -- what's its effect downstream going to be.\n\nIs it -- is it poisonous? Would it affect drinking water downstream?\n\nJudge: That goes to the issue of the nature of what the impact is, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJudge: And some impacts can be more localized, and some impacts might not be.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nJudge: A smokestack might be blown because of the winds in a particular area to five states.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nJudge: In another, it might be blown to two.\n\nAnd the same thing -- you just mentioned that if it's affecting the water, you can't just look at the little pond that's there; you have to look at where it travels when it leaves the pond, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nJudge: And it could go a very far distance in some situations, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nJudge: You can have downhill motion that could take something miles away.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: So that's why a test that just speaks about the local impact is not enough if that's all you're saying.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Right.\n\nNo, I think that's right.\n\nAnd -- and Mr. Clement was concerned about context-specific analysis.\n\nTo some extent, that's inevitable, but I mean -- what I think we mean by context-specific is looking at the statute that the agency's acting on, what -- what is it supposed to be focusing on, and enabling the agency to focus on that and the particular decision that is being made. Sometimes that focus will be informed by the fact that another agency is also going to look at this.\n\nAnother agency will be concerned about the downstream effects.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. You obviously focused on a lot more -- I don't know whether they were adjectives or nouns, but particularly in your opening, to determine what exactly is available here, and then I think a lot of the questions were pressing along the same direction. In light of all that, I think the most important question is going to be whether or not the agency will entertain motions for extension of the 150-page limit. (Laughter.)\n\nJudge: How in the world -- how in the world -- putting aside whether -- the question for the people who have to -- and the agencies who have to fill this in, how in the world is somebody going to know how they should use a very, very limited, in terms of government work, page limit and -- and -- and, at each turn, knowing that failure to address a particular item could result in -- in the project being either delayed or -- or denied? And -- and yet then -- and you sort of gave yourself this safety valve: Well, in this case, it's very clear, and in this case, that. But, in other cases, you've left a lot of uncertainty both for the agency and the people appearing before it.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, two responses to that, and there may be more. The first is that the page limit, I -- I think, should be a statutory affirmation that the agency shouldn't have to go to the ends of the earth to focus -- or to decide the environmental issue.\n\nIt should focus on what are the -- what are the core concerns, identifying what the core concerns are so that the agency will have that in mind, and then decide how deeply it needs to go into that.\n\nSo I think -- I think enabling -- as this Court's decisions have sought to do, enabling the agency to focus closely on what it regards as most material to its decision. The second point is -- is the other, I think, problem that comes up in judicial review is the fly-specking, which really isn't present here but is more present in the other aspect of this case in terms of downline effects, where the track is going through another state. Courts review these very intensely and said, oh, you should have done another study or you've got -- you've got this problem over here that you could have talked about more. And I think -- and it's not really present in this case, but I think -- I think the courts need to be reminded -- and, again, this comes in with the reasonableness review and Vermont Yankee and arbitrary and capricious -- need to be reminded that the agency gets to decide in the first instance, with great deference, how deeply it needs to go into something.\n\nAnd if somebody comes in with a -- saying, well, you know, you didn't -- there's another study you could have looked at, at some point, this just has to be cut off, particularly given the page limits and given the -- what NEPA was about was focusing on the things that are most important, which may include, does include, some indirect effects.\n\nJudge: Thank -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: What do you understand to be the issue before us? There were a lot of decisions by the court below, at least five that I'm aware of.\n\nOne was on sending it back for the railroad to consider the additional oil production in the basin and the other that the railroad would spur oil refining in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nAnd your brief was limited to those two issues.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's what we focused on because we didn't understand the question presented to cover the -- the downline effects.\n\nJudge: Neither did I when I read the cert petition. But, having said that, because they don't mention the other things, the -- the -- the wildfires, the railroad accidents, or the Colorado River impact, you don't think those issues are before us?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I -- I -- I don't think -- no, I don't think that they are before you.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "652", "dialogue": "Judge: I have a similar question to the previous one. So—and I don't think it'll require a long answer. Do you agree—so, you know, in the concurrence in the Sixth Circuit, it was stated: Well, listen, Mathews doesn't apply if there is a defined historical practice on point. Do you agree with that, or do you think Mathews would always apply? I understand you think that the history isn't determinative here. And it seems to me like that's kind of the distinction between the different briefs on the history. But, just methodologically, do you agree with this reading of Mathews and precedent about history and procedure?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that if there is a precise answer to the question in the history, then the history would probably govern, but I think we're very far from that.\n\nJudge: Okay.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Very far from that in this case.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: And is it your position that the application of Mathews would necessarily always mean that some additional procedure would be required in a situation like this?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. If the application of Mathews could lead to a conclusion that the state's existing process is sufficient, then no additional process is required.\n\nJudge: Okay. And, you know, I was surprised a little bit, I think, about your answer regarding Von Neumann and why, if at all, remission is different. I had thought that it was not because it was discretionary. I thought it was because the case seems to make clear that it is an administrative alternative to judicial forfeiture under the statute at issue in that case.\n\nAnd so, given that—the owner was complaining about it not happening quickly enough. He chose the option of remission rather than forfeiture, and he wanted the remission hearing to happen quickly. And the court, I thought, in the language that has been quoted, was making a much more narrow point, which is just that remission is not a part of the forfeiture hearing. It's not required by due process. And so, therefore, you don't have a claim that it has to be faster under the Constitution, that, really, forfeiture is where due process lies in terms of your constitutional rights.\n\nBut, to the extent that this language is talking about forfeiture being the only thing, I thought it was relative to the alternative administrative remission process. Am I misreading this?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. And I don't think we're disagreeing. I would simply add the point that this alternative administrative process didn't create any substantive rights because it was discretionary whether the government would give you back your property or not.\n\nJudge: True. But it's also the case, I think from this case, that the court then goes on to talk about how remission is not a part of forfeiture, how those are two different things. And so the language, I thought, was just distinguishing forfeiture from remission as opposed to telling us something about the nature of forfeiture, that it's only the forfeiture hearing and you don't get other steps or whatever, which is the way it's being read, I think, by your counterparts on the other side.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I—I agree. I think that's—that's also a relevant distinction of Von Neumann here.\n\nJudge: All right. Let me finally just ask you about, again, the timing and whether—you know, I think there is something to this notion that Barker is about timing, but, again, the question remains, isn't the claimant in this case making a timing kind of argument?\n\nAnd I guess I see that, but can you help me with the following hypothetical and then maybe I'll also get the reaction on the other side?\n\nSo, if we have a scenario in which everyone agrees that the average time for a forfeiture proceeding is, say, six months after the seizure, and everybody agrees that that is reasonable for due process purposes, Plaintiff Number 1 doesn't receive her forfeiture hearing until 12 months after the seizure, so her claim is that the government was too slow in giving her the hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, Plaintiff Number 2 receives her hearing in six months, but she claims that at some point within those six months there should be an opportunity for the court to consider whether she should have been allowed to keep her car during that interim period.\n\nShe's not complaining about the time. Six months is fine. She got her hearing within the six months. But what she's saying is, while you figure out during that six months who owns this car, I should keep custody of it during that period, and I think we should have that adjudicated separately from the forfeiture hearing.\n\nAre those two different things, or are they both really about timing?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, I think those are two different claims. The first one is claiming I didn't have a fast enough final merits determination. The other one is claiming: Look, the final merits determination was fast enough under the circumstances, civil litigation takes time, but I shouldn't be deprived of my property during the pendency of that.\n\nAnd, again, it's like the criminal analogy that I used earlier. You wouldn't say that because you have a speedy trial right and that's going to take a year that you don't also have a right to a prompt probable cause determination.\n\nAnd in a situation where, hypothetically, the trial did happen within a matter of days, that might moot the probable cause hearing or probable cause determination, but it wouldn't mean that conceptually you don't have two separate rights.\n\nJudge: And you could have two separate tests—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: —depending upon the claims?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct, with the Barker test—\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nForfeiture has been a critical tool for deterring crime since before the framing, and both history and precedent show what post-seizure process is due to those whose property has been seized.\n\nFrom historical legal precedents, the answer is clear. If the forfeiture proceeding is instituted and concluded promptly, then the forfeiture proceeding without more provides the post-seizure hearing required by due process.\n\nNow Petitioners assert that another post-seizure hearing is required, a mini-trial mere days or weeks after seizure, and in their telling, the federal government and the states have been violating fundamental rights for centuries with no one noticing until just a few years ago.\n\nBut their view cannot be squared with history or precedent, and their own cases show why a timely forfeiture proceeding is the meaningful opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time.\n\nOnly the timeliest test embodied in precedent accounts for the striking diversity among forfeiture cases. Some will be simple and others will involve wide-ranging investigations. Some claimants will vigorously press their rights and others will default.\n\nAs long as claimants can appear before judges promptly, then judges can strike that proper balance in each fact-bound case.\n\nNow I've heard my friend today say essentially don't trust judges to be judges. And so, instead, they invoke Mathews to have federal courts act as legislatures in handing down new Rules of Civil Procedure for all 50 states and the federal government.\n\nBut precedent best accounts for what should be the dispositive fact in these cases. The Petitioners were before state courts within two weeks of seizure, yet they ignored that process for over a year. Petitioners received all the process they were due, and this Court therefore should affirm.\n\nJudge: But you criticize the use of Mathews, but precedent applied here is a speedy trial case, so that would seem to also be an ill fit for determining whether or not you should have an additional hearing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think so, Your Honor. The Court considered multiple ways to measure speed, and the factors in that case are exactly the sorts of factors you imagine any judge would look to. How long has this taken? Why has it taken so long? Is the claimant pushing their rights? And has there been any prejudice?\n\nJudge: It seems that Petitioner is not talking as much about a timing issue as whether or not there should be an additional right vindicated.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right, Your Honor. But I think one advantage of precedent is that it really draws from history.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But you could have -- you could have land use decisions by a federal agency, where there's a lot -- a lot more is within the ambit of the federal agency to control.\n\nAnd maybe when you cut timber, there -- there could be some emissions that would go off -- off site or something like that that another agency may take account of or maybe not. But the -- it wouldn't be wrong for the landowner to say, in deciding whether to approve a project: I'm going to consider the emissions, I'm going to consider those other things because of -- I -- I feel like I have a special responsibility or a broader ambit because I'm leasing my own land. And, yes, maybe another agency could step in, but -- but the agency would still feel some responsibility.\n\nJudge:\nBut isn't that --\n\nJudge:\nAnd then to --\n\nJudge:\n-- overlapping jurisdiction? I had understood Lawyer of Plaintiff's test to be if it's in the jurisdiction of another agency, and so there's nothing that, here, you know, the STB could do about it. But what you're describing is -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.\n\nBut is what you're describing when there's overlapping jurisdiction so that the agency, like the STB or whatever, the Federal Highway Administration, could consider it, but so could another agency?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nOr they both -- or they both -- they both should consider it.\n\nIf -- within their -- within -- if there's overlapping regulatory jurisdiction, they both -- both should consider it. But there are also situations where another agency has great insight in -- in -- in what -- what might happen, technical expertise or something that the action agency could consult with. Now, here -- here, as I said, there's pretty stark separation for what the STB does or what its responsibility --\n\nJudge:\nBut how is that different from Lawyer of Plaintiff's test, is I guess what I'm getting at. I mean, is the situation you're talking about when another agency has insight that it can offer? Are you envisioning a situation in which there's not overlapping jurisdiction, or are you -- or it is overlapping jurisdiction?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, here, there is really not --\n\nJudge:\nWell, I -- I know, but I --\n\nJudge:\nMr. Lawyer of Defendant, isn't the answer it's not overlapping regulatory jurisdiction, but the -- the landowner with the timber has to decide under NEPA what informs their decision as to whether to chop down the timber? And so, even though they may not have jurisdiction over the area in which the emissions would fall, you would still expect that they would take into account, that they would look at, that they would study, in making their own determination about whether or not to cut down the trees on their land?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nRight.\n\nAnd in some situations even on federal land, there may be situations where another agency would also have jurisdiction but that for pollution --\n\nJudge:\nI -- I -- I understand -- I understand that.\n\nI'm not really disputing Judge's point here. I guess what I'm just trying to understand is nailing down the difference.\n\nI'm not hearing a ton of difference between Lawyer of Plaintiff's test and yours --\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah.\n\nJudge:\n-- on the jurisdictional point.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nYeah.\n\nI -- I -- I don't think there is.\n\nAs --\n\nJudge:\nOkay.\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\n-- as he said, I think we agree that -- that some -- sometimes the principles he's announcing will be dispositive or close to it, close to our rule.\n\nBut we think it -- we think the Court should preserve the -- the -- the possibility or -- or the likelihood in some cases, but --\n\nJudge:\nWell, maybe this is -- maybe this is unfair, but can you -- so far, in what you -- you've been talking about the -- the relevance of the agency's jurisdiction. But, if you add in the other element to the standard that he mentioned, remote in time and space, can you think of situations -- past cases or situations that you can anticipate where both of those factors are present where you think that his proposal would go too far?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I guess it depends what you mean by \"remote in time and place.\" I mean, one of -- one of the -- one of the differences that -- that I think I have on -- on the way Lawyer of Plaintiff was articulating it is he said -- he was saying focus only on the 88 miles.\n\nBut NEPA has long been understood to require assessment of some indirect effects. Direct effects are -- are normally what is right -- what -- in this case, what is happening on the 88 miles.\n\nJudge:\nSo that's what I think I'm trying to get at, is where? I mean, in what contexts would it be wrong to focus so clearly on just the 88 miles or just the area around whatever the project was?\n\nLawyer of Defendant:\nWell, I -- I think where the agency is setting in motion something that -- that is going to have effects, you know, off the property or -- or -- or out driving cars or -- or -- or future actions that might be taken because of the -- the development that I mentioned. And the Robertson decision from this Court is sort of instructive on that.\n\nThere was a question of whether the agency should grant a permit to build a ski resort in the mountains. And then there was the -- it was foreseen that there would be a -- hotels and -- and whatnot next to it.\n\nAnd the agency properly considered not just what was going to happen on the federal land that was being leased but what -- what private development would -- would happen.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "984", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Plaintiff\nThis is the -- this is a very rare case, rarely arises, so we've not made it.\n\nAnd it's also an argument that builds from Nasrallah, which is very recent too.\n\nSo the combination of the two, this is the first time that we made it in this case, first in a very -- in a very summary way and now more thoroughly here.\n\nJudge\nCan we -- this was not the question we granted cert on.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nJurisdiction, you're saying?\n\nJudge\nCorrect, jurisdiction.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nAnd if it were easy, then I can see just resolving it.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nBut the questions reveal that maybe it's not so easy.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nJudge\nIn that circumstance, is the prudent thing to do to -- to vacate and send it back so that the Tenth Circuit can consider the jurisdictional issue in the first instance? To the earlier question, it hasn't really percolated this kind of jurisdictional question, so I'm just trying to figure out what's sensible for us to do.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nYeah.\n\nWe would not object to that.\n\nWe also -- we think it's sufficiently clear ourselves as to --\n\nJudge\nRight.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\n-- but -- but, if the Court wants to, there's no harm in sending it back. You know, percolation --\n\nJudge\nI just don't want to make a mistake on something --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\n-- percolation helps.\n\nJudge\n-- that is jurisdictional and could have ramifications that are unforeseen.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nAnd we don't object to that.\n\nJudge\nThank you, counsel.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nThank you.\n\nJudge\nAnything further?\n\nLawyer of Defendant\nYou said that Nasrallah was one of the reasons we have this -- this -- this situation in this case now. Would you explain what you mean by that?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSo our position in Nasrallah was that all rulings in a removal proceeding were within the ambit of the term \"final order of removal.\" And we were doing that because there were exclusions of review of final orders of removal.\n\nAnd the court rejected that argument. The court said: The term \"final order of removal\" in 1252 is something more limited, relying on the statutory definition.\n\nIt is, one, things that find -- rulings that find the noncitizen deportable or order deportation.\n\nThose are -- that's it. Now, in addition, Nasrallah says that things that affect the validity of the final order will merge in the final order.\n\nAnd we would like to extend that to some other things too.\n\nWe think that if you raise an issue together with, under (b)(9), the zipper clause helps you, because it says you can raise it in judicial review of a final order of removal.\n\nBut you still have to have a final order of removal you're seeking review of.\n\nAnd we think things like withholding of removal, where it affects how you implement the final order of removal, even though it doesn't affect the validity of the final order of removal, that's close enough because we need to know how to implement the final order.\n\nThat is part of judicial review of the final order of removal under the zipper clause.\n\nSo those are the things that we think get covered, but all of them point back to some -- a final order of removal, and the reason is, is because the jurisdictional provision in 1252(a)(1) only grants jurisdiction over review of a final order of removal.\n\nThat's it.\n\nJudge\nAnything further?\n\nPlaintiff\nI'd like to go to agency practice.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nMm-hmm.\n\nPlaintiff\nIt was mentioned that, most of the time, the agency comes in to defend its practices.\n\nIn this very case, the immigration judge told the defendant that he had the extra two days.\n\nIt -- the summary of the March 5th oral ruling says the application for voluntary departure was granted until May 6th.\n\nThat's 62 days from March 5th.\n\nI understand from the amicus brief filed here that that was a consistent practice by immigration judges.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nI'm not sure that's correct, but I don't want to interrupt.\n\nPlaintiff\nBut some did.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff\nSome.\n\nPlaintiff\nOkay.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "630", "dialogue": "Judge: Is that cruel and unusual punishment for them to turn away someone who wants to use their shelter?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, that wouldn't be punishment. Punishment is the infliction of suffering for a crime.\n\nJudge: Well, then—then why is the Eighth Amendment implicated in this case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Because, here, we have fines and jail time. We have a status-based punishment scheme that is, in fact, inflicting punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nJudge: Counsel, do you want to—oh, I'm sorry. Were you finished?\n\nJudge: No, I'm done. That's fine.\n\nJudge: Do you want to address some of the line-drawing problems that we've been going back and forth? I mean, another judge pointed out that eating is a basic human need, and it's not the case that soup kitchens or social services will always be able to meet it. So they asked whether the Eighth Amendment would prohibit punishment for stealing food.\n\nYou might ask the same questions about trespass and squatting in structures if that was the best alternative.\n\nSo how do we draw these difficult lines about, you know, public urination and those sorts of things?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I'll start with stealing food. Stealing food is not part of the definition of homelessness, and it's also not a universal attribute.\n\nSo I put that outside the scope of any of the arguments we're making here. With respect to public urination and defecation, if you had a— I don't think this would ever exist, but if you had a law that said homeless people cannot urinate or defecate anywhere within city limits, I think then it starts to look like this case.\n\nBut if you're saying that people can't urinate or defecate on public property, it is almost—it's hard to imagine a situation where—\n\nJudge: They have no place else to go.\n\nSo a homeless person, there's no facilities available, and a homeless person has no place else to go. How could a—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You might have a—I mean, there are commercial establishments. I don't know that anyone's pointed to a jurisdiction where you truly don't have access. But if we had to say—\n\nJudge: Well, what's the constitutional principle?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: Take my hypothetical. Say there’s not—commercial establishments don’t want non-patrons coming in to use the facilities, there are no public facilities, and it's a generally applicable rule that says no public urination.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think, there, one distinction between urination and defecation and sleeping is that sleeping outside is part of the definition of homelessness, right? Homelessness is lacking a fixed, regular nighttime address. So the sleeping prohibition goes more directly to the status of homelessness than urination or defecation.\n\nJudge: So it would not violate the Eighth Amendment to punish public urination and defecation?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: You might come up with some different theory, but it's not the theory that we're putting forward in this case.\n\nJudge: Not the theory that you're—okay.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: What do you think of this idea that Oregon's necessity defense essentially functions as an Eighth Amendment in this context, so we don't have to constitutionalize the kinds of limits that you're talking about?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah, I would say it's not at all clear that that's true. As another lawyer pointed out, there is a necessity defense in Oregon law, but so far, the Oregon courts have not applied it to this circumstance.\n\nIt also wouldn't necessarily be available for the fines, the citations we have here.\n\nBut I think that this question about the availability of the necessity defense really goes to the injunctive posture of the case. It's not going to come up if you're in the—you know, you're—if you're presenting the Eighth Amendment as an affirmative defense at the same time as a necessity defense in a criminal prosecution, right, it kind of moots out the Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nBut going to another judge’s questions about injunctive relief, there, the question you're asking is, does the plaintiff have a credible threat of future punishment? I'd say first that the injunctive relief is not before the Court. The City has not challenged the propriety of the injunction here.\n\nSo I think it's a question for another day.\n\nThe courts here did find that the plaintiffs had shown a credible threat of future punishment, and so I think that resolves the issue for this case.\n\nJudge: Counsel, along those lines, we haven't mentioned it yet, but in the briefing, there's a lot of discussion about the fact that a previous Eighth Amendment holding with respect to status came without any adversarial testing, wasn't what was argued by the parties, it didn't have a whole lot of citation or support, it came kind of in a breezy paragraph.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And some have suggested that that's really a mistake because the Eighth Amendment's about punishments. It doesn't limit states' capacity to engage in passing laws that make conduct or actions or anything a crime.\n\nIt just goes to the nature of what punishments follow, putting aside the Excessive Fines Clause.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: So there's a lot of discussion in the brief about that and some suggestion that, really, it's the Fourteenth Amendment that should be doing work here, if there is work to be done, because some form of the necessity defense has always been understood as inhering in due process from the founding and whether that can be enforced through state laws, which might differ, but have to nonetheless cover the territory.\n\nAnd whether there might be injunctive relief on that basis, possible in advance, not limited to defenses, possible. Just reactions to that? We haven't yet touched on it.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So a previous ruling predates another case, but I think it espouses the same principle, which is, when you can identify an explicit textual source for a right, you locate the right in that amendment and not more generalized notions of due process.\n\nAnd so what the Court did was they—\n\nJudge: Well, but, here, the more— the more natural home for a necessity-type argument is due process. That's where it's always historically been understood to lie, not an amendment having to do with punishments, right?\n\nOne has to do with what you can criminalize. The other has to do with the punishments that follow.\n\nAnd you're not really attacking the punishments here.\n\nYou're saying any punishment is impermissible.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And any punishment is impermissible. And that is a necessity defense. That's a classic necessity defense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So I think that it's—it's right that a previous ruling describes what it was doing as saying that the Eighth Amendment prohibited the criminalization. You see that language in a couple of older cases. I agree it seems like a bit of a strange fit.\n\nJudge: So, if that's the case, wouldn't that get rid of this awful status/conduct distinction that we're struggling with here today?\n\nBecause, if it's a necessity, it doesn't matter why it's a necessity. Every person can make their own argument about why it was necessary, and then the courts will decide.\n\nWe don't get into the status/conduct stuff that a previous ruling seems to invite. Thoughts?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, but that's—here, we don't have necessarily a necessity defense, so that wouldn't be very satisfying—\n\nJudge: You don't think your clients have a good necessity defense?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The Oregon courts so far have not applied the Oregon—\n\nJudge: I didn't ask whether the courts—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

{"id": "554", "dialogue": "Plaintiff's Lawyer: So it's interesting, we today understand addiction as an immutable status. In Robinson, the Court suggested that someone might be recovered and no longer have the status of addiction. So the Robinson court wasn't thinking about addiction as something that couldn't change over time.\n\nJudge: Well, that may limit the applicability of Robinson to a different situation, but what is the -- I mean, what is the analytic approach to deciding whether something's a status or a situation of conduct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So the question is, a status is something that a person is when they're not doing anything. So being addicted, having cancer, being poor, are all statuses that you have apart from any conduct.\n\nJudge: Having cancer is not the same as being homeless, right? I mean, maybe I'm just repeating myself because homelessness can -- you -- you can remove the homeless status in an instant if you move to a shelter or situations otherwise change. And of course, it can be moved the other way as well if you're kicked out of the shelter, whatever. So that is a distinction from all these other things that have been labeled status, isn't it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I -- I don't think so because, you know, a cancer patient can go into remission, they no longer have that status. I don't think -- I mean, I don't think there's any question that being poor is a status. It's something that you are apart from anything you do. It's a status that can change over time and at that point you wouldn't be a part of the class but I don't think it changes the fact that it is a status. And what Robinson found so offensive about statuses is --\n\nJudge: Well, I guess is -- is being a bank robber a status?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, because being a bank robber means you rob banks. So -- so the definition and the conduct --\n\nJudge: Violating this ordinance means upon being asked to leave you don't leave.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Violating this ordinance means you're homeless. So again, homelessness is not something that you do. It's just something that you are. And so the question becomes, when you attach the universal human attribute of sleeping or breathing to that status, does it make the punishment conduct-based instead of status-based? And I think the answer is --\n\nJudge: Counsel, Edwards v. California in 1941 struck down a law that made it a crime to transport an indigent person, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: Indigency is a not -- is a condition that can change over time, but the law was aimed at the transport of a person who wasn't morally reprehensible.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. I think that's notable because our history and tradition as a country is to emphatically reject any sort of local legislative scheme that has the effect of pushing the burdens of poverty or indigency into other communities. It's woven throughout our Constitution. So Edwards located it in the Dormant Commerce Clause. We have Saenz v. Roe which locates it in the Privileges of Immunities Clause; Papachristou addresses that status-based punishment in the context of procedural due process. What Robinson held is that when that expulsion is effectuated through status-based punishment, it violates the Punishments Clause.\n\nJudge: How do you define a community? So when another judge was describing how New Jersey has so many tightly woven municipalities close together and here, you know, the Chief Justice was asking about whether if Grants Pass, if there was a new homeless shelter with lots of beds right across the border 10 minutes away, you know, could that be taken into account? And I think there was some back and forth and not necessarily agreement on that. What is your position? How do you define a community? Take that example of a homeless shelter right outside the limits of Grants Pass.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes. So to -- so to answer that hypothetical first, I'm not concerned -- I don't have any problems with saying that a homeless person in Grants Pass has legal and physical access to a shelter that's just over the lines, if that's, in fact, true. Lots of jurisdictions limit their homeless shelters to people who are residents. So -- and just to be clear, there was no suggestion in the record here that there were any shelters available outside of Grants Pass.\n\nJudge: Understood. But so community doesn't need to be determined by jurisdictional lines, is what you're telling me --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: -- as a matter of -- because, let's see, I'm asking all of this because, in response to another judge, you were pointing out that our -- you know, our nation has a history and tradition of not saying you can shunt homeless people or the poor out of your jurisdiction and on to others. So -- or out of your community and on to others, is I think how you -- how you phrased it. So I'm asking, how do we know what those lines are? And you're saying it doesn't have to be jurisdiction-specific.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No. I think jurisdiction matters because that tells us kind of the lines in which the -- whatever ordinance or statute applies. So, when shelter is available, the ordinances are enforceable because they punish the conduct of not going to the shelter, as opposed to the status of homelessness. So I think that a -- a municipality can punish the conduct of not going to a shelter that's just over the line if you have physical and legal access to it. Now, for the reasons you say -- and this dates back to our settlement system at the Founding Era -- a lot of municipalities do not allow people from outside of the jurisdiction to use their shelters, and so, under those circumstances, the shelter wouldn't be legally available.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

So what is wrong with that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nI'm -- I'm glad I have the opportunity to address Figure F because this is the --this is the basis for my friend's statement that the complaint \"eats itself.\" And I think that's just not so.\r\n\r\nThe -- he's referring to the slide that's at page 62 from the internal China presentation, and the data there actually falsifies Mr. Huang's public statements. So the three bars there on the bar chart -- and I realize I sound like I'm in a district court argument -- but these three bar -- bars are reflecting the sales for the second quarter, the second quarter of the Fiscal Year 2018, but this is in 2017.\r\n\r\nAnd it shows that the majority of sales are -- to crypto miners are GeForce GPU units.\r\n\r\nAnd it also is inconsistent with the public statement that -- that Mr. Huang made about that quarter, when asked about the second quarter earnings, that the SKU was capturing the majority of the sales.\r\n\r\nThat isn't true. And then immediately after the period of this slide, the public data released by NVIDIA shows that the OEM segment, the crypto SKU segment, dropped dramatically.\r\n\r\nAnd so it's not consistent with the idea that there's a trend in -- in -- in that direction.\r\n\r\nIt's not consistent with the statements that Mr. Huang made publicly. So this -- this slide is actually -- this is the thing that they pointed to to help them, but it actually shows in fairly granular detail much more than the PSLRA demands because we don't have to prove our case in a summary judgment-like fashion, but it shows that the statements were false.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell, Judge --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThat's a --\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- Judge Sanchez said that he thought that the slide showed that the crypto SKU was drawing sales away.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nAmong miners, it was drawing sales away from the GeForce GP -- GPU.\r\n\r\nIs that incorrect?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nI --you know, I don't -- don't -- don't think it is.\r\n\r\nAnd I think this goes to some of the -- what I heard from my friend is addressing a conspiracy theory that we didn't advance and are not advancing. We are not saying that the crypto SKU didn't capture some of the sales to miners, and we're not saying that the company engaged in accounting fraud in misstating those revenues.\r\n\r\nIt stated those revenues. The problem was that it equated crypto demand with the line item regarding the SKU, which led analysts to be misled consistently to think that there wasn't crypto demand that was driving the GeForce sales when, in fact, it was.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nSo I'm focused a little bit on the demands of particularity at this stage. You -- you -- in part of your response to Justice Alito right there, you said we don't have to prove our case in a summary judgment-like fashion. And -- and that's what I thought, but I'm just wondering whether that's actually the case.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice asks, well, what was the point of the PR --P -- PSLRA? And --and is it possible that the PSLRA was really, with its particularity requirement, demanding that plaintiffs have the kinds of evidence that would be necessary to demonstrate the inferences that they would want the Court to draw?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nSo I think this Court in Tellabs rejected exactly that argument.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't understand my friend to be asking you to overrule that portion of Tellabs.\r\n\r\nSo Tellabs holds that we don't have to meet a summary judgment-like standard or present more proof than we would need to present at trial. Now I think, if this were a district court and we were having a summary judgment argument, I'd like our chances because we have quite a lot of evidence.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nAnd I appreciate that, but I -- I guess I'm just trying to understand what the standard is.\r\n\r\nWhat --so, if you don't have to demonstrate through the presentation of evidence that your inferences are correct or that you have enough evidence to show a jury that your inferences are correct, then what is the work of particularity? I mean, your -- your colleague on the other side suggests that you do have to have enough detail about the contents of the documents in order to do something.\r\n\r\nBut I can't separate that out from saying you have to have the documents themselves --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- in some way.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nI --I think this -- this colloquy shows the -- the wisdom of the Court's consistent refusal to adopt bright-line rules.\r\n\r\nI -- I acknowledge that there are going to be some cases where the plaintiffs' failure to allege the contents of documents is going to be fatal.\r\n\r\nBut there are going to be a great many cases in which there's a holistic analysis of all of the -- the mix of facts where that's not necessary, and I think, actually, Tellabs on remand and Matrixx are two such cases.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThank you, counsel. If I could just pick up on that point.\r\n\r\nIn requiring particularity, the PSLRA was at least raising the bar when you talk about, you know, you have to have some evidence of this or that.\r\n\r\nCongress went out and saw a real problem there and wanted to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo the idea that, oh, you're going to have varying levels of particularity with respect to the evidence is kind of a hard standard to apply. I mean, if it is just, oh, you look -- you know, it's a case-by-case basis, and we're going to have to wait for 25 or however many years until some general rule is distilled, it doesn't seem to me that the statute is doing what they meant it to do.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nWell, I -- I think the statute is doing what they meant it to do, and I think the proof is in the -- in the lower court jurisprudence. I think, if you look at all of the -- the cases cited in the cert petition, we don't really have any quarrel with those cases.\r\n\r\nThey are engaging in a -- a fairly fact-bound analysis in each of those cases about whether the rules of particularity are met. And it's not easy.\r\n\r\nThe standard is not easy to meet.\r\n\r\nThis is -- my friend is right when he said that this is a --a standard that is different from the -- the typical standard, and that's why you get complaints that take up as much of the Joint Appendix as this complaint does.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nWell, I'm not sure what they were looking for is verbosity.\r\n\r\nI mean -- (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nFair.\r\n\r\nFair.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n--I hope not anyway.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nYes, and, in fact, there are some cases where the courts are saying your complaint is too long.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nAnd -- and, you know, so I think it's not just length.\r\n\r\nIt has to be detailed, and it has to be detail that is sufficient, as -- as the Court said in Tellabs, to -- to negate or at least to show that there as --the inferences are as compelling as any competing inference.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nThank -- thank you. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nDo you think that motive has any role to play in the analysis of scienter? I know you don't have to prove motive.\r\n\r\nDo you think it's relevant?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nI think this Court has said that it's -- it's relevant but not necessary.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\nSo, if the -- I mean, if the real figure is one and a half billion dollars or over a billion dollars and Mr. Huang says no, it's a hundred million --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n-- what motive could he have for making a statement that is so far off and that is, if you are correct, if the over a billion dollars figure is correct, is surely going to be -- going to come to light with severe consequences?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff\r\nThat's the argument my friends make.\r\n\r\nAnd I think you could have made --\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "779", "dialogue": "Judge: But isn't that about liability again? You know, so that's kind of going back -- maybe it was Justice Thomas before.\r\n\r\nI can't remember who.\r\n\r\nBut is there a difference between jurisdiction and liability? Because I don't think anybody would deny that Hungary, even if it commingled all these funds, still would owe the money.\r\n\r\nBut the question here is a little bit different, right? It's is the money present for jurisdictional purposes.\r\n\r\nDoes that bear on the question?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I -- my fundamental point would be I don't think that the tracing rules should apply here.\r\n\r\nIf you did look at them, then you should look at them through the lens of that language that I was quoting from Spiller.\r\n\r\nBut the reason I think the tracing rules don't apply here, those are really rules that come out of equity cases.\r\n\r\nSo, when this -- not to turn this into an ERISA case, but, in ERISA, Congress specifically said -- in Section 502(a)(3), it referred to equitable relief.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in cases like Great West and Sereboff and Montanile, this Court had to delve into these archaic distinctions in equity about what kind of tracing was required in particular circumstances.\r\n\r\nThat's not what Congress did when it passed this jurisdictional provision in the FSIA which codifies the common law.\r\n\r\nThe FSIA comes from common law.\r\n\r\nWe know that from cases like Samantar.\r\n\r\nAnd so Congress wasn't invoking these equitable principles in this --in the -- in the FSIA.\r\n\r\nThe tracing rules don't provide the answer here.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Dvoretzky, can I ask you just a question about other cases in this area? So we have the Second Circuit case and the D.C. Circuit case on this question.\r\n\r\nHas this commingling theory been used under the expropriation exception before, in other cases before -- besides the two that created the split here?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Not that I'm aware. So, in terms of the international consequence -- the foreign relations consequences of reading the expropriation exception our way, there has not been a flood of cases that have been brought.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of other cases besides -- besides those two and some other Holocaust -- Holocaust litigation.\r\n\r\nJudge: If -- if we accept the plaintiffs' theory -- or Petitioners' theory or the government's theory, they -- at least the government said there's no difference between the two.\r\n\r\nIf we say -- and I'm not suggesting you're losing.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Good.\r\n\r\nJudge: Just a hypothetical, okay? If we say that you have -- you --the historical commingling theory's not enough, that you need in some way to identify the property, does your complaint survive, or do we just reverse and order dismissal?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So our complaint survives.\r\n\r\nJudge: That's -- then we do have to reach the who bears the burden of proof, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Well, I don't think you do on this record because of the evidence that we have already put in that Hungary has not tried to refute.\r\n\r\nAnd so the issue -- the issue here --\r\n\r\nJudge: That's my whole point.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to imagine, if I have a bank account, that I put a hundred dollars in it today and after 80 years --I'm not quite 80, I'm 70 -- but, after 70 years, that that same hundred remains in that account under any theory.\r\n\r\nEvery passing year, I have a flood of money going out, I have a flood of money coming in.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting concept that that $100 that my mother put in that account the day I was born, that a piece of it is still there 60 years or 70 years or 80 years later.\r\n\r\nIt's a fiction that takes quite an imagination.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So -- so two points, Justice Sotomayor.\r\n\r\nOne, Hungary could have tried to refute but didn't liquidation and commingling in the first place.\r\n\r\nThey didn't dispute --they didn't dispute that.\r\n\r\nAnd that is something that a foreign sovereign could -- could disagree --\r\n\r\nJudge: Let's assume that they --they took that 5 million -- billion, million dollars and put it in.\r\n\r\nWhat they came in and said: You can't trace that money now. There's been so much money that's come in and gone out over 80 years, there's no way to say that any of that remains.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Let me -- let me try this.\r\n\r\nNot quite 80 years, but I think that if I had not been a summer associate during law school, if I had chosen to take the summer off, I would have deposited less money back then and, as a result, I would have less money in my bank accounts today.\r\n\r\nNow you could say: Oh, no, you spent your summer associate salary on tuition.\r\n\r\nThat's gone.\r\n\r\nBut --\r\n\r\nJudge: All right.\r\n\r\nSo let's get to the bottom line.\r\n\r\nYou're saying to me that we have to -- that this case -- the end of this case depends on us reaching the question of the burden of -- who bears the burden of pleading this?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't think it does. First, if the commingling theory is valid, as we argue that it is --\r\n\r\nJudge: I gave you a different hypothetical.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: If the commingling theory is not valid, do you need to reach the burden shifting -- burden shifting? At that point, I would still say that you don't because of the unrebutted facts in this record.\r\n\r\nBut, if you do reach the burden -shifting theory -- burden-shifting argument, the burden of persuasion there ought to be on the defendants, on the foreign state.\r\n\r\nYes, this Court has referred to foreign sovereign immunity as jurisdictional, but it's an odd kind of jurisdictional inquiry. Jurisdiction --subject matter jurisdiction generally can't be waived by statute.\r\n\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction here can be waived.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of litigation strategy, Hungary has -- as Justice Gorsuch pointed out, Hungary has said that it bears the burden of persuasion.\r\n\r\nAnd Hungary in this situation is the party with superior access to the information.\r\n\r\nIt has extensive records of what it did with expropriated property.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Dvoretzky, you don't dispute, though, that you bear the burden of production at this stage of showing an exchange, correct?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Correct.\r\n\r\nJudge: So whatever --\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: -- once they dispute -- once --\r\n\r\nJudge: -- whatever that standard is, you acknowledge that you bear the burden of production to meet it?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Once they dispute our factual allegations as to that, yes, then the burden shifts to us in order to show that, in fact, our property --\r\n\r\nJudge: And they -- they -- they say under a proper standard, there is no exchange here, and you'd -- under their standard, you'd have to meet that, if --if the Court were to adopt their view of what an exchange means?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think that's right.\r\n\r\nJudge: Okay.\r\n\r\nSo, really, the burden of persuasion question isn't before us in that sense.\r\n\r\nIt's really who bears the burden of -- what the burden of persuasion -- sorry, the burden of production is with respect to an exchange?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Right.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that's often true in burden cases, that at the end of the day, once you have both sides' evidence in the case, unless it is perfectly in equipoise, which it very, very rarely will be, the Court is just going to weigh the two sides' evidence and decide by a preponderance who's right.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

Mr. Thompson did not understate the number in response to a specific numeric inquiry about how much he borrowed.\n\nJudge\nI guess I don't know exactly where this requirement of a specific inquiry comes from.\n\nI mean, there can be various contextual things that go to whether a statement is true or false.\n\nOne of them is what did they ask you.\n\nBut there are other ways in which --you know, if I say I made a hundred thousand dollars and I'm speaking of Canadian dollars, but everybody listening to me is thinking you're in the United States, of course, they're thinking American dollars.\n\nI mean, that's just false if I say I made a hundred thousand dollars and, in fact, I made $70,000 or $130,000, or whichever way the exchange rate goes.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nJudge\nBut, you know, so I guess I don't get this, like, oh, it's got to be an inquiry.\n\nI mean, there was an implicit inquiry here.\n\nThe guy was calling to say: You got the number wrong.\n\nIt's just as if somebody had said: Did we get the number wrong? And he said: You got the number wrong, it's $110,000, when it was, in fact, $260,000.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nI --I don't think so, Judge, and -- or, Your Honor, because the -- the statement he made was tied to the personal note.\n\nAnd that was true also of the call with the FDIC.\n\nIt -- it's true that a statement that is volunteered can be a false statement.\n\nSo, if Mr. Thompson had walked into the bank and shouted, \"I only borrowed $110,000, and not a penny more,\" that would be a false statement.\n\nBut, instead, what happened is that the re's this invoice about what he borrowed --what he owed, and he made a statement about what he borrowed under his personal note. And I think that the --the -- the -- the clearest evidence of the -- that that is not a false statement comes from the government's concession on our motion for judgment of acquittal that --\n\nJudge\nI -- I'm a little -- I'm totally confused, okay? He took the statement the bank sent to him --I'm quoting him: \"I have no idea.\n\nThe numbers you sent me show that I have a loan for $269,000.\n\nI borrowed a hundred thousand, period.\" So, if he borrowed 219, 215, 150, 160, it wasn't the hundred thousand he said.\n\nI don't see how that's literally true.\n\nThat's literally false.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nYour Honor --\n\nJudge\nHe borrowed more than he said he did.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nJustice, I think that by putting the period after the $110,000, we're not getting the full context of his statement.\n\nHe said a few more words about the circumstances, and then he said, \"I had a note for $110,000,\" so that I think that his statement --\n\nJudge\nSo he had a note for 110,000 might be true, but he was asked: What did you borrow? And he said: Only a hundred thousand.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nWith respect, Your Honor --\n\nJudge\nI -- I --I -- I don't understand how -- how --this is, I think, where Justice Barrett is confused, which is, if the question is did you enter 50 times, and he says I only -- I entered 10 times, it's not literally true.\n\nIt -- it's literally false that he entered 10 times.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nI agree that the -- the hypothetical is a false statement.\n\nBut Mr. Thompson was not asked how much he borrowed. The implicit question is what the total debt was.\n\nJudge\nAll right.\n\nSo, as I read the jury instruction here, the jury instruction didn't use the word \"misleading.\" It said: Was his statement false?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nCorrect.\n\nJudge\nSo the issue here now is would a rational juror have concluded that this was a false statement, correct?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\n\nJudge\nSo I -- I hate the word \"literally\" because I don't know what it means.\n\nI think that the question is: Did he make a false statement?

Is it the objective listener, what -- what -- how that person would understand it, or do you go back and say, well, if he knew about it, then it definitely is false, but if he had -- you know, was confused, then maybe it's not false?

{"id": "839", "dialogue": "Judge: We'll hear argument next in Case 23-677, Royal Canin versus Wullschleger.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit's decision below is an extreme outlier.\n\nIt conflicts with the text and structure of Section 1367 and with more than a century of precedent.\n\nJudge: Chief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a diversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be divested by subsequent events.\n\nThe Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against American Soda in 1904.\n\nAnd in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul Mercury that if the plaintiff after removal amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice.\n\nThe second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -Mellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in 2007.\n\nDefendant: Respondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation, claiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367.\n\nBut Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of Section 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress expressly provided otherwise.\n\nRespondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision of a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise that supports their position.\n\nDefendant: Respondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to decide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not, whether Grable's requirements were met.\n\nJudge: This Court did not grant certiorari on either question.\n\nGrable is settled law, and the Eighth Circuit correctly applied it here.\n\nThe Court should affirm its longstanding precedent and reverse the decision below.\n\nI welcome the Court's questions.\n\nJudge: You mentioned Section 1367.\n\nCould you spend a few minutes on your argument as to how it disposes of -- supports your argument?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Certainly, Your Honor.\n\nSo the text of Section 1367 states that there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\n\nAnd the text of Section 1367 does not say that when a plaintiff amends the complaint to delete the federal question, there is no longer supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nAnd that's exactly the interpretive approach that this Court adopted in Exxon Mobil against Allapattah, where the Court was trying to figure out what does Section 1367 say about Rule 23 and plaintiffs in class actions.\n\nAnd the Court looked at Section 1367, said it doesn't say anything about Rule 23, and that means that there is supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nThere are also some important structural inferences here.\n\nSo Section 1367(c)(3) makes clear that where the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, it can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nAnd that really disposes of the argument that there has to be an ongoing federal question in the case in order for supplemental jurisdiction to be warranted.\n\nCongress didn't intend that here.\n\nJudge: So do you think, Ms. Wellington, that -- let's say this wasn't a removal case.\n\nLet's say this was an original case and it was brought in federal court, and then the plaintiff took out the federal claim, leaving only state claims.\n\nIs there supplemental jurisdiction there?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So this Court has treated these two situations differently, and Justice Scalia explained why in Rockwell.\n\nSo there was a concern in Rockwell that when a plaintiff goes into federal court, pleads a federal question, and then immediately or subsequently drops it, that they're trying to plead their way into federal court.\n\nJudge: So forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule that once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out the federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that point for the federal court to do? It's not a doctrine of discretion anymore. The federal court has to dismiss.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That is how we have asked this Court to read Rockwell.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce brief, you know --\n\nJudge: I just --\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- want to make sure.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: That is our view.\n\nJudge: So, if that's the case, I don't think that your arguments from 1367 can be right because your arguments from 1367 would suggest the opposite result in the case that I gave.\n\nIn other words, it's very hard to read 1367 as imposing some kind of distinction between original cases and removed cases.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So I agree, Your Honor, that there is no distinction in the text of 1367 itself.\n\nThis Court could revisit its decision in Rockwell or limit it to the FCA context.\n\nWe haven't asked the Court to do that because we think that we win on the text here. We think, if you just --\n\nJudge: I guess what it suggests to me, though, is, if you were willing to say, look, the Rockwell understanding of original cases is settled, we're not contesting that, then I think your arguments from 1367 go away because 1367 just doesn't create the kind of distinction that you're asking us to create.\n\nSo either you lose as to removed cases too, or these arguments from the text are just not going to get us to your result.\n\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So we disagree, Your Honor, with your interpretation of the text of Section 1367.\n\nWe think Congress has made clear that there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\n\nIt hasn't done that.\n\nAnd I think it's very important to consider how Congress came to write Section 1367.\n\nIt was in response to Finley, where this Court took an extremely narrow view of pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction, pendent-party jurisdiction in particular, and Congress said no, that's not what we want.\n\nWe want a broader view of pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction. And that's why they wrote this very broad statute here.\n\nAnd it would be very strange to conclude that Congress intended to abrogate Cohill.\n\nIt was decided just two years before it enacted --\n\nJudge: That's the point.\n\nJudge: But Cohill --\n\nJudge: Sorry.\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "461", "dialogue": "Judge: I was just going to say that seems to be flatly contrary to what—you know, the quote from Justice Frankfurter, which I don't remember. He said that's something that's been in the body politic from the very beginning, that the United States has control over its borders with respect to non-citizens who seek to come in.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But not, Your Honor, when the rights of a U.S. citizen are implicated. And the position that the government has put my client in is that she's been permanently separated from the man that she loves for eight years without having any basis, any chance when there was an opportunity to respond under the regulations, to try and convince them that they made a mistake. Let me—\n\nJudge: Just pause very briefly. She's not been permanently separated from the man that she loves. That person is not allowed to be admitted into the United States.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But at the same time, Your Honor—\n\nJudge: That's a different question.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Not entirely, Your Honor, because the government cannot dilute an American citizen's citizenship by forcing them to—by giving them the chance to exercise their liberty interests only by forfeiting the protection of the Constitution. El Salvador is under martial law. The State Department warns American citizens not to travel there. And my client was born and raised in this country. She has a successful law practice here. Her father served in the U.S. Army in World War II in Germany.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I want you to assume a few things for me, and some of the assumptions you'll like and some of the assumptions you won't like. But I just want you to assume them, and then I'll ask my questions.\n\nSo assume that you get Mandel review because you have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in cohabiting with a spouse. Assume that that review is limited and asks only for a bona fide and legitimate reason. Assume that the information that you got eventually, not in a timely way, but eventually, perfectly satisfies that demand for a bona fide legitimate reason.\n\nBut you didn't get it in time, as I understand the issue. You didn't get it in time to invoke the reconsideration processes that the State Department usually has for exactly this purpose. Is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: That's correct, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So if I think that the simple statement, \"he was an MS-13 member,\" is sufficient under Mandel, but you didn't get it in time to invoke the reconsideration process to say, \"No, you got that wrong, he wasn't an MS-13 member,\" what do we do now?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Then I think the Court would have to remand so that the individual could have an opportunity to try and prove to the consulate that they may have made a mistake.\n\nAnd there's a big, big difference between \"any other unlawful activity\"—\n\nJudge: You're saying that what we should do now, given that the information that satisfies Mandel was untimely, is essentially to tell everybody they should be put back in the box they were in before that information became untimely; is that correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: In order to be able to harness the facts to overcome that determination, that's right, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: So the only relief you seek is the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration at the consulate? Is that it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, with the caveat that the government's inadmissibility determination would have to be declared to be incorrect.\n\nJudge: Now, if that's the case, I don't see that in your complaint, number one. And, number two, what do we do with the observations that, as a practical matter, it appears your client understood, before the motion for reconsideration deadline passed, that that was indeed the basis of the government's denial—that she understood that the gang membership and MS-13 was the hang-up? Now, you didn't know all the details, but you did understand that fact.\n\nAnd if that fact alone sufficed to provide the Mandel notice, is this harmless error?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: No, and let me try and take the second part of Your Honor's question first. My client and her husband did not guess correctly. The government—at page 107 and 108 of the Joint Appendix below—the government said that the tattoos were merely the suspicion which triggered the inquiry.\n\nSo there was no correct guess of the factual basis for the denial at all.\n\nJudge: No, but I think that's slicing the baloney a little thinly, counsel, because, yes, you thought the tattoos were the basis. But you thought the tattoos were the basis because they suggested gang membership, which is exactly what the government thought too.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But even there, there is a very significant difference between gang membership—there are hundreds of these gangs—and the specific gang that they ultimately provided three years later.\n\nNow, I'll be very concrete with how we would have done this differently if we'd have even known that bit of information—\n\nJudge: Does Mandel require specificity of the particular gang that he was affiliated with? Wouldn't it be enough for the government to say he's affiliated with an international gang that conducts violence and drug-trafficking operations, for example?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It wouldn't be enough if there were additional facts that did not implicate national security, like the facts which were ultimately provided here, that it was based on a criminal review—\n\nJudge: Let's just suppose that it were enough.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Then, yes, that would be the end of the case. But—\n\nJudge: End of the case? That would be harmless error, then?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: But there—well, no, because, again, this— it wasn't enough here because there's no additional fact on the record that would have allowed my client to have any idea how this man—\n\nJudge: No, no, but I think—\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: —who's never been convicted or charged of any crime—\n\nJudge: I understand that. I appreciate that fact. But if your client understood that gang membership was the problem, and if the government said \"gang membership,\" if that were enough to satisfy Mandel, why doesn't it follow that any error here is harmless?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, to clarify—and I don't want to put too fine a point on it—but that would only be enough if you're talking about such a significant figure that even indicating what gang he may belong to would implicate national security. In almost all cases, there’s going to be facts that can—\n\nJudge: I don't know whether it would implicate national security. I'm positing it might satisfy Mandel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "107", "dialogue": "Judge: I think the government's broad argument is it's very odd when someone gets notice of the time and date of the hearing and skips it intentionally, flouting the system, thumbing your nose at the system, and then comes back when they're caught and says, oh, that removal in absentia was no good. Why? Oh, because I didn't have notice of the time and date of the hearing, when we know -- so I think that's the government's kind of overarching concern about reading the statute your way.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure, Your Honor.\nSo I think that the problem is you can't just look at this provision in isolation, right? So what Congress thought it was doing was it was giving the government all the cards.\nIf you don't want -- if you don't want someone to skip the hearing, just put these seven pieces of information on the notice to appear, and then they can't skip the hearing. There are other places in the scheme that allow for consideration of exactly the kind of fault analysis you're talking about.\n\nSo, for instance, you know, if you get to reopen your hearing, you may be ineligible for various forms of discretionary removal under 1229a(b)(7) if you're that person who gets, you know, notice -- oral notice of the date and time of the hearing and just doesn't show up.\nAs some of the Justices have alluded to, there may be some residual discretion embedded in the \"may\" in (b)(5) that gives the IJ some discretion. All we're talking about is the eligibility criteria to even be able to file a motion to reopen.\n\nAnd at that stage, Congress didn't ask about notice generally, notice of the time of the hearing.\nIt asked about notice in accordance with these two provisions that prescribe a particular format for the information.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel. You said that Congress thought the government would do its best.\nI mean, as a practical matter, is it possible for the government to be able to put in the orders a time that they'll stick to? I mean, is -- there's a reason they say, you know, TBA or TBD, right? And yet, you seem to think that we ought to analyze it as if the facts on the ground are not what they are, which may be right.\n\nI mean, if Congress doesn't like it, maybe they can change it. But it -- it seems to me, at least in terms of practicalities, to say, well, they ought to put the time on when they issue the order, and if they don't, all these consequences are going to follow.\nThe government makes the argument that, well, there are a lot -- they're just not able to do that.\n\nAnd if there's a reading of the statute that makes more sense or at least sense to deal with the situation on the ground, is that something we should consider?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think the -- the short answer is no, but I also want to push back on the premise of the question.\n\nSo no, again, Pereira and Niz-Chavez, the government gave you the same arguments, and this Court said --\n\nJudge: Yeah, but, you know, Pereira and Niz-Chavez, of course, dealt with an entirely different question.\nSo --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Sure.\nSo --\n\nJudge: -- push -- push back on the --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: On the premise of your question, following Pereira, as my friend on the other side has told you, the government has been able to, in the mine run of cases, put dates and times in these notices.\n\nAnd the immigration judges' brief tells us that there was until 2014 a scheduling system that as far as these former immigration judges understand, had the ability to schedule these date and time of the hearings. So that evidence that prior to 2014, there was a scheduling system, post-Pereira the government's been able to do it, strongly suggests that actually the government has had the ability to do this and has chosen not to, despite knowing, as this Court put it in Niz-Chavez, since 1996 that this was a requirement.\n\nJudge: Do you have any idea how often the -- when the government puts in an original time that that time sticks or hasn't been extended later on or --\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I -- I don't have those numbers, Your Honor.\nBut I'll note that prior to 1996, Congress gave the government the option, right? It said you could put the -- the date and time in the order to show cause, which was the predecessor to the NTA, or somewhere else if you couldn't do it. And in 1996, Congress made the decision that it was no longer going to kind of excuse the government from putting the date and time in the initial document, and it did that with a full understanding, right, the government testified at that hearing, of the logistical problems of doing so.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?\n\nJudge: If the -- the date that the government puts in an NTA is sort of an aspirational date, but in a good percentage of those cases, they end up having to change the date, is that -- is that system better for non-citizens than a system that would tolerate the TBD in the initial NTA?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So Congress made the determination it was better.\n\nAnd I think that's because of what I said to Justice Kagan; namely, the NTA is the document that's generally handed to the non-citizen.\nIt's the one you know they got.\n\nAnd at the very least, if they have some date and time, they can come to immigration court and find out that their hearing was moved; whereas, if they have no information about when and where to show up, except for a document that's mailed that may or may not reach them, then they may never clarify when that is.\n\nJudge: Well, that doesn't really answer the question, because they may be handed a document, an NTA with an aspirational date, but if they are later sent a document with a change, mailed to the address that they provide, you know, they're in the same situation.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So, Your Honor, I think that's precisely the argument that was made in dissent in Niz-Chavez.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I know.\nI'm not asking you about -- I know -- I'm not asking you about Pereira and Niz-Chavez.\nI'm not asking that they be overruled, even though -- (Laughter.)\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: I'm asking you about what might make some bit of sense.\nBut, if you just want to say Pereira and Niz-Chavez, we can leave it at that.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Well, maybe I'll just cite the majority in Niz-Chavez, which said that we think another result is more likely still, which is that the government will develop its computer systems and technology to put forward dates that are likely to stick.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: I -- all dates are aspirational. (Laughter.)\nBut, in the mine run of cases, the first appearance, like the first appearance when you're arraigned, you don't accomplish much substantively.\n\nThere's not decisions on whether you're going to be convicted or not at an arraignment generally, unless you're going to plead guilty.\nBut, even then, time is usually given for people to confer with counsel and do other things. I'm assuming that this time -- TBA, as you explained, is just the start of the process, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think that's exactly right, Your Honor, and so the reason you need that date is, for instance, to be able to get an attorney, right?\n\nJudge: Thank you.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "777", "dialogue": "Judge: On the question of whether you've had difficulty convicting mules in the Fifth Circuit, it reminds me of Rule 10,000 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which used to be applied by district judges to exclude evidence that prosecutors wanted to admit. It was the \"you don't need it\" rule. So, if you don't need it and there's a conceivable possibility that it might create an issue on appeal, the judge would keep it out. Do you think we ought to create that rule, making it an enforceable, judge-made addition to the Federal Rules of Evidence?\n\nProsecution: No. The federal government opposes that rule. (Laughter.) There’s a metaphor in the Advisory Committee notes to Rule 401, from Professor McCormick, stating that a brick is not a wall. What he meant was you have to build your case up brick by brick. Every brick is not itself going to be dispositive of the whole case, but they’re helpful. We are entitled to present reliable and helpful evidence of the defendant’s guilt and of guilt generally in cases like this. The question shouldn’t be whether we need it, but whether it is prohibited by the Federal Rules or the Constitution, and this testimony is not.\n\nJudge: Justice Sotomayor?\n\nJudge: So, you have not backed off your answer to the other justices that if a 100% inference is pointing to the defendant, that is a functional equivalency, and you would agree that should be excluded. But you say it should be excluded under a different rule perhaps. However, you didn't even go that far. You said under Rule 704 that might cross the line—to say that every defendant with schizophrenia doesn’t know right from wrong or knows right from wrong because some expert could say schizophrenia doesn’t cloud your mind, it just makes you believe you have a reason to do it. So which is it?\n\nProsecution: Two points. First, if I muddled things this morning, I regret it. But the key thing from our point of view about the application of Rule 704(b) is whether the testimony is framed in terms of the defendant. The opposing counsel gets some mileage out of hypotheticals that refer to a class that obviously includes or necessarily includes the defendant. I think it really does matter whether the expert takes the stand and opines about the defendant in particular. That’s the key dividing line—\n\nJudge: Well, I think we all agree on that. If the expert says the defendant knew, that's a violation of the rule.\n\nProsecution: That’s right.\n\nJudge: The question is when the expert says the defendant—when all people who have X, Y, and Z know, you're willing to say that if all people who have X, Y, and Z know, then it has to be this defendant, correct?\n\nProsecution: Well, the key question in that hypothetical would be whether the testifying expert has explicitly put the defendant in that class.\n\nJudge: Well, the expert is only there because—\n\nProsecution: If all that is at issue is that the jury could infer from other evidence—\n\nJudge: So how about if the expert says 99.9% know? 95% know? 90% know? Where do we draw the line?\n\nProsecution: I don’t think that’s the line Rule 704(b) draws. It’s not a rule about categorical versus conditional testimony. It’s a rule about expert opinion testimony about the defendant.\n\nJudge: About a defendant’s mental state?\n\nProsecution: Yes. And if you have concerns in a particular case that an expert opinion is overstating the certainty with which they describe some fact of the world, that’s a problem under Rule 702 and Daubert, not under Rule 704(b).\n\nJudge: Justice Kagan?\n\nJudge: The opposing counsel might have some line-drawing problems, but I think you do too. If I understand what you’re saying now, on the one hand, if an expert got up and said 100% of drug mules know what they’re doing, that could not be excluded under your rule. But if the expert got up and said, \"I think that this defendant, based on the packaging, was working for this particular drug cartel, and 100% of mules who work for this cartel know that they’re carrying drugs,\" then you say it is excluded. Is that correct?\n\nProsecution: Yes, I think that is the expert expressing an opinion for the jury about the defendant having the requisite mental state. That’s out under Rule 704(b).\n\nJudge: Okay. So, if we go back to the statement that is not excluded, the expert saying, “All drug mules have knowledge of what they’re doing.” I’m just not seeing the difference between that statement and the other one, because everybody knows that this woman was caught in a car with drugs, so she’s a drug mule. The expert is saying all drug mules have knowledge. So, once you tell me that the other statement is excluded, that should be excluded too.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "17", "dialogue": "Judge: Do you understand \"case-by-case basis\" to refer to bank-by-bank basis or to statute-by-statute basis?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Statute-by-statute basis. And the statute says the OCC can extend its inquiry beyond the specific state statute to a substantively equivalent state law. That, in our view, reinforces the sense that it's statute by statute, not case by case.\n\nJudge: And do you think that—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —but bank by bank.\n\nJudge: And do you think that this language in the statute, \"case by case\"—I'm just looking—do you think it is designed to say something about how courts conduct the preemption inquiry? You know, as in this case, because it was brought by a court versus the Comptroller of the Currency? Because I'm just looking at the way that it's structured.\n\nYou know, it says, \"any preemption determination under this paragraph may be made by a court, or by regulation or order of the Comptroller of the Currency on a case-by-case basis,\" and then all the subsequent references to \"case-by-case basis\" refer to the OCC determination. Should I make anything of that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think the two things you should make of it are, first, yes, it is directed just to the OCC, and it seems to have been a reaction to the 2004 OCC regulations, which declared broad categories of state law to be off the table.\n\nJudge: Yes.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And Congress was saying don't do it that way; focus on the impacts of a particular state law.\n\nJudge: Totally agree, which is how I read it, so I'm wondering—I'll try to get to the point of why I'm wondering about it. It seems like, you know, that phrase, \"case-by-case basis,\" itself sounds fact-laden, like we're making factual determinations on a case-by-case basis. But if that language, \"case-by-case basis,\" was designed to stop the OCC from doing what you're saying, does it really carry that implication here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, under Article III case or controversy principles, the courts are already going to be subject to a—\n\nJudge: On a case-by-case basis. Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —a case-by-case basis. And the most relevant language in that provision is that in making a case-by-case determination, the OCC must consider the impact of the particular state law. And that seems clearly to refer to the practical impact. And if that's part of the substantive inquiry, then even though the same case-by-case requirement wouldn't apply to a court, the court should consider impact as well.\n\nJudge: So do you think the court then is bound—even though (b)(3) is referring to the Comptroller, do you think the court should be applying the exact same standard?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The court is certainly bound by the same substantive standard. If you look at (b)(1)—\n\nJudge: Well, (b)(1)(A), (B), and (C), of course.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: But I took you to be referring to (3), moving forward? \"Case-by-case basis\" definition?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I wouldn't—again, the court will naturally be looking at a particular state law just because that's what courts do.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Congress didn't have to worry that courts would announce broad lists of things that couldn't be regulated. And so the court should still consider the impact, the practical impact, but it's not otherwise bound by the procedural requirements—\n\nJudge: Of course.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —by the—\n\nJudge: So it just seems to me then that the court—I'm not sure how much all the talk about \"case-by-case basis\" does for this question of whether this is primarily a legal or factual inquiry for a court.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I'd certainly agree that the ultimate inquiry has both factual and legal components; that is, you have to know the facts, but you also have to make a legal determination—do these facts amount to significant interference?\n\nJudge: Thanks.\n\nJudge: Is there a reason why national banks can't be subjected to the same kinds of evidentiary standards that other plaintiffs have to satisfy when they're making legal claims?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No. National banks—and because we are talking about not the effect this would have on somebody else but the effect it would have on the national banks themselves—not only do they have the wherewithal to satisfy these requirements, but they're in the best position to have the relevant information.\n\nJudge: And they have the wherewithal in part because there's nothing that prevents national banks from hiring lawyers and gathering evidence and presenting them to the court, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: And is there something about economic questions that are not within the competency of the court?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No.\n\nJudge: Don't the courts litigate issues in the realm of economic regulation all the time?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure.\n\nJudge: So I guess I'm wondering, is the showing here really any different than the other standards that I'm talking about? So, for example, I mentioned the undue burden standard in the Title VII scenario. It would seem to me that the showing that a company employer would have to make in Title VII regarding undue burden on its business when accommodating religious employees is really no different in kind than the kind of thing a national bank would have to show if it says this is substantially interfering with my powers.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: All right. So let me ask you about how often such a showing would have to necessarily be made. Did I understand you to say that the preemption determination always requires an evidentiary showing? I think you kind of discussed that, but aren't there circumstances in which a big evidentiary showing wouldn't be necessary?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. There certainly could be cases in which the nature of the restriction had such an obvious impact on the bank that you wouldn't need—\n\nJudge: An obvious impact, for example, like it's directly conflicting with what Congress says about the bank's powers?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That would be one example. Another example would be something like the bank having to pay a 15 or 20 percent interest rate. Now, as was pointed out earlier, that's not going to happen in the real world because states are not going to impose restrictions like that on their own state-chartered banks, and so the non-discrimination requirement will take off the table a lot of the most extreme cases.\n\nJudge: So the big evidentiary showing problem is not going to happen in every case in which the bank is making a claim about preemption?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's correct. And I'd also point out that the bank, to the extent at least that it's worried about enforcement by state officials, doesn't have to wait to be sued. That is, in Barnett Bank, the bank went into court itself and sought a declaratory judgment of preemption, and that would be available.\n\nJudge: Bringing its evidence and its lawyers and that sort of thing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}

But that case made clear that there was a category of cases which were status offenses, which were different from conduct offenses.\n\nJudge: When you started off here today, you said we're just criminalizing conduct. So, to tell you the truth, I thought that this was going to be a question where you would say no, of course, we can't criminalize a status, but there's conduct here.\n\nJudge: And then I was going to say: What is the conduct here? But you didn't say that. You said you could criminalize even the status of homelessness, and that suggests to me that you're off on the wrong track in thinking about this issue.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The point where we are disagreeing here is really about whether the Eighth Amendment is the right framework for this discussion.\n\nJudge: Well, the Eighth Amendment was the framework in that case. And taking that case as a given, where the ruling said the Eighth Amendment protects you against status-based crimes—that's what the question is.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think that ruling extends that far. I think it was limited in scope, and I believe the plurality opinion in another case discusses this and how that was the right line.\n\nJudge: Okay. What is the conduct here?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The conduct is camping, establishing a campsite. And it's the same as in the federal regulations that the National Park Service relies on.\n\nJudge: So I didn't think that was the conduct. I thought that the only conduct here was sleeping outside with a blanket.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, it is the conduct of establishing a campsite, which includes making a bed with bedding or other materials—\n\nJudge: Well, a campsite suggests something different to people. It suggests a tent. It suggests a conglomeration of people. Tent camps, if you will. But your ordinance does not just prohibit that.\n\nJudge: Your ordinance prohibits a single person who is homeless—so does not have another place to sleep—that’s a status, I don’t have another place to sleep—a single person sleeping instead in public with a blanket. That’s what I understand your statute to do. Is that not what your statute does?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: The statute does not say anything about homelessness. It’s a generally applicable law.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I got that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It’s very important that it applies to everyone—even people who are camping.\n\nJudge: But it's a single person with a blanket.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And—\n\nJudge: You don’t have to have a tent. You don’t have to have a camp. It’s a single person with a blanket.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: And sleeping in public is considered conduct. This Court has previously discussed that, and that is conduct. Also, the federal regulations—\n\nJudge: Well, sleeping is a biological necessity. It’s sort of like breathing.

Now, there are a number of possible answers. Suppose there is a liberty interest, okay? You say you are entitled to something.\n\nThat something could be:\nA) The State Department says we believe he’s involved in criminal activity.\nB) We believe he’s a member of a gang.\nC) We believe he’s a member of a particular gang.\nD) We believe he’s a member of MS-13.\nE) This is why we believe he’s a member of MS-13.\nF) We believe that, and you have an opportunity to rebut it.\n\nNow, how do we determine which of those you get unless we are weighing one thing against another?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: By looking to what the Department of Homeland Security does domestically.\n\nJudge 2: Okay. That doesn’t tell me anything about what the Constitution requires. One final question. Where does your cause of action come from?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: From the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n\nJudge 2: Is it an Ex parte Young cause of action?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: This issue hasn't been raised below, so our cause of action arises under the Constitution, Your Honor.\n\nJudge 2: Directly under the Constitution?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s correct.\n\nJudge 2: It's not Ex parte Young?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It arises from the Due Process Clause.\n\nJudge 2: It’s not under the APA?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We raised an APA claim below. If the Court wants to remand on that issue, they may, but we believe it's a constitutional case, Your Honor.\n\nJudge 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nJudge 3: There are some of my colleagues who believe that the Constitution does not, on its face, provide a cause of action. We have a number of cases suggesting that, and many of my colleagues take that position. If they believe that, does Ex parte Young help you?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Your Honor, I am not prepared to discuss Ex parte Young because this did not come up below. We think that our cause of action arises under the Constitution. We also think it comes from Section 702 of the APA, which provides a different route, but that’s our position.\n\nJudge: Justice, do you have a question?\n\nJudge 4: So, just to follow up on the previous questions, if there's a liberty interest, then the Mandel standard applies. The Mandel standard was applied in a previous ruling. That requires a facially legitimate basis and a bona fide factual basis, right?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That’s the test, yes.\n\nJudge 4: And then the question becomes, what does that entail? In a previous case, the government cited a broad statutory provision and was not required to provide more details. The ruling stated that Congress assigned discretion to the executive branch in these matters.\n\nIf we follow that precedent, that is very problematic for your argument. Tell me why it is not.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We don't think it's a problem, Your Honor, because of key distinctions between this case and the previous one. The main distinction, if I understand Your Honor’s line of questioning, is the statutory text. The terrorism bar has specific language defining a terrorist organization, terrorist activity, and intent requirements.\n\nJudge 4: That’s your main distinction, but the problem for you is that in the previous case, the government was not required to provide a more specific provision, even though the statute covered a broad range of conduct. That seems like a very thin distinction.\n\nI'll give you a brief chance to respond.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure. The critical phrase in the previous ruling was that the statute contained discrete factual predicates.

{"id": "820", "dialogue": "Judge: Justice Jackson?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, going to Justice Kagan's point, I mean, there is a difference between \"false\" and \"misleading,\" but I take it that the government's argument is that the facts here don't really implicate that difference.\n\nSo, in other words, you know, it would be as if, in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the question to the doctor was: How many times have you done this surgery? And for whatever reason, the doctor said 10, when, really, he had done a hundred.\n\nThat wouldn't be misleading.\n\nThat would be false in the government's view, correct?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Correct.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: All right.\n\nAnd so just one other point about what the government's position has always been on this.\n\nWhen you said in response -- in --in the colloquy with Justice Gorsuch about what the government's position had been in the brief of opposition, could it be that you were referring to the first paragraph of the argument section, where you say on page 5 that: Petitioner renews his claim that he did not make any false statement within the meaning of 114, but his statements were false by any measure, and his contrary argument would not entitle him to relief in any circuit.\n\nNo further review is warranted.\n\nAnd so your initial argument is that this is a false statement.\n\nAnd the part that Justice Gorsuch was reading was B on page 6, where you say: Even if Petitioner had only made a misleading statement, he still would have violated.\n\nBut the government's point throughout this is that this should be characterized as a false statement.\n\nIs that right?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd if I could just clarify my --my back-and-forth with Justice Gorsuch.\n\nWe -- I understood our brief to take the position that falsity -- that we are understanding the word \"false\" --and that includes contextual falsity.\n\nWe have argued that Petitioner's statements were false.\n\nThe jury was instructed that way.\n\nIf we introduced confusion about whether or not a broader array of things that do not qualify as false but could be described as misleading counts, that is not the government's position, and I hope that I've clarified that today.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nMr. Gair, rebuttal?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: When we're looking at a statute, the most important thing is for us to look at the text of the statute.\n\nThe government is committing the fundamental error of atextualism that this Court condemned in Wells and many other cases, where it is trying to supply an additional term to the statute, a term that is used in many other statutes, when Congress means to get at the perception of the listener about a statement, and that is the term \"misleading.\" Wells teaches us that you can't imply the -- a new term into the statute because the court thinks it might be a good idea or because close is good enough for government work.\n\nIt's not.\n\nJustice Thomas's opinion for the Court in Rotkiske is another prime example of a statute where --in that case, it was the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nThe question was whether the statute of limitations implied a discovery rule.\n\nAnd the Court's opinion there made clear -- looked at statutes that had been passed after the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act that had a discovery rule, as well as statutes passed before, and found that the statutory context rebutted the -- the atextualist argument that you should imply a -- a discovery rule into the statute.\n\nI think everyone, except possibly my friends with the government, recognize that there's a difference between \"false\" and \"misleading.\" And some of the Court's questions to the government asked: How do you draw that line? And my suggestion is the line is drawn by Congress because, when Congress means for the relevant context to include the perception of the listener, it says misleading.\n\nIt doesn't say just false. And the Court has offered a number of hypotheticals that clearly draw the line between misleading and false.\n\nAnd this Court's recent decision in the Macquarie case dealing with 10 -- Section 10b -5 could not be a clearer example. The Court there, of course, was dealing with a pure omission, but it had a nice explication of Rule 10b -5 and said the first section, the false statements part of 10b-5, deals with express falsehoods.\n\nThe second section of 10b -5 deals with statements that say the truth but omit a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading.\n\nCongress has done that in a hundred different places, but it didn't do it here.\n\nAnd -- and so we --we should -- we should heed the text and recognize that because Congress did not use the word \"misleading,\" it was not intending that the perception of the listener matters.\n\nAs we all know, falsity is an objective question.\n\nAnd despite the fact that people of the younger generation may talk about \"I want to speak my truth,\" there is no such thing as \"my truth.\" It's -- it -- it's true as an objective matter. I -- I do want to touch on a couple of things -- other things that the government suggested.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit did -- and I'm very glad my friend mentioned it --say that the implication of this was false.\n\nThe impression created was false.\n\nBut -- but that begs the question.\n\nImpression and implication go to the perception of the listener.\n\nThe court never said it was false as an objective matter.\n\nInstead, it said that it -- it was not deciding that question.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Thank you.\n\nJudge: The case is submitted.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "714", "dialogue": "Judge: When you say that we should say something favorable about bifurcation, do you mean we should just say that it's a discretionary determination for trial judges, or you want us to hint more than that?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, I think, as I understand the argument on the other side, it's that you should not apply the Sixth Amendment here because it would prejudice defendants.\nAnd so there's a ready answer to that question, which is bifurcation.\nIt's the time-honored solution Justice Thomas identified in his Apprendi concurrence and we show in the papers has been endorsed by the Court in the past.\nI think the Spencer v. Texas case from the '60s was one in which the Court, I think, gently endorsed bifurcation, and that was a state case.\nThis is a federal case. And so I think the Court, if it wanted to, could express a little more support for that.\nFrankly, I don't know what the argument would be against bifurcation.\nAs I said, there are only a handful of cases a year where this is even going to arise. There are fewer—right now, there are fewer than 200 ACCA cases a year, and, of course, most of those are plea bargains.\nSo there's only a handful of cases a year.\nAnd bifurcation occurs in things like criminal forfeiture, it occurs in all kinds of civil cases, and so just to move the fact-finding from the judge over to the jury, I don't think it's very much to ask.\n\nJudge: The broader argument on the other side by the amicus is that the historical practice is much more mixed and that there were a variety of practices in the 1800s and earlier—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —1900s on this question and that recidivism, the question of whether a defendant committed prior offenses, was not routinely put before juries, in part because it was related to punishment and in part because it was perceived as different, because it's harmful to defendants in most cases to have it paraded before the jury.\nSo that historical practice, I think, because it's mixed, actually supports Almendarez-Torres and supports, arguably, the amicus says—I want to get your response—the approach that they're suggesting here and that Descamps and Mathis were statutory cases, not constitutional cases. Your response?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\nSo I think the history question is an important one, and then I'll turn to Descamps and Mathis.\nAnd starting with the way you should look at the history question, we think, after Gaudin and Apprendi, the question would be whether amicus can show a uniform or near-uniform—\n\nJudge: Why—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —historical tradition.\n\nJudge: —why is that? I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: But that's a key point.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I—\n\nJudge: I think it's the burden usually to establish a constitutional right because it's not in the text.\nThe text, we have to—and, therefore, we have to look at what the understanding of that text was, and we look at historical—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yeah.\n\nJudge: —practice, and it would seem to me, to get something established in the Constitution, you would need to show more of a uniform historical practice, which I think some of the prior writings and commentary have assumed.\nBut, when you get into it, it's a more mixed picture, I think.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So—\n\nJudge: So those are two different questions.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: No, I think there's a lot there and we want to work through it.\nAnd I will say, to cut to the chase, I think whatever test you apply on the history and tradition, we're going to win, but I think what the test is is perhaps an important question for the future.\nAnd if you look at Gaudin, that's a Sixth Amendment jury trial case, and what the Court says is, to carve out an exception from the general rule that the jury has to find all the elements, the government in that case or the other side has to show an overwhelming history and tradition.\nAnd I think, once Apprendi extended the Gaudin all-elements rule to any fact that increases a sentence and creates what the Apprendi Court itself called the general rule, subject only to the exception of Almendarez-Torres, then—\n\nJudge: Well—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —to fall in that exception, I think you have to make the Gaudin—but let me—\n\nJudge: —as you well know, whether you call it the rule or the exception kind of loads the dice, but the established principle in some states from early on in our history was that these issues were not put before the jury.\nYou can call that the exception or the rule.\nBut recidivism was not put before the jury precisely because it's so harmful—\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Well, let's just cut right to that then.\n\nJudge: Yeah.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think that mix has identified only four states where recidivism was put to the judge instead of the jury when it increases a defendant's sentence—\n\nJudge: Right.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: —up until the mid-20th century.\n\nJudge: Right.

{"id": "94", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Defendant: But I -- but I think it's quite clear, though, that if you're saying to a company: You have to stop talking unless somebody else does something, and that's imposed by the force of law, it directly affects that company's speech. That's --\n\nJudge: Well, it's -- it's --it's --again, I don't -- I don't know if it's directly affecting the company's speech or the speech of third parties. And I'm not sure what -- you know, where your -- your emphasis is. But, again, I'm not sure there's another case where we've said that regulating a company has --should be --others' expression should be treated as direct imposition on their speech in terms of a standard of review, for example, when it's based on derivative regulation of corporate structure of somebody else.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, Your Honor, I think that it's -- I --I would concede that this is a pretty unprecedented case. I'm not aware of any time in American history where the Congress has tried to shut down a major speech platform. But I -- I think that if a law imposes a -- a direct regulation on a third party that, in turn, results in shutting down somebody else's speech, and they do it for content-based, viewpoint-based reasons, and, in particular, on this record, because the speaker that is ultimately being shut down, they don't like the speech of that particular platform, that's a real problem. So --\n\nJudge: Well, it may be a real problem or it may not. But I just am wondering if there's any precedent where we have that same connection and that it affects the standard of review. For example, you would treat it as a direct restriction on expression. Even the only thing the law does is say, in this case, somebody other than the Chinese government has to own the platform.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So -- so -- so we don't have any direct precedent along the lines that you're citing, but we do have precedents. We have cases like Arcara, and what Arcara says is, if the law is totally speech-neutral, then that's one thing. We have cases like O'Brien, which say, if the law doesn't care about speech but happens to draw in speech, that's another thing. Both of those cases make clear, however, is that when the law is concerned with the content of the speech, when the justification is based on the content of the speech -- that's cases like Reed too -- then you do trigger strict scrutiny --\n\nJudge: So then I think your argument comes down to: Is this direct concern with speech, or is it concern with the potential for foreign interference with the level of interference in --indirectly? In other words, they're not coming back --the foreign government -- the platform doesn't care what the people are saying on the platform. That's not the -- the concern. The concern is that they are regulating a particular channel of communication. And I just wonder if there's any precedent for that type of thing. They're not saying: We're going to restrict this content and that content but not this. They're just saying: We're going to be in a position where we can control what happens, whether it's based on expression, whether it's based on anything else.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So, Your Honor, I disagree. And I think, if you take a step back and look at this record, I think it is quite clear that it is focused on both current and potential future content on the platform. Here, you don't have just an act that is based on speakers and speech. It's triggered by speech. It's focused on a single speech or the platform itself.\n\nJudge: Thank you. Justice, anything further? Justice?\n\nJustice: What if Congress -- if there were nothing in this Act about content moderation or covert manipulation? What if it was just about preventing what Congress viewed as an enormously powerful, popular application from gathering an arsenal of information about citizens, and they said: This is the worst offender and we're going to require divestiture by this offender? Would there be a First Amendment problem there? And if you think there would be, what would the level of scrutiny be?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes, there would be a First Amendment problem if you had a law like this that was only focused on speakers, those who use user-generated content, other than product, travel, or business reviews, and --\n\nJustice: Well, Congress concludes that this particular entity is the worst, this is the worst offender, and it happens to be an entity that is involved with speech.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If all you had --so I want to make sure I understand the hypothetical. The only provision you have is one that says: This company has to shut down --\n\nJustice: Right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- because of data security.\n\nJustice: Right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I would have a different set of arguments. I think it would still implicate the First Amendment, particularly where you have strong evidence that they were being targeted in part at least because of their speakers and speech. Suppose Congress passed the law that you posited --\n\nJustice: Well, all right, but you're changing the hypothetical by -- by injecting congressional concern about the content of the speech.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Okay. Well, I'll put that to the side.\n\nJustice: So what would your argument be? It would be an equal protection argument --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No. No. I'd still be saying --\n\nJustice: -- based on rational basis? What --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- I'd still be saying that Arcara itself makes clear that where a law disproportionately burdens just a speaker, we have to subject that to scrutiny to suss it out, to suss out whether the asserted interest is the actual interest. There, the asserted interest is in data security. I think I would have a couple of arguments under whatever form of scrutiny you wanted to apply, whether it is strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny, in that context. I would say first that that law is dramatically under-inclusive because it categorically exempts e-commerce apps that this record shows have comparable ties to the foreign country --\n\nJustice: All right. You say -- you say -- I don't want to prolong this too much. You --you say this is not like Arcara, I think primarily because you say that divestiture requires the new company to cease using the algorithm, right?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No. I think it's not like Arcara for a much more fundamental sense. Arcara involved a totally speech-neutral law. It didn't go after speakers at all. If you had a law in Arcara that said we're going to prohibit prostitution in bookstores only, then I think that Arcara would have come out differently. There would have at least been, you know, some kind of intermediate scrutiny, potentially strict scrutiny.\n\nJustice: All right. Well, you're -- you're continuing --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: That's the law that I think is your hypothetical.\n\nJustice: -- you're continuing to walk away from the hypothetical that --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: I don't think so, Your Honor.\n\nJustice: -- I proposed for the purpose of narrowing in on what your -- on what your argument is. My -- I understood you to say that it -- this -- that would not be a -- a solution to the problem because one of Congress's motivations was -- was the content -- was based on the content of the platform. Am I wrong in that? Did I read your argument incorrectly?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Well, I think the -- I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. I certainly think that because one of the motivations was content, that is an enormously important fact. I was trying to answer your hypothetical where we were trying to take that out of the mix. And the reason why Arcara is different is because Arcara didn't just simply say no prostitution in bookstores. That's what your hypothetical effectively says. It says no data security problems in speakers or in this particular speaker. And I think that that would trigger at the very least intermediate scrutiny.\n\nJustice: All right.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: And then --\n\nJustice: Thank you.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Thank you.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "849", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, does it make sense to view the Fifth Amendment as providing a right to sue for compensation, but your ability to vindicate that right is totally dependent on Congress's discretionary choice to create lower federal courts and to give them jurisdiction to entertain such claims? That sounds like a very weak right if that—if it's subject to limitation in that way.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I think the same could be said of the entire Bill of Rights, though, Your Honor. The entire stratum of federal constitutional rights depends on Congress to create lower federal courts, courts where these rights can be vindicated. Once Congress does create those courts, and when a state defendant deliberately chooses to avail itself of those courts, the only question is whether that court can enforce the ongoing obligation to require the payment of just compensation.\n\nAnd I think that's ultimately what distinguishes this case from the Court's Bivens cases, where Bivens cases are about the policy question of whether to create a remedy. They don't engage in constitutional text, history, and tradition analysis, which is why Justice Rehnquist could dissent in cases like Carlson v. Green and Davis v. Passman and then, less than a decade later, Chief Justice Rehnquist could write First English, because we're not talking about a damages remedy; we're talking about the power of the federal courts to, when their jurisdiction is competently invoked and when the state has waived its sovereign immunity, require the state to comply with its ongoing constitutional duty.\n\nI think that matches both with the history, it matches with the tradition, and it matches particularly with the Fourteenth Amendment context itself. It's worth remembering that when this Court incorporated the Fifth Amendment against the states in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, it specifically incorporated the right to compensation, not the right not to have the property taken but the right to receive money, that the due process of law necessarily included as a matter of first principles—Chicago, Burlington actually doesn't cite the Fifth Amendment—but, as a matter of first principles, it includes the right to receive compensation for the property taken.\n\nThese cases rarely appear in federal court, in part because, before Knick, no takings case could be filed ab initio, but also because, as the magistrate judge's opinion in this case points out, it's relatively rare for a state to choose to remove this federal claim—this federal right into a federal forum. But, once it does so, once Texas has decided it wants the scope of our rights under the Fifth Amendment to be litigated in federal court, that can't change the scope of the claim we make.\n\nWhat the Fifth Circuit opinion below says is that we cannot state a claim invoking our rights under the Fifth Amendment, full stop. If Texas is right that, in fact, we have that right as a matter of Texas common law, then the Fifth Circuit was wrong to say that we only have that right under Section 1983. That counsels in favor of reversal.\n\nBut this Court has also squarely held and again repeated in Knick that the Fifth Amendment does furnish a basis on which a court can award just compensation. In the mine run of cases, that's going to be a state court awarding just compensation. But, when the state wishes to be in federal court, I don't think there's a good-faith basis for the plaintiff to say, I'm invoking my rights under the Fifth Amendment, I want the full scope of compensation that I'm entitled to under the Fifth Amendment, but I refuse to allow this claim that arises under my rights under the Fifth Amendment to be in federal court.\n\nIt is the defendant's choice to have this federal claim that turns on federal law heard in federal court. That's the choice that Texas made, and that choice can't, on the merits, extinguish our Fifth Amendment remedy.\n\nWhat Texas has effectively accomplished here by making the unusual decision to remove is that it's eliminated the Fifth Amendment question from this case and given itself what it believes—I'm not conceding that they're right about Texas law—but what it believes is a more favorable rule of Texas law.\n\nBut, if First English is right and the just compensation remedy is mandatory, then the just compensation remedy is mandatory, and Texas can't extinguish it through procedural maneuvers like removing this case to federal court. A claim for just compensation simply takes the form of saying the government has taken a property interest, and I as the former owner am entitled to the fair market value of that property interest.\n\nJudge: Can I just be clear, are you arguing that through Texas's maneuvering that claim is no longer available to you?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. I think that's what Judge Oldham points out in his dissent below.\n\nJudge: I understand not in federal court, but are you claiming that Texas has prevented you from making this claim in state court?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Yes, Your Honor. There will be no remand in this case. This case is staying in federal district court. And as Judge Oldham correctly pointed out, the upshot of the panel opinion below is that this case will proceed without any federal takings claim in it because—\n\nJudge: If you had sought remand and it went back to Texas court, are you saying that there wouldn't be the opportunity to make this claim in state court? I'm just trying to understand if the claim is totally gone as a general matter here.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I—so I—I think—I see my light is on. Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: No, go ahead.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: So I think, Your Honor, first, I don't know that we would have had grounds to fight remand because the claim does invoke our entitlement under federal law. But, if the case were remanded, I think the question in Texas state court would be exactly the Question Presented here: Are we entitled, without the 1983 vehicle, to invoke our rights under the Fifth Amendment?\n\nTexas courts have said yes, we are entitled to invoke our rights under the Fifth Amendment. But, again, they just cite the Fifth Amendment. They're not invoking some special cause of action that they have created. They, like other courts, look to the Constitution, to this Court's analysis of the Constitution, and say the Constitution provides the entitlement to just compensation, not, as far as I'm aware, an independent common law cause of action.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "51", "dialogue": "Judge: Well, two points. So, first, even the federal regulations prohibit even sleeping. They don't even require any materials, including but --but not necessary under the federal regulation. So this is conduct that is understood by jurisdictions nationwide and even the federal government to be conduct that is prohibited, and so I want to make that point.\n\nDefense Lawyer: See, I'll --\n\nJudge: The second point --\n\nDefense Lawyer: -- I'll tell you the truth, Ms. Capoor. I think that this is -- this is a super-hard policy problem for all municipalities. And if you were to come in here and you were to say, you know, we need certain protections to keep our streets safe and we can't have, you know, people sleeping anyplace that they want and we can't have, you know, tent cities cropping up, I mean, that would create one set of issues. But your ordinance goes way beyond that.\n\nYour ordinance says as to a person -- and I understand that you think it's generally applicable, but we only come up with this problem for a person who is homeless, who has the status of homelessness, who has no other place to sleep, and your statute says that person cannot take himself and himself only and, you know, can't take a blanket and sleep someplace without it being a crime.\n\nAnd -- and -- and that's, you know -- well, it just seems like Robinson. It seems like you're criminalizing a status.\n\nDefense Lawyer: Well, it is not. And we agree with you that this is a very difficult policy question, and that's exactly --\n\nJudge: But that -- it isn’t.\n\nDefense Lawyer: -- why the Eighth Amendment --\n\nJudge: Can you answer why?\n\nJudge: Can I --\n\nJudge: Why is it not? Just -- I mean, the issue has been laid out clearly. You're making a distinction between status and conduct. Okay. We see that. And you keep saying this is conduct. Can you explain why?\n\nDefense Lawyer: The actus reus element, that's exactly what was missing in Robinson and that's what we have here. And that's why that law was so unique. It's a very peculiar --\n\nJudge: So it seems to me that Robinson actually hurts you and not helps you in the following sense. You know, it seems both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs.\n\nSo, here, unlike in Robinson, where, you know, you had at least the sort of disease state, drugs and -- and -- and the like, and potentially culpable acts that relate to that disease state, here, we're talking about sleeping that is universal, that is a basic function.\n\nAnd so I guess what I don't understand is in this circumstance why that particular state is being considered conduct for the purpose of punishment.\n\nDefense Lawyer: Well, I think that just illustrates the line-drawing problems because, if you look at biological necessities and what a person needs to do, you know, the Ninth Circuit's decisions in this area would allow --\n\nJudge: Can I give you a hypothetical?\n\nDefense Lawyer: Yes. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Okay. So suppose the relevant ordinance prohibited eating on public property rather than sleeping or camping. We're talking about eating.\n\nAnd the city, for very, you know, rational reasons, has determined that when people eat outdoors, it creates problems with trash and rodents and the like, and so it bans eating in public places and it punishes violators.\n\nNow, just as here, that seems generally fine because most people have restaurants that they can go to, most people have houses that they can eat in.\n\nBut some people don't have that option. They have to eat in public because they're unhoused and they can't afford to go to a restaurant.\n\nSo is -- is your argument the same result, no Eighth Amendment problem, no problem with the city banning eating in public, even though that's a human necessity that everyone engages in, and, really, what's happening is you're only punishing certain people who can't afford to do it privately?\n\nDefense Lawyer: Well, it sounds like -- I take for a moment that you're not saying the law -- that the law draws lines on any sort of irrational basis or any equal protection issue --\n\nJudge: No. The city has a rational basis.\n\nDefense Lawyer: -- and --\n\nJudge: When people eat in public --\n\nDefense Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- there is trash, there are rodents, there are problems. So the city says what we're going to do is we're going to say no eating in public.\n\nWhat I'm concerned about from your argument is the suggestion -- you know, you call it conduct, I appreciate that, but what we have happening in operation is that people who are able to afford doing this thing that's a basic human need privately are okay. They're not punished for it.\n\nBut people who don't have any other option or opportunity except for to do it in public are the ones who are being targeted by this statute.\n\nDefense Lawyer: So two responses. First, I think the Eighth Amendment is the wrong way to look at it. Someone might have a due process challenge to a law like that if there is a deeply entrenched liberty interest.\n\nJudge: But punishment is happening. In my hypothetical, people are going to jail because they're eating in public.\n\nDefense Lawyer: So, in that case --\n\nJudge: Why is the Eighth Amendment not implicated?\n\nDefense Lawyer: -- in that case, you would have a defense under Oregon law, for example, a necessity defense.\n\nJudge: Counsel, on -- on -- on --\n\nDefense Lawyer: And I want to get to that on the camping.\n\nJudge: Counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\nDefense Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: But, on that point, I think we're having some debate about where to lodge the defense, whether it's under the Eighth Amendment or under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBut do you concede that there are instances in which a necessity defense, long recognized at common law, would apply to eating in public, sleeping in public, or other things like that?\n\nDefense Lawyer: Yes, I agree. And, actually, here, in the case of camping, Oregon law recognizes a necessity defense, so as a matter of state law and policy -- and, again, that goes to the difficult policy questions -- that's why states are able to address the needs of what this issue raises.\n\nAnd so, for something under Oregon State law, a person could raise that defense under the necessity defense, and then, if that's not enough, if they believe that that's not broad enough somehow --\n\nJudge: And you're saying --\n\nDefense Lawyer: -- they can argue due process.\n\nJudge: -- Oregon law has that defense --\n\nDefense Lawyer: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- already built into it?\n\nDefense Lawyer: That's correct.\n\nJudge: All right. Thank you.\n\nJudge: Let me ask you about Oregon law, because one sort of threshold concern that I have about this case is I understand that Oregon has enacted a statute, a new statute, that seems to address this very issue, so I'm trying to understand why this is -- is still a live case.\n\nAs I read the new law, it essentially codifies Martin's rule, that it says something about all regulations of this nature have to be objectively reasonable as to time, place, and manner with regard to -- with regards to people experiencing homelessness.\n\nSo it seems like the state has already precluded Grants Pass from doing the sort of thing it's doing here, so why do we need to weigh in on that?\n\nDefense Lawyer: Well, no, it hasn't. So, first, both sides agree that this case is not moot. There is no state law challenge in this case.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "158", "dialogue": "Judge: Again, I'm talking about the --\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: But I don't think that the Court could draw the same conclusion here.\n\nJudge: -- I'm not talking about the compelling interest or any of that.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Right.\n\nJudge: I'm talking about the tailoring. And -- and you're saying we have no alternative but to stop this speech altogether. We can't -- we can't rely on disclosure. But you say that wouldn't apply to Politico or to the Oxford University Press because?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: In the circumstance where you have a newspaper that is understood to reflect its publisher's views, then you might think that disclosure would be a more adequate remedy there because it's not just holding itself out as a forum for speech between other people. I think social media platforms do raise distinct interests in this regard because what people think when they're engaging with TikTok is that it's organically feeding them videos based on the recommendation engine. And if actually China is behind the scenes engaging in this kind of covert operation, it does present a distinct national security risk. Of course, the other big difference with a newspaper is it's not likely to be collecting sensitive personal information about 170 million-plus people and then having the capacity to send that back to a foreign adversary.\n\nJudge: General Prelogar, can I --\n\nJudge: Counsel --\n\nJudge: Oh.\n\nJudge: Go ahead.\n\nJudge: -- I was just going to say, did I understand you to say a few minutes ago that one problem that Byte -- is that ByteDance might be, through TikTok, trying to get Americans to argue with each other?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That it might be just trying to foment disruption or --\n\nJudge: If they do, I say they're winning.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That might very well be true, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the point I'm trying to make is that China is a foreign adversary nation that looks for every opportunity it has to weaken the United States and to try to threaten our national security. And if it has control over this key communications channel, it's hard to predict ex ante exactly how it's going to use that as a tool to harm our interests. But we know it's going to try first and foremost by seeking to get the data of these American users, which would be of a piece of all of the activity the PRC has already undertaken to breach our laws, hack OPM, for example, and exfiltrate the background files and security clearances of 20 million government employees, the breach of Equifax to get sensitive financial data, Anthem to get sensitive healthcare data. We know that the PRC has a voracious appetite to get its hands on as much information about Americans as possible, and that creates a potent weapon here because the PRC could command that ByteDance comply with any request it gives to obtain that data that's in the hands of the U.S. subsidiary.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Suppose --\n\nJudge: General Prelogar -- go ahead.\n\nJudge: Suppose that TikTok had no connection whatsoever with any foreign government. It was owned instead by an immensely, immensely rich multinational corporation, and Congress concluded that this multinational corporation really has it in for the United States and is going to use this extremely popular platform to do everything it can to undermine the United States in all the ways in which you think that TikTok may -- may pursue at the direction of the PRC. Would this --would that be the same case?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think there would be a first-order question of whether the multinational corporation itself has First Amendment rights.\n\nJudge: All right. It's a -- it's an American corporation.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So, if it were an American corporation, I think that --and Congress disagreed with the viewpoints or content the corporation would display, obviously, that's a direct regulation of protected speech, and it would trigger strict scrutiny. I think that's different in kind from what Congress was worried about here, which was not regulating speech as such but instead regulating foreign adversary control and --\n\nJudge: So your whole -- your argument depends on the fact that what is at bottom here is the -- the People's Republic of China using TikTok. That's what your argument depends on. If this were an American corporation, it would be an entirely different thing.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Exactly. And the reason we know this statute is different is because all of the same speech that's happening on TikTok could happen post-divestiture. The Act doesn't regulate that at all. So it's not saying you can't have pro-China speech, you can't have anti-American speech. It's not regulating the algorithm. TikTok, if it were able to do so, could use precisely the same algorithm to display the same content by the same users. All the Act is doing is trying to surgically remove the ability of a foreign adversary nation to get our data and to be able to exercise control over the platform.\n\nJudge: General Prelogar -- oh, sorry.\n\nJudge: I'm sorry.\n\nJudge: I just wanted you to respond to Mr. Fisher's argument about the rights of Americans to receive information, say, from the PRC or anyone else and that even if ByteDance did not itself have First Amendment rights, that Americans would have a First Amendment right to --to receive that information in the Lamont sense.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Yes. So I think that Lamont reflected a principle that there can be a right of American listeners to receive information. And if Congress is directly regulating that based on disagreement with the speech that's being sent into this country, that's obviously going to trigger heightened scrutiny under the First Amendment. But, here, I think the users have to be asserting a different type of interest because what Congress was safeguarding against was not the ability of TikTok to continue to operate or the users to post content. It was focused only on foreign adversary control. And so the users would have to demonstrate that they have some unqualified First Amendment right to post on a platform that's controlled by a foreign adversary, which could use that access to then threaten our nation's security by gathering data on tens or hundreds of millions of Americans and also use it for covert influence operations of whatever form. And I don't think there's a First Amendment right to do that.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "429", "dialogue": "Judge: So it seems to me that your causation rule eviscerates the kind of plaintiff dynamic that I explored with Ms. Anand.\nAnd maybe you can help me understand why that's not the case. So I said we have a person who is a criminal, and he's committing crimes.\nAnd he has got three or four of them absolutely dead to rights, but one of them, no.\nOne of them, he says, this additional thing, whatever it is, I didn't do it.\nAnd because I'm, you know, a career criminal, the police officer knows me from way back when, and he actually tacked that on after he made stuff up and he -- this charge is a malicious prosecution.\nIt seems to me that if we buy your rule of causation, so, first of all, we don't say, you know, any charge, he still gets to go forward, just because there are these other charges, he still gets to go forward on that basis, but you're knocking him out basically for the same reason on the causation prong.\nYou're saying because you have these other charges for which you could have been arrested, and perhaps he even agrees to that, you're not allowed, because you can't say that the baseless charge caused. And I guess I don't understand why that's the case.\nWhy shouldn't he still be able to make his claim on the civil docket with respect to the malicious prosecution of that one charge?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think you've absolutely highlighted the distinction between our positions.\nI think Williams versus Aguirre, which Petitioner embraces, would hold that you could make out a per se constitutional violation for that alleged malicious prosecution. And we think that's incorrect.\nAnd we think that's because of the operation of the Fourth Amendment. The correct rule is a Fourth Amendment rule.\nHow could you have a per se constitutional violation for an unreasonable charge, which the Fourth Amendment does not forbid, without an unreasonable seizure? And -- and we think it's the Fourth Amendment that does the work there.\n\nJudge: So what if the other crimes are all misdemeanors and he can show -- we have this coming up in other cases -- that no one would ever have been prosecuted or held or detained for the three other things.\nYes, he says, I did those things, but those are not things for which people get detained. It's the one they made up.\nAnd that's, in fact, why they made it up because they wanted me to go to jail.\nDoes he go forward or no under your causation prong?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: We still think it is the overlay of existing Fourth Amendment precedent that asks about that objectively.\nAnd -- and that means that if those misdemeanor charges, regardless of local practice, even if it hadn't been local practice to arrest for those, the Fourth Amendment says you can arrest for even a fine-only offense.\nThat's Atwater versus City of Lago Vista. And the Fourth Amendment also allows an arrest, even if it would be unlawful under state law.\nThat's Virginia versus Moore.\nThose don't violate the Fourth Amendment, so you can hold those individuals.\nNow, it would be a different case if the detention is for 18 months, for example.\nAnd the only probable cause that supports it are for these very minor misdemeanor offenses.\n\nJudge: Well, it doesn't matter to you at all if there's evidence that he puts forward that no one would ever -- that this magistrate, in fact, wouldn't have or didn't, you know, go forward with respect to this -- authorizing this detention but for the baseless charge that -- that was put there in order to get him to go to jail?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's right.\nWe think that is exactly the kind of analysis that the Fourth Amendment forecloses.\nAnd I can point to Whren, Virginia versus Moore, that all say the Fourth Amendment reasonableness does not depend on local practice.\nIt doesn't depend on state law.\nIt doesn't vary from place to place and from time to time.\nAnd that is just settled Fourth Amendment law.\n\nJudge: Counsel, let's say I -- I understand all that and maybe -- maybe even am slightly sympathetic to it.\nBut what about the Fourteenth Amendment and what about the common law malicious prosecution claims, which didn't depend upon showing that all the charges against me were false?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I think those standards could definitely be different.\nUnder those, I think under state law, there is no requirement that you show a seizure, so the analysis would be different.\nThat claim has been abandoned by this stage in the litigation. And, yes, under the Fourteenth Amendment, you wouldn't have this requirement to show a seizure.\nI think the analysis would be different if the Court were to recognize it in the future.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.

{"id": "892", "dialogue": "Judge: -- in that?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I mean, that -- that -- the predicate exception begins by talking about the action in which the manufacturer knowingly violated and --and the violation was a proximate cause, including the -- the exceptions that are mentioned.\r\n\r\nSo that -- so aiding and abetting these violations of federal and state statutes pertaining to guns is exactly what this exception was built to do.\r\n\r\nThat is why it was carved out in this bipartisan legislation.\r\n\r\nBut, on your remedies question, one of the difficulties I think for all of us is that we're here so early.\r\n\r\nThis is a complaint that has asked for a number of different remedies, including a number of different types of injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the things that you heard the Petitioners and a lot of their amici in their briefs complain about is what these remedies might do.\r\n\r\nThat is for the district judge on remand to make sure that the judge equitably crafts a remedy that is designed to limit the harm to Mexico.\r\n\r\nMexico is not trying to legislate gun use in the United States.\r\n\r\nJudge: Yeah, I understand that.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm just wondering whether the PLCAA statute itself is telling us that we don't want the courts to be the ones to be crafting remedies that amount to regulation on this industry.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I think --\r\n\r\nJudge: That that was really the point of the entire thing.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to the extent that we're now reading an exception to allow the very thing that the statute seems to preclude, I'm concerned about that.\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Justice, if PLCAA had wanted to preclude any lawsuit against a manufacturer, including for instances where the manufacturer had committed a wrong, it could have done that, as so many different states, in fact, did.\r\n\r\nWhat PLCAA did in this effort, which, as I mentioned, was joined by members of both parties, was to carefully carve out circumstances where the manufacturer or the seller was -- was alleged to have done something wrong.\r\n\r\nThe thing they were concerned about was lawful design and manufacture and sale of product and injury solely caused by others. That is replete throughout the purpose section of PLCAA.\r\n\r\nPLCAA could have been designed quite differently.\r\n\r\nIt was designed this way for a reason, so that harmful actions by manufacturers and sellers breaking the law could continue to be remedied.\r\n\r\nThat was exactly the point.\r\n\r\nJudge: You've mentioned about four times that it was bipartisan. What's the relevance of that to this -- to our interpretation here?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I -- I think I -- I -- yes.\r\n\r\nI was --I haven't gotten to -- to 13 times yet, but four will do.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's bipartisan, I think, points out particularly in this climate that the --what was being challenged there were really unusual lawsuits that really weren't showing up in any other part of the -- the economy against the manufacturers of a lawful product, selling their product lawfully, distributing their product lawfully, where no allegations were made in those prior lawsuits about unlawful behavior.\r\n\r\nThat was what PLCAA carefully carved out.\r\n\r\nWhat it left, among other things, were actions for things like negligent entrustment, product liability.\r\n\r\nAnd product liability is interesting, by the way, because you probably notice this as well, product liability specifically says you can sue for product liability, but, if it was a criminal act, then that act becomes the sole proximate cause.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, is very different from the violation of which is the --or a proximate cause, which is what you see in the -Subject to Final Review predicate exception.\r\n\r\nI think that language difference is very important.\r\n\r\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask you pretty much the flip side of the question I asked your -- your friend on the -- the other side, which you allege that 2 percent of the guns manufactured in the United States make their way to Mexico.\r\n\r\nI assume the volume of that is critical to your -- your argument, and I just want to know how much is enough, if it's 1 percent or a more miniscule amount.\r\n\r\nWhere -- where's the floor?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: So 2 -- 2 percent is always a question that begs the question of what.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, what you have is data in the complaint that says -- this is paragraph 438 -- between 342,000 and 597,000 of defendants' guns --and, remember, this is not the entire industry we're here talking about -- so up to 600,000 of defendants' guns are likely trafficked into Mexico every year.\r\n\r\nThat's your 2 percent.\r\n\r\nBut I think the issue is not so much whether it's 2 or 10 or 70.\r\n\r\nIt's do these manufacturers know who the rogue dealers are and what they're doing.\r\n\r\nAnd this complaint in all of those paragraphs that I read to you earlier and many others around them specifically says the -- these manufacturers know the trace data that show the dealers, that show the bulk sales that are being made to traffickers who come in repeatedly over a short period of time and bring the guns into Mexico, where they're found at crime scenes.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, more than percentage is important.\r\n\r\nJudge: The -- you -- you emphasize -- you have a number of criteria or examples, you know, the -- the gun says this or it looks like a military weapon and it has an American flag, and, you know, I --Zapata's quote about better to die on your feet than live on your knees.\r\n\r\nI mean, those are all things that are not illegal in any way.\r\n\r\nAnd the idea -- I mean, there are some people who want the experience of shooting a particular type of gun because they find it more enjoyable than using a -- a BB gun.\r\n\r\nAnd I just wonder exactly what the -- the defendant, the manufacturer, is supposed to --to do in that situation.\r\n\r\nYou say no, he shouldn't be marketing a particular legal firearm because they're going to go into Mexico at a higher percentage than -- than others?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's not so much that the defendants are designing a particular gun.\r\n\r\nIt's that what the complaint alleges is that they are designing certain guns to target the Mexican market, including the cartels.\r\n\r\nSo, if you take the example that you gave, this is paragraph 215, Colt produces three models of guns that it specifically targets to the Mexican market: the Super El Jefe, the Super El Grito, and the Emiliano Zapata 1911. These are coveted by the cartels.\r\n\r\nAnd you can see evidence of this at paragraphs 217, 218, 219, 220.\r\n\r\nAnd they are smuggled into Mexico in volume, which you can also find.\r\n\r\nJudge: Do -- do you know what the percentage of those guns that are sold in the United States compared to the ones that are found in Mexico is?\r\n\r\nLawyer of Plaintiff: I don't know, but, again, the percentage, I think, is less important than the allegation that they are smuggled into Mexico in volume and coveted by the cartels, including being found on the person of many cartel chiefs who have been arrested.\r\n\r\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "790", "dialogue": "Judge: Okay. So I guess what I'm concerned about is that I kind of hear you wanting us to do a de novo review, as opposed to a clear error review, because, to the extent that you're now asking us to look at the flaws in the testimony and I guess disagree with the district court's crediting that report, that sounds to me like de novo. I understood from prior cases that the clear error standard is a highly deferential standard, that the Court may not reverse just because it would have decided the matter differently. A finding that is plausible in light of the full record, even if another is equally or more so, must govern. So to what extent do we have to credit the district court's disagreement with your objections to the report?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That's a great question. Let me give a couple of responses. First of all, as you just read, the court has to consider whether it's plausible in light of the entire record and all of the evidence. And, here, the district court just ignored other evidence that was put forward. What we are asking the Court to do is exactly what it did in another case, where the court went through as part of clear error to ensure that the district court had not relied on clearly erroneous expert testimony and a bad methodology.\n\nJudge: Yes, but wasn't there other -- I'm sorry. Wasn't that case a majority/minority district scenario?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: Sure, which, again, is all the more reason why the racial target theory in this case just makes no sense, because there's no clear motivation to --\n\nJudge: No, I understand. You're sort of shifting. I guess I'm just trying -- so keep going.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: So in that case, we had exactly the same situation with the experts. The district court had excluded the defense expert, so that expert wasn't really considered by this Court on review, but this Court went through as part of clear error to ensure that the district court had not relied on clearly erroneous expert testimony and a bad methodology. That's what most of that case found.\n\nJudge: But how does clear error work in that? Like, I understood the standard now to be is it plausible that the district court could have relied on the testimony and could have found it to be reliable? And in the absence of a defense expert that's actually poking methodological holes in it, I think you have a hard time, you know, if our burden is just to say was it plausible that the district court got it right in terms of the crediting of the report?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: I don't think that's exactly what the clear error standard requires.\n\nJudge: All right. So tell me what it requires.\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: It says: Is the district court's finding plausible in light of the whole record?\n\nJudge: And that includes both the expertise and also the district court's credibility findings? Which is another sort of aspect of this that I really wanted to pin down. You say the district court ignored other evidence. But it did have a trial, and it had the actual person who drew the maps come in, and there's testimony in the record where the court itself is questioning directly, not relying on the attorneys, but actually putting questions to that map-drawer. And I'm just wondering how we are to assess the court's determination that it disagreed with or didn't believe the expert when he said, \"I was looking at partisanship and not race.\"\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: There was no credibility determination because the court never based that on his demeanor on the witness stand or at trial. The court credited other evidence, but there was also other evidence the court didn't even discuss, such as the direct testimony from other witnesses.\n\nJudge: So are you saying the court could not have disagreed -- I mean, they asked him the question, moving that line up into the African American areas you would say was for a partisan lean, correct? And the witness says yes. And they ultimately find that that's not so. So why isn't that a finding, \"I disagree, I don't believe you\"?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: A credibility determination requires a determination about the demeanor of the witness on the stand. Otherwise, district courts could always wrap their fact findings in credibility determinations in an attempt to avoid review. They didn't even do that here. There isn't that kind of classic credibility determination. But even setting that aside, there was all kinds of direct testimony from other sources.\n\nJudge: What would a plaintiff have needed -- and this is my final question. What would a plaintiff have needed in your view, direct evidence, a statement that says we are using race and not partisanship in this particular area?\n\nDefendant's Lawyer: That, or an alternative map that disentangled the two, or, if you think the alternative map's not required, a full evidentiary picture that showed that traditional principles actually were subordinated to race. And here, there's been no showing for the reasons I just discussed.\n\nJudge: Thank you.\n\nJudge: Thank you, counsel.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: In the colloquy with Mr. Roberts, the court asked: What would happen if you bring in districts that maybe are not majority Black but are below majority Black? Would that affect the overall BVAP of your district? And he acknowledged that it would.\n\nJudge: Well, when race and partisanship are so closely aligned, as they are in fact, why is it surprising that a legislature that is pursuing a partisan goal would favor a map that turns out consistently to have the same BVAP?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Because, if they're using race as the means to get there, this Court last term said that a legitimate interest cannot be achieved with illegitimate ends.\n\nJudge: Yeah, if that's what they're using. But, if they are disregarding race entirely and looking only at politics, where race and politics are so closely aligned, it isn't surprising that when you want to get a district that has a certain Republican percentage, you're going to get a district that has a steady BVAP.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Two responses to that. Even if the map-maker wasn't just looking at race in the actual documents, the court credited that it was in his mind and that all the evidence reflects that they were looking at race. The fact that they were trying to keep it at 17 percent reflects that it had worked at 17 percent prior to 2018. It worked at 17 percent after 2018. They were defending this map as being least change, a map that had pre-cleared the Department of Justice, that had survived a constitutional challenge.\n\nJudge: What about the precinct in West Ashley? Your opposing counsel mentioned West Ashley.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: West Ashley is cited by the court. This is a historic community that has a lot of mixed precincts, but what we see is that the entirety of the precincts with the highest and most significant Black populations were targeted for movement.\n\nJudge: It's predominantly white, isn't it?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: It's predominantly white, but the precincts with the highest and most significant Black populations, those were targeted for movement. And the court recognized that, yes, white voters may be overall impacted by this map, but because this is a White versus Regester reality on the ground, the court recognized that there were some mixed precincts, and the unrebutted expert evidence is that race was a better predictor for movement and that Black voters were significantly and disproportionately targeted for movement.\n\nJudge: Well, this -- I'm sorry. Did you want to finish your sentence?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: They've never been able to explain that significant sorting, which complies with the question in prior cases.\n\nJudge: Yeah, I think this goes to what the defendant claims is a very serious flaw in Dr. Ragusa's methodology, and I want you to talk about that. Maybe you have a good answer to his argument.\n\nJudge: So let's say the legislature is intent on ensuring that a district has a Republican lead. Then, all else being equal, which of the following two precincts would they rather include in the district: one with 3,000 residents that went 900 to 800 for Trump, or a precinct with 3,000 residents that went 700 to 600 for Biden?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: I would like to know two things with respect to the racial makeup of those precincts because, here, we know that the legislature knew not only the partisan performance based upon the 2020 data but they knew the racial makeup.\n\nJudge: Well, suppose you don't know anything about race, which is what they claim, not that they know -- they didn't take race into account at all. All you had before you were those statistics: 900 to 800 for Trump, 700 to 600 for Biden. You want to make it a Republican district. Which one do you want to keep in?\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: The former. But, if it -- this case would be more like another case if they were actually looking at pure partisan data and they were looking at partisan voting behavior over time to make predictions.\n\nJudge: But that's not this case.\n\nPlaintiff's Lawyer: Exactly.", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
{"id": "1009", "dialogue": "Lawyer of Defendant: -- that is taken solely against an unqualified individual --\n\nJudge: So are you --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- it's not actionable.\n\nJudge: -- citing that if she had properly alleged that she was -- had Parkinson's two years before she retired, that she would be entitled to sue?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If she alleged that the City had a policy that said, if you get Parkinson's --if you have Parkinson's disease, we're not going to pay you a pension, she would have been subject to that policy during her employment as soon as she --\n\nJudge: You're begging the --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- got Parkinson's.\n\nJudge: -- question -- you're trying to qualify in the ways you're not. You're basically saying, if you're retired, you're not entitled to anything, even if you had been made this promise during your time of employment, because you're saying the promise here she relies on, and it's specified in her paragraph 19, was if --we will pay you equally to people who work 25 years or to people whose 25 years encompasses service in the military or in other governments.\n\nAnd she's saying, in whatever year it was, 2010, we're going to change that policy.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: If she's relying on the discriminatory -- as the alleged discriminatory act when we changed the policy in 2003, she would not have been a qualified individual --\n\nJudge: But she was --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: --with a disability at that time.\n\nJudge: -- and she does -- and she was in 2000 -- 2018 when she developed Parkinson's.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: In -- in 2018, she certainly had a disability.\n\nShe was not a qualified individual because she's not --\n\nJudge: Why? She worked two years not being qualified?\n\nJudge: Why was she not a qualified individual in 2018?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Because that's --well, in November of 2018 is when she took her retirement because she became an unqualified individual, meaning somebody totally disabled.\n\nJudge: Was she qualified at the point at which she got the Parkinson's, 2016?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: She would have been a qualified individual at that time, but the policy did not apply to qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe policy would only be applied to somebody who became unqualified, because you have to take a disability retirement, which means you are unable to perform the essential functions of your job.\n\nAt that point, the 24-month subsidy policy would apply to her, and she's no longer qualified at the time the 24-month rule was applied to her. And that's no different from an employer terminating the employment of somebody. They have a disability, but then they become totally disabled.\n\nYou can terminate their employment because they're unqualified at that point.\n\nAnd there's nothing controversial about that.\n\nShe's -- it's only made controversial because it's --for some reason, they're arguing for an exception to the plain language just for retirees.\n\nBut there should be no exception. The -- the language contains no exception.\n\nIt is -- there is a very clear line drawn by Congress to protect only those who can perform the jobs they hold or desire.\n\nAnd, again, it's about when the discrimination occurs.\n\nNobody is arguing, and the Eleventh Circuit certainly did not hold, that she was required to be a qualified individual at the time of her lawsuit.\n\nShe was required to allege that at the time she was discriminated against, she was a qualified individual with a disability.\n\nAnd she is not able to allege, did not allege, and, in fact, disclaimed any argument that she was a qualified --\n\nJudge: I just want to --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: -- individual with a disability.\n\nJudge: -- make sure I understand what you're saying because there is this two-year period where she is a qualified individual, right? She has Parkinson's, but she's able to hold a job.\n\nAnd you don't dispute that.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Correct.\n\nJudge: And she's a qualified individual when the City adopts its policy. That's correct, right? You don't dispute --\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: -- that? And she's a qualified individual when she's earning her retirement benefits.\n\nYou don't dispute that?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No, no, she would not be a qualified individual when she's earning the retirement benefit.\n\nJudge: Earning as opposed to receiving them, right? Like, you know, an employee earns retirement benefits by doing the job.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: We would only dispute as a factual matter that she earned these benefits because she did not satisfy the criteria to earn them, which was 25 years of service.\n\nJudge: I mean, she's just -- I guess what I -- maybe that answered my question.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nI mean, all I was suggesting was that she's a qualified individual doing the job, just like other people are qualified individuals doing the job, such that she's putting herself in line for a package of retirement benefits, correct?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: Yes.\n\nJudge: And -- and the City has passed this policy at the time that she's a qualified individual.\n\nBut you're saying that because the policy addresses the retirement period, all of a sudden, then she's not a qualified individual?\n\nLawyer of Defendant: No.\n\nOur argument is just slightly more nuanced.\n\nIt's the fact that this particular policy only applies to unqualified individuals.\n\nSo what she's saying is discriminatory is the fact that she only received the health insurance subsidy for 24 months after she retired and those who had 25 years of service read the -- received the health insurance subsidy to age 65.\n\nJudge: So you're not saying that any retirement policy only applies to unqualified individuals.\n\nYou're saying this particular retirement policy only applies to unqualified individuals.\n\nAnd -- and -- I'm sorry for being dense, but tell me why.\n\nLawyer of Defendant: So this policy, what she's complaining about is that she only received 24 months of the subsidy instead of receiving it to age 65 like 25 -year retirees receive.\n\nSo she's -- she's arguing that when we applied the 24 -month rule to her and stopped paying at 24 months, that was the discriminatory act.\n\nAnd that was when she was unqualified. And the policy -- the 24-month rule only applies to disability retirees.\n\nAnd that has a very specific meaning.\n\nA -- a disability retiree is not just somebody who has a disability and retires.\n\nA disability retire -- retirement is awarded to people who become completely unable to perform the essential functions of their job, and because of that reason, they take a disability retirement.\n\nThey retire early.\n\nSo the 24-month subsidy policy only applies to those totally disabled.\n\nAnd it would -- they would only become subject to it once they become totally disabled and accept a disability retirement, which is what she did.\n\nIf she had not taken a disability retirement, if she had continued to work for 25 years, she would have received the full subsidy despite having a disability.\n\nSo the policy was only applied to her, the 24-month rule, because she retired early with a disability that rendered her an unqualified individual, and then the City applied the 24-month rule to her.\n\n", "manipulative": "0", "primary_manipulator": null, "manipulation_techniques": null}
