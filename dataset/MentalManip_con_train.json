But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.\nPerson2: And I think certain older persons like you and your \"colleague\" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits.

In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.\nPerson1: Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?\nPerson2: It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.\nPerson1: No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.\nPerson2: It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?\nPerson1: Suit yourself.

I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.\nPerson2: Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.\nPerson1: Go on.\nPerson2: And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.\nPerson1: You learned this in some college course?\nPerson2: I learned a lot of things in college.

I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation. But where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.\nPerson1: He needed money?  For the operation for you?\nPerson2: It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.

Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: \"Wow!\"  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.\nPerson1: Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?\nPerson2: I can't talk to him.\nPerson1: You're in it up to your ass, Leon.

Perhaps you knew this man under another name?\nPerson1: No, I never saw him before in my life.\nPerson2: Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.\nPerson1: Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.\nPerson2: What was so appealing about Houston?\nPerson1: I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.\nPerson2: Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?\nPerson1: Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.\nPerson2: I see.  And where did you drive?\nPerson1: We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.\nPerson2: Why Galveston?\nPerson1: No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.\nPerson2: And then Sunday?\nPerson1: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.\nPerson2: Did you bag any geese on this trip?\nPerson1: I believe the boys got a couple.\nPerson2: But the boys told us they didn't get any.\nPerson1: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.

Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?\nPerson1: Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.\nPerson2: I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.\nPerson1: Why?

The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.\nPerson2: I feel hardly nothing.\nPerson1: You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.\nPerson2: But why be so concerned about me?\nPerson1: This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.\nPerson2: And you?\nPerson1: I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.\nPerson2: I am not ready for this.\nPerson1: You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.\nPerson2: Of course.\nPerson1: You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.\nPerson2: That is not me.\nPerson1: With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.",

You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term \"visiting hours\" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will?

Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.\nPerson1: You haven't seen her yet?\nPerson2: No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...\nPerson1: That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.\nPerson2: That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.\nPerson1: You just told me you hadn't seen her.\nPerson2: Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.\nPerson1: Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?\nPerson2: You can't imagine.\nPerson1: That bad?  Old or young?\nPerson2: Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.\nPerson1: You saw all that in one glimpse?\nPerson2: Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!\nPerson1: Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.",
